## Probabilistic-Modeling

*(NOTE: This README is still a work in progress.)* Welcome! This folder contains code samples in MATLAB that define, fit, and analyze different behavioral models of human decision-making. This goal of this project was to predict human choices as a function of two parallel streams of information: the outcomes of past choices, and visual cues that carry information about how outcome probabilities are changing over time. I built 34 candidate behavioral models, fit data from each subject to each model, and used [Bayesian Model Selection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19306932) to learn which facets of the behavioral models were important for accurate choice prediction. A manuscript from this work is currently under review.
