He reported that the left tank was low, while the right tank had more than one-half tank of fuel. At 7,000 feet msl in the descent, the engine lost power and quit. He was unable to glide to an airport, so he prepared for landing on a road. During the landing, he steered the airplane to avoid an oncoming truck. The left wing struck a pole, resulting in substantial damage. Both main wing fuel tanks gravity feed to a five-gallon sump tank, and an FAA inspector was able to drain approximately two gallons of fuel from the sump tank at the accident site; no fuel could be drained from the main tanks. The tank sight gauges indicated zero in the left tank and well below the lowest mark in the right tank. An additional 4.75 gallons of fuel was recovered during disassembly of the airplane for transport. Inspection of the fuel manifold revealed no evidence of fuel. The owner's representative stated that the low-profile wing tanks would have unusable fuel in a nose-low attitude, since the main tank fuel drains are located aft and inboard on the tank.",

The No. 2 main bearings had extruded from their crankcase positions and exhibited mechanical damage. The\u00a0No. 2 main bearing support displayed signatures consistent with bearing shift. The No. 2 main bearing saddle support and several other bearing saddle supports exhibited fretting, consistent with movement between the engine case halves due to insufficient torque on the case through bolts. Maintenance logbook records showed that the Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 cylinders were replaced about 1 1/2 years before the accident. When maintenance personnel replaced those cylinders, they would have had to remove the nuts on the case through bolts because they also serve as hold-down bolts for the cylinders.

The captain, the non-flying pilot, taxied the airplane.  A relief captain occupied the center cockpit seat, and the first officer occupied the right seat.  The airplane proceeded southbound on taxiway Romeo, a heading of 140 degrees, and was cleared for takeoff on runway 32 by a tower controller as the airplane was approaching taxiway Kilo.  The airplane made a right turn from taxiway Romeo onto taxiway Kilo, a heading of 240 degrees, and came to a stop at the lighted hold line east of the runway 32 extension.  The airplane was expected to have continued west on Kilo into the extended portion of runway 32, and then turned right (north) onto the approach end of runway 32, but the captain requested the \"before takeoff checklist,\" and the first officer, the flying pilot, complied.  Following his completion of the checklist, the captain stated, \"You have control.\"  The airplane accelerated west on taxiway Kilo.  Tower controllers noticed the departure roll, and the airport's emergency phone to the fire department was activated.  The local controller did not make a radio call to the crew to abort the takeoff as he felt it was too late.  The airplane took off, proceeded to its destination and landed without further incident.  After departure, main landing gear tire impressions were found in a snow berm at the west end of taxiway Kilo.  The available taxiway distance from Romeo to the end of Kilo is about 6,800 feet.  The calculated takeoff distance for the airplane was 7,746 feet.  The cockpit navigation display for the Airbus A340 depicts the airplane's heading along a rotating arc near the top of the navigational display, along with a yellow airplane symbol and a white runway symbol.  Taxiway Romeo and Kilo are equipped with green centerline lights having variable illumination intensity through three settings.  The taxiway centerline lights for Romeo and Kilo were set on the standard (level 1) intensity level.  The intersection of taxiway Kilo and Romeo has a yellow centerline stripe in the radius of the turn from Romeo to Kilo, but no centerline lights along the radius of the turn. The intersection of Kilo and the extended portion of runway 32 have a yellow centerline stripe in the radius of the turn from Kilo onto the extended centerline of runway 32, but no centerline lights along the radius of the turn.  The centerline lights of Kilo did not extend through the extended portion of runway 32.  Some reflective material of each taxiway centerline marking was indistinct, missing, or obscured by small patches of ice.  The incident flight was the captain's first trip from Anchorage.  It was the first time he flew with the first officer, and he had flown with the reserve captain on numerous occasions.

The flight was delayed due to poor weather conditions that included visibilities between 1/2 to 3/4 mile in mist and freezing fog. The ceiling varied between 100 feet, to 1,100 feet.

Recovered GPS data revealed that, during the initial departure, the airplane was climbing on the departure runway heading at a rate of about 500 feet per minute and an airspeed that was high enough to provide for an adequate margin above the stall speed.About 84 seconds after takeoff, the pilot initiated a left turn toward the first waypoint. During the next 47 seconds, the left turn was completed, and the airplane continued to climb to its maximum altitude of about 1,500 feet above ground level (agl). The airplane began to descend, and about 24 seconds later, it reached a groundspeed of 144 mph and entered a second left turn. Over the remaining 79 seconds of GPS data, the left turn continued with an accompanying series of three diverging groundspeed and altitude oscillations, ending at a groundspeed of 69 mph and an altitude of about 300 feet agl. Witnesses observed the oscillations, which were followed by a spin to the ground.Ground scars and damage to the airplane were consistent with terrain collision while the airplane was experiencing a flat spin. Postaccident examination revealed no evidence of any airframe or engine failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.  The throttle control was found in the idle position, and the lack of witness marks on the propeller indicated that the engine was operating at low power at the time of impact. These findings are consistent with the spin recovery procedure listed in the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook that requires the engine throttle be set to the idle position. The airplane was equipped with a ferry fuel system consisting of a 238-gallon collapsible bladder tank located in the cabin behind the pilot's seat, above the rear seat pans. At the time of the accident, the bladder tank contained about 121 gallons of additional fuel, which supplemented the 89 gallons carried in the two wing tanks.  The ferry system design required that the bladder tank be attached to the fuselage utilizing ratcheting straps. The pilot installed the system 2 days before the accident, and a mechanic inspected the installation. The mechanic reported that he observed yellow tie down straps installed over the bladder tank; however, no straps were found at the accident site, and the tank appeared to be unrestrained. The ferry system operating instructions required that the fuel selector valve be set to the right tank during takeoff. During the postaccident examination, the valve was found in the left tank position. However, fuel was noted in the engine driven fuel pump, flow divider, and fuel lines forward of the firewall, indicating that the incorrect position of the valve did not result in an interruption to the engine\u2019s fuel supply. In addition to the extra weight of the fuel in the bladder tank, 187 pounds of unsecured baggage was located behind the tank in the aft baggage area, which had a weight limit of 120 pounds. Although the ferry system design allowed for a one-time, 15 percent increase in Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW), the weight of the airplane at the time of the accident was estimated to be about 23 percent beyond the standard MTOW. Additionally, an estimate of the airplane\u2019s center of gravity position at the time of the accident revealed that it was about 0.8 inches beyond the aft center-of-gravity limit. No weight and balance sheet referring to the airplane in the ferry flight configuration was located.It is likely that the aft loading resulted in the airplane encountering longitudinal instability during the initial left turn and entering a series of altitude and pitch oscillations, which would have been extremely difficult for the pilot to control. Also, the unsecured fuel tank and baggage could have moved during takeoff or after the oscillations began, shifting the center-of-gravity farther aft and exacerbating the longitudinal instability.The previous owner of the airplane reported that he had experienced autopilot anomalies, with symptoms similar to those observed during the airplane's divergence from controlled flight. However, the autopilot had been repaired about 8 months before the accident, and postaccident examination of the autopilot components revealed no evidence of any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.  Additionally, it is unlikely, given the overweight condition of the airplane, that the pilot would have been utilizing it during takeoff.  The stabilizer pitch trim control system was found near the full nose-up position, a position that, given the airplane\u2019s aft center-of-gravity, would have made pitch control more difficult to maintain. This position could indicate that the pilot may have been utilizing pitch trim in an effort to assist with regaining flight control after the oscillations began. The autopilot trim failure warning light was illuminated at the time of ground impact, indicating that one of the following conditions existed: the electric trim master switch was not on, the autopilot system had not been preflight tested, an autotrim failure had occurred, or an electric trim fault was detected.  If the electric trim master switch was not on, the manual trim system would still have been functional. If the autopilot system had not been preflight tested, the electric and manual trim systems would still have been functional. An autotrim failure would only be significant if the autopilot was engaged, and, as previously discussed, it is unlikely that the pilot was utilizing the autopilot. If the illumination was due to an electric trim fault, the pilot could have opposed any uncommanded movement of the trim with elevator or manual trim input. Additionally, it is unlikely that a runaway trim condition existed, because the trim was not found at either of its end stops. Although the specific condition that resulted in illumination of the warning light could not be determined, none of the possible conditions would have precluded the pilot from maintaining pitch control.

Examination of the airplane revealed that the left engine's fan spinner was completely missing, and the forward fan blade retainer was missing a 90-degree section of the bolt flange.  Several pieces of the fan spinner were recovered within the cowl.  The NTSB's examination of the fan blade forward retaining ring revealed features indicative of overstress failure which originated on the forward face adjacent to a linear impression.  The length and location of the linear impression corresponded to the corner on one of the bolt lugs on the aft side of the spinner. The linear impression contained evidence of fretting damage.  The inside radius between the retaining ring's raised lip, and the flange was within the range specified by the manufacturer.  The spinner's bolt lugs had a sharp outside corner where the spinner would interface with the radius on the retaining ring.  The forging drawing for this part did not specify a radius; however, a manufacturer's representative indicated that an engineering drawing for the spinner specified that exterior corners have an edge break with a radius between 0.005 and 0.020 inches.  The combination of the radius on the retaining ring, and the sharp edge on the aft side of the spinner, resulted in an interference when the parts were assembled. The manufacturer's examination of the retained parts indicated the presence of high cycle fatigue on both the spinner and the fan blade retaining ring.  Three dimensional finite element analysis of the fan spinner, and forward fan blade retaining ring predicted a reduced low cycle fatigue life.

It was not known if the accident pilots were attempting formation flight or were in communication with each other. However, 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 91.111(a) states that \"no person may operate an aircraft so close to another aircraft as to create a collision hazard.\" In addition, 14 CFR 91.113 stipulates that the pilot of an overtaking airplane (in this case, the PA24) \u201cshall alter course...to pass well clear\u201d of the overtaken airplane. The PA24 should not have passed over, under, or ahead of the PA28 unless it was well clear.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the PA24 pilot to maintain adequate clearance from the PA28 resulting in an inflight collision. Contributing to the accident was the PA24 pilot's decision to overtake the PA28."

The airline transport rated pilot and passenger were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, destined for a private airport in Kingston, New Hampshire.According to witness statements and video images, the takeoff occurred on runway 02 which was a 2,100 foot long by 170 foot wide turf covered runway. Comparison of the video footage to known landmarks on the airport indicated that after a ground run of approximately 890 feet the airplane lifted off, and the airplane angle of attack began to increase. Approximately 320 feet later its angle of attack was still increasing though its altitude was higher than a group of trees that were approximately 75 feet high located adjacent to the west side of the runway. Moments later the airplane rolled and yawed to the left, the angle of attack decreased through a level flight attitude, to a steep nose down attitude, and the airplane went out of view behind some trees. The sound of impact was then heard. Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane struck trees in a nose low, left wing down attitude, and then impacted the ground in a 42 degree nose low attitude, on an approximate magnetic heading of 220 degrees, before coming to rest. The smell of fuel was present, and multiple branches and broken tree limbs displayed evidence of propeller strike marks.Examination of the airplane and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction of the airplane or engine.The fuselage was broken and bent in several places. The wings displayed crush and compression damage, were detached from their mounting locations, and approximately two feet of the outboard left wing was separated.Flight control continuity was established from the flight controls to the cockpit, and the throttle control, mixture control, propeller control, and carburetor heat, were full in. The flap handle was in the 10-degree detent. The pilot seats' tracks showed evidence of pullout and cracking which was indicative of the pilot seats being in the locked position during the impact.The propeller displayed evidence of S-bending and chordwise scratching. Drivetrain continuity was established from the front of the engine to the accessory pad on the back of the engine, and oil was present in the galleries and rocker boxes. Both magnetos produced spark and the upper spark plug electrodes appeared normal and light gray in color. Thumb compression was established on all cylinders, and fuel was present in the carburetor float bowl. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rating for airplane multi engine land, with commercial privileges for airplane single-engine land, airplane single-engine sea, and type ratings for the B-707, B-720, and B-727. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on April 11, 2013. According to FAA and airplane maintenance records, the accident airplane was manufactured in 1956. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on June 6, 2014. At the time of the inspection, the airplane had accrued approximately 3,225 total hours of operation.",

The flight continued towards the destination airport and encountered lesser intensity reflectivity.  An individual at the destination airport reported hearing an occupant of the airplane ask, \"...for an advisory for the field\", and \"...what the weather was like.\"  The individual at the airport advised that the winds appeared to be in favor for runway 16, which was left hand traffic, the runway was wet, and the rain seemed to be letting up.

A pilot-rated witness located north of the destination airport, and nearly due west of the accident site reported seeing the airplane on what he thought was final approach to runway 16, but the airplane was \"very low.\"  The witness reported the airplane made a, \"sudden, sharp turn to the left [flying eastbound].\"  He then lost sight of the airplane and proceeded to the accident site.  Another pilot-rated witness who was located in a vehicle approximately 1/4 mile west-northwest of the accident site reported observing an airplane flying from the northwest.

Examination of the flight controls, both engines, propellers, and propeller governors revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction. Accessories of both engines including the magnetos were destroyed by the postcrash fire.  Additionally, both servo fuel injectors were heat damaged which precluded bench testing.

With a loud knock, the engine lost power and oil began to spray on the windshield.  The aircraft collided with ground obstructions during a forced landing attempt on a road.  Disassembly of the engine revealed only trace amounts of oil in the case, with a typical oil starvation heat distress failure of the numbers 3 and 4 connecting rods.  During removal of the propeller governor only a MS9144-01 screen gasket was installed between the governor and the mounting pad.  An oil path was observed running between the gasket and the pad from the high pressure oil port to the outside edge of the pad.  Review of Lycoming publications (published in 1987) revealed that this particular engine requires a unique gasket and plate stack to prevent oil leakage between the governor and it's mounting pad.  The maintenance records disclosed that 1.4 hours prior to the accident, the propeller governor was removed for repair then reinstalled on the engine.  Both the mechanic who performed the work and the IA who inspected the job stated that the current Cessna 177 maintenance and parts manuals were used for procedural guidance.  Both said they were unaware of a special gasket stack requirement for this particular engine, and they would not routinely refer to engine manuals for a governor installation since the governor is an airframe component.  The Cessna service manual only speaks to the installation of the MS screen gasket, and uses the term 'gasket' in the singular form.  The special Lycoming gasket and plate are not mentioned in either Cessna manual.

After landing, the pilot made numerous attempts to locate fuel in order to continue the flight so that his passenger could be at work in the morning. The pilot left a note and money after having siphoned fuel from another airplane parked at the airport.  After about 2 hours and 45 minutes on the ground, the airplane took off again.  Impact marks indicate that the airplane stalled during the takeoff, impacting the terrain with the left wing prior to catching fire and coming to rest inverted.

He then departed his home airfield, to pick up a passenger at another airfield approximately 17 nautical miles away  The pilot then departed for another airfield located about 76 nautical miles away; no problems were noted during these flights.  However, ten minutes after departing his last airfield, the engine experienced a loss of RPM.  The pilot ran the emergency checklist and searched for a place to land as the airplane was unable to maintain altitude.  The airplane had experienced several loss of engine power events before, but each time the pilot was able to make a safe landing.  The first time was shortly after being sold to  a new buyer; an inspection of the airplane's fuel tanks, revealed contamination in the form of \"beads\" in the fuel tank.   Shortly after having the tanks flushed, the second loss of power event happened, (after each event, and after the airplane had landed the engine would produce power again).  The carburetor was examined and the airplane returned to service.  Approximately 15-30 hours later, another loss of power event happened.  This time the carburetor was sent to a repair facility, which rebuilt the carburetor and told the owner that a \"wrong jet\" had been installed in the carburetor.  The airplane then flew another 50-60 hours without a re-occurrence.  The airplane's original fuel caps were replaced, sometime prior to the accident.  The fuel caps installed on the airplane were an aftermarket design, with the label \"2646V\" inked on the top of the caps.

The VOR approach procedure included an inbound course to the VOR, and after passage, a descent along the same course to a missed approach point. The missed approach point was defined as 6 nautical miles beyond the VOR, as well as by timing. The pilot twice attempted the VOR approach in instrument meteorological conditions. He flew the first approach to the missed approach point, initiated a missed approach, contacted the controller, and requested a second VOR approach. He then received vectors to rejoin the approach course inbound to the VOR. The airplane subsequently passed over the VOR, on course, about 100 feet above the minimum altitude. However, instead of descending as described in the procedure, the airplane maintained that altitude until reaching the airport, then began a descent. The airplane continued to travel outbound along the same approach course until it impacted rising terrain about 6.5 miles beyond the airport. There was no dedicated distance measuring equipment (DME) onboard the airplane. Instead, distance was determined by the use of an instrument flight rules (IFR)-approved GPS unit.

The pilot could have selected the airport as a \"direct to\" waypoint, or, if he had entered flight plan waypoints, the unit would have sequenced from the VOR to the airport during the first approach. In either case, unless the pilot reprogrammed the unit, the last waypoint entered would have remained at the airport, rather than the VOR. The pilot then most likely mistook the airport position for the VOR position, and displaced the beginning of the descent by 6 nautical miles. Also noted, was that once the airplane passed over the VOR en route to the airport, the HSI would have indicated a change of \"to\" to \"from\". There were no medical anomalies noted with the pilot and no mechanical anomalies noted with the airplane.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's misinterpretation of the airplane's position relative to the final approach fix, which resulted in the displacement of the descent profile by 6 nautical miles and the subsequent controlled flight into rising terrain.   Contributing to the accident were the low clouds."

The panel fell forward and down, striking the captain on the head.  The captain received a 1-inch cut on his head.  The first officer requested and received clearance for an immediate descent and landing at Denver, Colorado.  An examination of the flight deck door showed the correct placard in place; however, the door was not in compliance with the manufacturer's issued Service Bulletin (SB), B231001-52-02 for the Boeing model 757-200 flight deck door.  On further examination, the doorstop mechanism, mounted on the bottom of the flight deck door, was found to be loose and missing one attachment screw.  According to an FAA inspector, this misalignment would cause the door to \"hang and catch\" the floor, requiring added force to close the door.  The SB instructed that modified pressure relief latches and latch spacers be installed on the upper and lower decompression panels on flight deck doors, and latch straps be installed on upper panels.  The airline company and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were aware of previous problems with the flight deck door latches. The NTSB issued an urgent safety recommendation letter requesting the FAA issue an Airworthiness Directive that required compliance with the SB within 90 days.  The FAA subsequently issued the appropriate AD.",

On seeing the oil, he contacted air traffic control, declared an emergency, and began a standard rate, 180-degree turn, back to the airport.  As he completed the turn, he heard a \"boom,\" felt a shutter, and then the windscreen was covered with oil.  The pilot said he may have noted a pitch up with the bang, but he immediately got on the best glide speed, 90 knots, and began retracing his ground track via the global positioning system (GPS) back to the airport.  The airplane landed uneventfully back to the airport.  An examination of the airplane showed minor damage to the front of the cowling, and the engine showed the crankshaft fractured aft of the flange.  The propeller and spinner, and the forward part of the crankshaft were missing.  Several months after the incident, the separated propeller assembly and crankshaft were located.  Examination of the engine revealed the crankshaft was fractured through, aft of the propeller flange.  The fracture of the crankshaft was caused by a fatigue crack that stemmed from the aft relief radius of the propeller flange.  The surface of the aft radius contained no evidence of mechanical damage and the fatigue crack emanated from multiple origins over a wide area, indicating that a great amount of stress was necessary to initiate the fatigue crack.  The reason for the crack initiation could not be determined.  The fatigue crack origin area was located in the relief radius in line with the axis of the propeller blades, consistent with forward and aft bending stresses imposed by the blades during flight.  The location indicates a possibility that the blades were out of balance while rotating or that the crankshaft was somehow damaged in the past.  No evidence of fretting was noted between the faces of the crankshaft propeller flange and the alternator pulley.  The propeller assembly was attached firmly to the crankshaft.",

The experimental, amateur-built (E-AB) airplane then continued on a westerly heading until the GPS stopped recording data. The last recorded radar return with altitude information was at 4,300 feet. Before the last radar return, the airplane was in a slight descent and had accelerated to about 100 to 110 knots ground speed. Witnesses reported that the engine stopped running in flight, and the tail separated before the airplane collided with the ground. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the airplane\u2019s fuel system was empty and the propeller showed no evidence of rotation at impact. The airplane\u2019s \u201cY-tail,\u201d which was essentially the same as a V-tail, was found about 550 feet from the main wreckage, which confirmed that the airplane broke up in flight. The breakup appeared to have initiated in the forward Y-tail attachment structure, which was an aluminum attach angle. The lower attach angle separated in tension along the right side and further separated with the fracture running from the right to the left. When the lower attach angle broke, the structure that formed the aft connection Y-fitting also fractured and separated. Due to a lack of GPS data and the typical sample rate of radar data, the exact circumstances, including precise airspeed and any maneuvering leading up to the breakup, are not known. It is likely that the pilot, distracted by the loss of engine power, allowed the airplane to enter an unusual attitude, and the tail separated during the pilot\u2019s attempted recovery from the unusual attitude.Although there were (and are) no required design standards or criteria for E-AB airplanes, the kit designer used a pre-1996 version of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 23, Appendix A, when he designed the airframe. The pre-1996 version stated that the design load criteria in the appendix were an approved equivalent for the certification of conventional, single-engine airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight. The 1996 revision of Appendix A removed the reference to conventional airplane and added an expanded section defining the applicability of Appendix A. The expanded definition explicitly excluded using Appendix A criteria when designing the V-tail configurations of certified airplanes. In general, the surface loads on a V-tail configuration may be greater than the design loads expected on the surfaces of a conventional tail airplane.

The jumpers estimated the trees in the area were a maximum of 120 feet tall, and therefore, they requested a 150 foot long line be used for the equipment drop.  The helicopter was dispatched with a tandem load on a 160 foot long line.  The smoke jumpers placed a marker on a sand bar in a stream bed.  There was a tall dead tree (snag) located on a cut bank overlooking the sand bar.  As the helicopter approached the area, one of the smoke jumpers communicated by radio with the pilot that if he did not like the marked site, he could choose his own spot.   The pilot replied that he would give the marked spot a try.  The radio operator did not mention the snag to the pilot.  The pilot successfully placed both loads on the marker.  Another smoke jumper disconnected both loads and then reconnected one of the loads meant to be dropped at another location.  As the helicopter began its departure, the pilot who was sitting in the left seat, slowly turned the helicopter's nose to the left and its tail to the right.  This maneuver allowed the helicopter's tail rotor to contact the snag.  The helicopter began to spin and then fell to the ground.  Investigation revealed that the snag was located 36 feet from the marker and was about 173 feet tall.  The rotor diameter of the helicopter was 48 feet.   Following the accident, the USFS issued an Aviation Safety Alert on the subject of \"Clearance From Obstacles During External Load Operations.\"  One of the recommendations in the alert stated the following:  \"In areas of sloping terrain or with obstacles rising to one or more sides of the cargo pickup/delivery area, or dip site, pilot should maintain aircraft clearance from all obstacles in accordance with the landing area safety circle requirements for the type aircraft.

About 18 minutes before the accident, the passenger stated to the pilot \"boy those catfish are going crazy down there aren't they\". The pilot respond \"yep\", \"must have been the vibrations from the helicopter\". About 2 minutes later the passenger and pilot discuss sighting deer in a field. About 1 minute 30 seconds before the accident, the pilot asked the passenger \"has this vertical just gotten in here or has it been here for a while?\" The passenger replied \"we haven't had any verticals at all.\" The pilot replied, \"we do now.\" The passenger replied, \"yeah well it started right after we left back there. I think it maybe ah that's why I was thinking it was the air.\" About 20 seconds later, the passenger stated that another person had tracked the helicopter's blades before they left and that he was commenting on how smooth it was. About 40 seconds later the pilot stated \"this stuff is getting worse.\" The recording then ended. Witnesses in the area of the accident site stated that they observed the helicopter flying from east to west, just above the treetops. The helicopter began rolling back and forth. They then observed the main rotor blades contact the tail area, and the aft tail boom and tail rotor separate. Shortly after this, the main rotor separated and the helicopter descended and crashed to the ground.  A fire erupted during ground impact. Witnesses did not observe any smoke come from the helicopter prior to the accident. The entire main rotor system was accounted for in the wreckage, except for the pitch change horn for the \"red\" main rotor blade and the majority of the pitch change link that attaches to the \"red\" pitch change horn at the pitch change links lower rod end. The \"red\" grip remained in place in the main rotor system.  The surface of the \"red\" grip exhibited two boreholes that mated with two bushing that were part of the departed and missing \"red\" pitch change horn.  The mating grip surface exhibited a blackish residue near the pitch change horn boreholes, and the blackish area extended beyond the boreholes. The crashsite and an extended area back-up the wreckage path were searched extensively, including by Boy Scout parties; the \"red\" pitch change horn and most of the \"red\" pitch change link were not found. Examination of the red grip by an NTSB metallurgist showed the surfaces of both the upper and lower holes showed extensive areas of dark deposits and surface damage consistent with repeated small relative movements against mating objects  (fretting).  Visible fretting areas covered most of the surface of the bushing counter bores and portions of the fractured surfaces of the threads. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis of samples of the black deposits taken from the upper hole found them to mostly contain aluminum and iron and significant amounts of oxygen along with minor amounts for the other constituents of the grip and bushing. Samples from the lower hole were found to be mostly aluminum with large peaks for iron, cadmium, silicon and oxygen.  Both bushing counter bores showed localized material removal and enlargement of the diameters. Up to  .020 to 0.025 inches of material were removed in localized areas from the bushing bore. In addition, the bores were deformed and distorted adjacent to the grip surface. The surfaces of the holes, particularly the upper one, also contained circumferential marks in the bushing counter bore, the lock ring diameter and on the fractured threads indicating progressive and incremental movement of the mating objects. No other evidence of failure or malfunction of the helicopter structure, flight controls, engine, or rotor and rotor drive system was found.

Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to respond to increased vibration in the main rotor system and land immediately."

During the maneuver, the airplane impacted a berm in desert terrain when the CFI attempted to terminate the demonstration at too low an altitude.  The CFI initiated the instructional lesson about 3,500 feet above ground level by directing the second pilot, who had about 80 hours of total flying experience, to close the engine's throttle.  The pilot complied with the CFI's instructions.  The engine's throttle was cleared several times during the descent, and the engine's speed increased without incident.  Upon descending between 400 and 500 feet agl, full engine power was applied to terminate the simulation.  However, immediately after the second pilot applied engine power, the CFI fully retarded the engine's throttle, indicated that he desired to continue the descent to within 20 feet of the ground, and took the airplane's controls.  When the airplane was approximately 15 to 20 feet agl, the CFI increased engine power.  There was a momentary delay before the engine's power was reacquired during which the CFI banked the airplane to the left.  During the turn, the airplane's left wing, nose gear, and fuselage impacted the ground hard.

The parachute deployed, and, within seconds, the airplane settled into trees about 2 miles from the airport. The airplane remained suspended in the trees until emergency personnel arrived on scene and rescued the occupants.After the accident, the presence of oil was noted on the underside of the airplane. After the airplane was recovered from the trees, examination of the oil dipstick revealed small pieces of metal in the engine oil. Examination of the engine revealed that the crankshaft was fractured and that the crankcase exhibited varying degrees of fretting and lock-slot elongation on the main bearing supports, which is consistent with the application of insufficient torque on the cylinder through-bolts by maintenance personnel. New cylinders had been installed on the engine 113 hours before the accident. Because the cylinders were loose, the oil supply at the No. 2 main journal was shut off and the crankshaft broke, which resulted in the subsequent loss of oil pressure to the engine.",

He then asked the student pilot what he would do to recover the airplane. The student pilot lowered the nose of the airplane and maintained controlled flight. As the airplane descended, the DPE asked the student pilot to turn the fuel boost pump to the \"ON\" position and recover the airplane. The student pilot acknowledged but did not activate the boost pump and the airplane continued to descend. The DPE took over control of the airplane and pushed the throttle forward to regain engine power. However, the engine did not regain full power and the DPE made a forced landing into trees. During the forced landing, both wings collided with trees and the airplane came to rest at the base of a tree. The airplane was recovered for further examination, and it was determined that an engine run could be performed. The engine was started and ran at idle power.

Both aircraft were operating as scheduled passenger flights under 14 CFR part 121 and were operating on instrument flight plans.  There were no reported injuries to occupants and no reported damage to either aircraft.  SKW5741 was arriving at SFO after a flight from Modesto, California.  The aircraft was cleared for a visual approach by Northern California Terminal Radar Approach Control (NCT) and transferred to SFO tower.  The crew contacted the SFO local controller at 1332:29, reporting that they were six miles out on the BRIJJ visual approach.  The local controller acknowledged, issued a wake turbulence advisory for a Boeing 757 landing on runway 28L, and cleared SKW5741 to land on runway 28R.  According to NCT radar data, the aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 1335:13.  RPA4912 (radio callsign \"Brickyard 4912\"), taxied to runway 1L and was instructed to taxi onto the runway to hold at 1333:36.  RPA4912 was cleared for takeoff at 1335:12.  The crew acknowledged.At 1335:40, during a transmission to an uninvolved aircraft by the local controller, an aural AMASS warning is audible in the background.  At 1335:44, the local controller begins attempting to instruct SKW5741 to stop, transmitting, \"uh, Skywest HOLD HOLD HOLD\".According to controllers' written statements, SKW5741 came to a stop in the intersection of runways 1L and 28R.  RPA4912 lifted off and overflew SKW5741.  The initial FAA tower report estimated the aircraft missed colliding by 300 feet.  However, the Skywest crew estimated the distance as 30 to 50 feet and the crew of RPA4912 estimated 150 feet.  They characterized their estimate as a \"guess,\" noting that they could not actually see the Brasilia as they passed over the top of the aircraft.SFO ATCT is equipped with an Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) that uses radar to track aircraft on and near the airport surface, providing conflict detection and aircraft location information to controllers.  The system is able to detect conflicts between aircraft using the same runway, and, following a software modification that was installed on February 17, 2007, the system is also able to detect conflicts between aircraft using intersecting runways. SKW5741's approach was tracked by NCT's ASR-9 terminal radar system located at Oakland International Airport, approximately 8 miles north of SFO.  The Oakland radar system does not provide surface coverage at SFO, but it did detect RPA4912 climbing off the airport immediately after the incident.  Comparison of the NCT radar time with the AMASS radar time indicated that the AMASS clock was about 15 to 16 seconds fast in relation to the NCT clock.  The NCT clock is set and checked every shift, but the AMASS clock time is derived from the internal clock of the computer running AMASS and is more subject to error.  Therefore, this report will consider the ARTS clock as authoritative and AMASS times will be corrected accordingly.The AMASS system recorded data for both RPA4912 and SKW5741, detecting the conflict and alerting controllers at 1335:40.  The AMASS targets for the two aircraft merged in the runway intersection at 1335:55.  RPA1912 first appears on the OAK ASR-9 just south of taxiway V at 1335:59, climbing through 200 feet.",

All systems and controls were found to be operating normally.  The pilot took off on a southeast heading and established a climb at a rate of 500 feet per minute.  Somewhere between 300 and 400 feet, the pilot initiated a left turn to a northerly heading.  At that time the pilot experienced an uncommanded cyclic movement to the right-forward quadrant and the collective started to come up (increase).  The pilot added that the nose of the helicopter pitched-up and the helicopter started to roll to the left.  The pilot stated that he concluded that he had experienced \"a hydraulic failure of some kind,\" so as per the emergency procedures, he turned the hydraulic control switch on the collective lever to the \"off\" position.  The pilot added that the hydraulic light on the console was activated indicating that the hydraulics were \"off.\" The action taken by the pilot were not effective and the pilot was not able to regain control of the helicopter.  The helicopter continued rolling to the left and entered a spin to the left while the helicopter remained in a nose low attitude.

Both airplanes impacted the ocean in the area of the collision.  Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed, with no visibility restrictions.  Review of the recorded radar data showed the Citabria as a primary target with no mode C altitude reporting.  The Thorp was identified as a secondary 1200 VFR beacon code with mode C altitude reporting.  The Citabria's target radar track showed it flying south over the coastal hills until it intersected with the shoreline.  At the shoreline, the Citabria's target passed in front of the Thorp's radar target and continued southbound until it was about 0.75 nautical miles (nm) offshore.  The Citabria's radar target then turned left 180 degrees, heading back toward the north.  The Thorp target flew along the coastline until about 8 nm northwest of the accident site.  The target made a right 180-degree turn, and started to track back along the coastline.  About 2 nm northwest of the collision point, the target's mode C reported an altitude of 2,400 feet msl.  The target's mode C altitude radar return continued to increase in altitude until the radar track stopped.  At this time, the separation between the two targets was about 0.5 nm.  The radar track shows the Thorp's target continued eastbound along the coast in a slight climb, and the Citabria's target continued northbound until radar contact with the Thorp was lost at 1729:37, at an altitude of 2,900 feet msl.  The radar target on the Citabria was lost at 1730:10.  The radar tracks of both aircraft were approximately perpendicular in the last minutes of flight.  Both aircraft impacted the water after the midair collision.  The Citabria washed ashore on the beach.  The Thorp impacted the water about 150 yards east of the Citabria and sank in about 20 feet of water.  Both airplanes were destroyed during the collision and impact sequence with the water, and further damaged by tidal action prior to and during the recovery process.  All flight control components and control surfaces for the Citabria were accounted for in the recovered wreckage.  The left wing strut, which was white in color, was missing and not recovered from the ocean.  An examination of the Citabria wreckage for paint transfer marks from the Thorp met with negative results.  Examination of the Thorp was inhibited due to the damage to the airplane wreckage by the post accident impact with the ocean and the subsequent tidal action prior to and during the recovery process.

Despite the tailwind, the captain elected to land on the 6,600-foot-long runway instead of circling to land with a headwind. Moderate to heavy rain had been falling for the past hour, and the runway was wet. The crew said that the airplane was flown at the prescribed airspeed (Vref) for its weight with the wing flaps fully extended on final approach, and that they touched down just beyond the touchdown zone. The captain said that he extended the wings' spoilers immediately after touchdown. He tested the brakes and noted normal brake pedal pressure. However, during rollout, he noted a lack of deceleration and applied more brake pressure, with no discernible deceleration. The airplane's optional thrust reversers had been previously rendered non-operational by company maintenance personnel and were therefore not functional. The captain stated that he thought about performing a go-around but believed that insufficient runway remained to ensure a safe takeoff. While trying to stop, he did not activate the emergency brakes (which would have bypassed the anti-skid system) because he thought that there was insufficient time, and he was preoccupied with maintaining control of the airplane. He asked the first officer to apply braking with him, and together the crew continued applying brake pedal pressure; however, when the airplane was about 2,000 feet from the runway's end, it was still traveling about 100 knots. As the airplane rolled off the departure end on runway 30, which was wet, both pilots estimated that the airplane was still travelling between 85 and 90 knots. The airplane traveled 618 feet through a rain-soaked grassy runway safety area before encountering a drainage swale that collapsed the nose gear. As the airplane was traversing the soft, wet field, its wheels partially sank into the ground. While decelerating, soil impacted the landing gear wheels and struts where wiring to the antiskid brake system was located. The crew said that there were no indications on any cockpit annunciator light of a system failure or malfunction; however, after the airplane came to a stop they observed that the annunciator light associated with the antiskid system for the No. 2 wheel was illuminated (indicating a system failure). The other three annunciator lights (one for each wheel) were not illuminated.During the approach, the first officer had completed the landing data card by using a company-developed quick reference card. The quick reference card\u2019s chart, which contained some data consistent with the landing charts in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), did not have correction factors for tailwind conditions, whereas the charts in the AFM do contain corrective factors for tailwind conditions. The landing data prepared by the first officer indicated that 3,240 feet was required to stop the airplane on a dry runway in zero wind conditions, with a wet correction factor increasing stopping distance to 4,538 feet. The Vref speed was listed as 127 knots for their landing weight of 11,000 pounds, and the first officer\u2019s verbal and written statements noted that they crossed the runway threshold at 125 knots. During the investigation, Bombardier Lear calculated the wet stopping distances with an 8-knot tailwind as 5,110 feet.The touchdown zone for runway 30 is 1,000 feet from the approach end. The crew\u2019s estimate of their touchdown location on the runway is about 1,200 feet from the approach end, yielding a remaining runway of 5,400 feet. On-duty controllers in the tower watched the landing and said that the airplane touched down in front of the tower at a taxiway intersection that is 1,881 feet from the approach end, which would leave about 4,520 feet of runway to stop the airplane. The controllers observed water spraying off the airplane\u2019s main landing gear just after touchdown.Postaccident testing indicated that the brake system, including the brake wear, was within limits, with no anomalies found. No evidence of tire failure was noted. The antiskid system was removed from the airplane for functional tests. The control box and the left and right control valves tested within specifications. The four wheel speed sensors met the electrical resistance specification. For units 1, 2 and 3, the output voltages exceeded the minimum specified voltages for each of the listed frequencies. Unit 4 was frozen and could not be rotated and thus could not be tested. Sensors 1 and 2 exceeded the specified 15% maximum to minimum voltage variation limit. Sensor 3 was within the limit and 4 could not be tested.Based on all the evidence, it is likely that the airplane touched down on the water-contaminated runway beyond the touchdown zone, at a point with about 600 feet less remaining runway than the performance charts indicated that the airplane required for the wet conditions. Since a reverted rubber hydroplaning condition typically follows an encounter with dynamic hydroplaning, the reverted rubber signatures on the No. 2 tire indicate that the airplane encountered dynamic hydroplaning shortly after touchdown, and the left main gear wheel speed sensor anomalies allowed the left tires to progress to reverted rubber hydroplaning. This, along with postaccident testing, indicates that the anti-skid system was not performing optimally and, in concert with the hydroplaning conditions, significantly contributed to the lack of deceleration during the braking attempts.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the flight crew to stop the airplane on the runway due to the flying pilot\u2019s failure to attain the proper touchdown point. Contributing to the accident was an anti-skid system that was not performing optimally, which allowed the airplane to encounter reverted rubber hydroplaning, and the company-developed quick reference landing distance chart that did not provide correction factors related to tailwind conditions."

He elected to land at a nearby grass runway and the airplane touched down about 1,800 feet down the 3,700 foot runway.  During the landing roll the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane veered off the right side of the runway.  Shortly after the accident the master switch was turned on and power was available to raise and lower the flaps.  Additionally, during repair of the airplane following the accident no maintenance was performed or required to the electrical system or to the right main landing gear assembly.  According to the emergency procedures section of the airplane information manual, the emergency hand pump is to be pumped until resistance is heavy-about 35 cycles. ",
