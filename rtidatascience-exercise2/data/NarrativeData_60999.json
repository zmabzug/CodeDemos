At 5 miles out from Sanford he decreased airspeed to 80 miles per hour, lowered the flaps, trimmed the airplane and flew the ILS approach to runway 27R, but does not recall using carburetor heat.  He had the runway insight at 1/3 miles and with an altitude of 200 feet, he says the engine sputtered several times and then lost power.  He switched to the right fuel tank with no response.  He advised ATC that the engine was out and he was going to land short of runway 27R.  He continued to control the airplane until the airplane hit a treetop that spun the airplane 180 degrees clockwise.  The airplane came to rest on its landing gear between a row of trees.  The passenger and himself exited the airplane, and immediately found rescue crews on-scene.  An employee from the engine manufacturer of the accident airplane, who assisted the FAA during the postaccident investigation observed the fuel system was compromised, but a residual amount of fuel was found in the fuel supply lines to the engine.  The fuel gasolator was checked and found clean.  The fuel system lines were disconnected and contained clean blue aviation fuel.  The inlet screen to the carburetor was clean.  The fuel pump produced fuel flow when the engine was rotated.  No stains were observed to indicate leaks from the engine.  Further examination of the engine revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have prevented the engine from developing power prior to the accident.  The responding FAA accident inspector stated the airplane incurred substantial damage when it collided with trees when it landed short of runway 27R.  The engine inspection conducted by the engine manufacturer revealed no problems to be associated with the engine.  A weather report from the National Whether Service Office showed conditions around the Sanford area at the time of the accident to be conducive to carburetor icing.  The pilot stated he did not turn on the carburetor heat during the landing approach.  ",

During initial climb after takeoff, the certified flight instructor (CFI) reported to the tower controller that the airplane had experienced an engine failure and that they needed to return to the runway. The controller cleared the flight to land on any runway, but the airplane subsequently banked left and impacted the ground in a nose-down attitude. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the propeller for the engine that lost power (the left engine) was not in the feathered position and that the landing gear was in the extended position, which is contrary to the published emergency procedure for an engine failure during takeoff. Postaccident download of avionics data revealed that the left engine lost fuel flow and rpm less than 1 minute after takeoff power was applied, and examination of the wreckage revealed that the left fuel selector lever and fuel selector valve were found in the off position. The taxiing checklist for the airplane specified that the fuel selectors were to be switched from the on position to the crossfeed position to ensure that the crossfeeds were working properly; the before takeoff checklist specified that the fuel selectors should be set to the on position. Postaccident ground testing performed in an airplane of the same model as the accident airplane revealed that, when the fuel selectors are moved from the crossfeed position to the on position (or from the on position to the crossfeed position), the fuel selector passes through the off position. The ground testing also showed that, when the test airplane\u2019s left fuel selector was placed in the off position and then takeoff power was applied to both engines, the left engine lost power completely after 36 seconds.

Extreme forward yoke pressure (the pilot estimated between 100 and 150 pounds force) was required to keep the airplane from pitching up and stalling, so the pilot kept both hands on the yoke. The Airplane Flight Manual contains emergency procedures for use in the event of an autopilot out-of-trim event; the third item on the checklist directs pilots to re-trim the pitch, if necessary, using the trim wheel. The pilot noted that he did not attempt to use the manual trim wheel to change the airplane\u2019s pitch attitude because that would have required him to release hand pressure on the control yoke. He was uncertain when or how the autopilot was disengaged. He declared an emergency and made a spiraling descent to lose altitude. He reported that he encountered multiple violent pitch up and down oscillations near the bottom of the descent; the pilot\u2019s seat was broken during one of the oscillations, which allowed the pilot to use his knees to apply forward yoke pressure.

Examination of the removed fuel pump indicated that the main drive shaft splines and the internal drive gear splines were worn to the point of no spline engagement, which resulted in a loss of fuel pump flow. The engine manufacturer, Rolls-Royce (formerly Allison), issued commercial engine bulletin (CEB) A-1352 on August 21, 1997, which recommended inspection of the fuel pump splines at 100-hour intervals, beginning within 25 hours of receipt of the bulletin. The 100-hour interval spline inspections were an interim safeguard while product improvements were developed and validated. On April 30, 1998, Rolls-Royce (Allison) issued CEB 1355, which recommended a fuel pump upgrade no later than March 31, 1999. Upon compliance with upgrade bulletin, the 100-hour spline inspections indicated by CEB A-1352 were no longer required. Although it was not possible to determine whether the 100-hour spline inspections recommended in CEB A-1352 had been accomplished, the model number of the accident helicopter\u2019s fuel pump indicated that the fuel pump upgrade recommended by CEB A-1355 had not been completed. If the fuel pump upgrade had been completed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s guidance, the accident helicopter\u2019s fuel pump would not have failed as it did.",
            "probable_cause": "Unknown personnel's failure to comply with the engine manufacturer's engine fuel pump replacement guidance, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to the engine fuel pump failure."

The flight crew discussed the situation and did not believe they had a landing gear malfunction, as they did not receive an Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) message. They decided to press the \"Downlock Release\" button to raise the gear, the landing gear subsequently retracted, and the flight continued to the destination airport area uneventfully. As the flight crew attempted to extend the landing gear for landing, the nose landing gear (NLG) did not extend. They prepared for an emergency landing, and touched down \"normally\" on the main landing gear. The airplane came to rest on the runway, and during the evacuation, one passenger was seriously injured. Three days prior to the accident, the airplane had its NLG strut serviced as part of its approved maintenance program. The following day, a pilot reported that the NLG was \"low\" and \"sounded like it was bottoming out.\" The NLG strut was checked by maintenance personnel, and found to be within limits. Additionally, during the day prior to the accident, a pilot reported that the landing gear did not retract after takeoff. Maintenance personnel believed the problem to be the landing gear control lever, and replaced it. Examination of the NLG, after the accident, revealed the NLG fluid volume was approximately two-fifths of what a normally serviced NLG should contain. Disassembly of the NLG revealed evidence of \"bottoming,\" or under-service operation. A review of the operator's maintenance job card titled \"Servicing NLG Shock Strut,\" revealed discrepancies when compared to the manufacturers Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM). The operator's maintenance job card did not contain a procedure to fill the shock strut with the final volume of hydraulic fluid. The accident airplane was equipped with Proximity Sensor Electronics Modules (PSEMs), which relayed the position of the landing gear to the EICAS. The model of PSEM, which was installed on the airplane, was not the most current model, and by design, would not generate an EICAS message (\"LG WOW SYS FAIL\") if the nose gear did not retract or extend.  Examination of the operator's \"Gear Lever Cannot Be Moved Up\" checklist revealed discrepancies when compared to the airplane manufacturer's checklist.  The operator's checklist began with the condition: \"LG WOW SYS FAIL message displayed,\" and the manufacturer's checklist did not. Since the crew did not receive a \"LG WOW SYS FAIL\" message, they did not have clear written guidance on what action to take when the landing gear handle could not be moved to the retracted position.",

Approximately 30 seconds later, the back seat canopy transparency failed and separated from the aircraft.  The back seat passenger's headset and hat accompanied the transparency fragments to the ground.  The airplane began oscillating divergently, pitching up to near vertical, turned right, and impacted the ground longitudinally oriented approximately 60 degrees to the right of the energy track alignment.  The airplane's most recent empty weight CG calculations indicate that the airplane was at 34.98% MAC; the factory recommends a 27.7% MAC empty weight CG.  The airplane's flight CG (with two occupants and the main fuel tank full) was calculated to be 29.58% MAC.  The manufacturer recommends an approximate flight CG of 23 to 25.5% MAC.  As the CG moves aft of this envelope, aircraft control becomes progressively more sensitive.  The manufacturer reported that their test pilot's have flown the airplane with CGs as high 34% to 35% MAC, and aircraft records indicate that the pilot had previous flight experience with CGs in the 29% to 30% MAC range.  Aircraft records also indicate that the pilot had 38.6 hours of flight experience in the airplane in approximately 3 years, and 6.6 hours of experience during the last 18 months.  The night before the accident, the pilot had returned from a trip around the world in his Boeing Business Jet, with multiple business stops along the way.

The pilot reported that, when the helicopter was about 1 mile north of the airport and near a group of high-powered transmission broadcast towers, the engine started running roughly and that he felt an uncommanded decrease in engine power and movement of the twist grip throttle. The pilot initiated an autorotation, and the helicopter landed hard, which resulted in substantial damage to the tailboom. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed no mechanical anomalies that could have precluded normal operation.According to a flight instructor based at the departure airport, he had encountered a similar uncommanded decrease in engine power on multiple occasions while flying east of the same broadcast towers in the same make and model helicopter. During each encounter, the pilot felt the movement of the electronic governor through the throttle twist grip and was able to override the governor by advancing the throttle. Further, Federal Aviation Administration research revealed that high-power broadcast AM radio transmitters likely affect the governor circuit on this helicopter and can result in governor control that reduces the engine speed regardless of the pilot\u2019s power input. Thus, it is likely that radio frequency interference increased the engine speed signal frequency as the pilot flew the helicopter near the transmission towers. The governor controller then engaged the governor motor to decrease engine power, which the pilot perceived as a loss of power.About 15 years before the accident, the manufacturer had issued a safety notice to address previous reports of radio interference. The safety notice stated that flying near broadcast towers may result in \u201cerratic operation of the governor,\u201d which may cause the governor to roll the throttle to the idle or open position. The notice also instructed pilots to keep one hand on the collective and throttle and to refrain from flying near broadcast towers. The pilot reported that he was familiar with the safety notice but that he had not read it since he purchased the helicopter about 7 years before the accident. The pilot should have been able to recognize that the engine was still producing power and overridden the governor by moving the twist grip throttle, and he should have been able to maintain rotor rpm while executing the autorotation, which would have resulted in a softer landing; however, he did not do so.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain rotor rpm during an autorotation after a perceived partial loss of power, which resulted in a hard landing.

The glider was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the glider, was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight. The tow pilot reported that takeoff was normal and shortly after beginning the climb, the pilot noticed a lightening of the control forces.  Subsequently, the pilot determined that the glider had separated from the tow line about 100 feet, above ground level.  Examination of the accident site by National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators revealed that the glider impacted terrain about 350 feet east of 28AZ. The glider was recovered to a secure storage facility for further examination.",

According to radar information, at 1113:33, YV395CP's altitude was about 23,600 feet, and at 1114:58 YV385CP had descended to 2,800 feet. Sound spectrum analysis of an FAA re-recording of communications between the pilot and ATC, indicated there were electronic signatures present, attributable to propeller noise, at cruise setting, for that type of aircraft. Records obtained from Venezuela indicated that earlier, YV385CP had been involved in an accident, and had incurred extensive structural damage. The aircraft had been repaired in Venezuela, and was subsequently flown to the Unites States for additional repairs. Records obtained from the U.S. repair station indicated that the airplane incurred an extensive maintenance history, with needed repairs including damaged wiring, and leaks in the fuel system, as well as structural leaks, which had lead to several pressurization difficulties.

The Puerto Rico Port Authority then moved the helicopter and cleaned up all of the scattered helicopter parts and debris prior to the arrival of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector and without any photo documentation of the wreckage. The FAA inspector subsequently took photographs of the wreckage that included the forward left cyclic servo control (push-pull) tube attachment point on the non-rotating swashplate. The control tube was not attached and the swashplate attachment ear had no corresponding attachment hardware. In addition, the control tube rod end was separated from the top of the tube in overload. A search of the wreckage and the crash site by the FAA inspector did not produce the rod end, nor did a subsequent court-ordered search. A detailed examination of the helicopter revealed that the interior bore of the left lateral servo attachment ear had multiple scoring and impact marks consistent with the dimensions and spacing of the attachment bolt threads. The marks also indicated that the rod end attachment bolt had been forcibly pivoted while backing out of the hole, which likely occurred because the retaining nut was missing. During the helicopter's most recent annual inspection the left lateral servo was removed and replaced; however, neither the inspection nor the replacement of the servo required disconnection of the upper servo control tube rod end from the swashplate attachment ear. The pilot's operating handbook required the pilot to ensure that the flight control rod ends were \"free without looseness,\" and that all fasteners were \"tight\" during preflight inspections. However, it is unknown whether the retaining nut was missing before the flight or if it came off in flight.",

The pilot stated that as he pushed sideways on the tail boom it seemed loose.  Subsequent examination by maintenance personnel found that the head half of the upper right 5/16-inch tail boom attach bolt was hanging loose by the safety wire.  Examination of the bolt revealed that it had failed about three threads from the bolt shank.  The remainder of the threaded portion of the bolt remained in the plate nut affixed to the fuselage.  Fretting was observed on the fuselage and tail boom mating points in proximity to the fractured bolt.  Areas of the bolt shank exhibited polishing.  Subsequent examination for collateral damage revealed cracks were present at the aluminum attach fitting and associated angles.  The operator examined two of their other 600N helicopters and found those with cracks at the same location.  Two other local area law enforcement operators also found cracks in the same location.  The tail boom is attached to the fuselage with four special OEM produced bolts.  The helicopter tail boom is required to be removed every 300 flight hours for inspection, and, in addition is occasionally removed for other servicing procedures.  Examination of the maintenance records disclosed that the bolts may have been through about 10 torque cycles.  The bolts have no life limit.  The failed 5/16-inch bolt, p/n HS5482-5-18, is torqued to 150-inch/pounds during installation.

The fatigue cracks initiated along the thread roots of the bolts; these cracks were generally positioned about 180 degrees from each other, and were consistent with failure from reverse bending fatigue. After the bolts fractured, the bevel gear was unconstrained, leading to overstress fracture of the adjacent components. The fracture surface of the main rotor shaft was analyzed; the fracture surface was orientated 45 degrees from the longitudinal direction of the shaft, and the shaft was deformed to one side. All features were consistent with overstress failure in tension. A complete set of maintenance records were not available for review, thus, it could not be determined if the bolts met installation requirements or if regular inspection of bolt tightness was met.\u00a0",

The initial leg of the flight lasted about 20 minutes, and the pilot landed at the intended airport to pickup two passengers.  After a brief stopover, the pilot checked the fuel quantity to be below the fuel indicator tabs, and estimated the amount via an unapproved straw indicator; the flight then departed for the final destination.  The pilot reported that during the flight, the head wind conditions were stronger than he was anticipating and he decided to proceed to the closest airport.  Nearing the airport, the pilot switched between the airplane's two fuel tanks, exhausting the fuel in both.  About 2 hours 30 minutes after the initial departure, the pilot performed a forced landing 3 miles short of the alternate airport.  After touchdown, and during the landing rollout, the airplane's right main gear impacted a large rock, resulting in the airplane pivoting to the right and the nose gear collapsing.  The pilot stated that he performed a post-crash examination of the airplane and found both of the airplane's fuel tanks completely empty; the fuel gauges inside the cockpit indicated 1/8 fuel remaining in each tank.  A post crash examination of the fuel gauges revealed that the sending unit for the left tank read 1/4 of fuel remaining while in the empty position.  The Federal Aviation Regulations in 14 CFR Part 23 requires each fuel quantity indicator to be calibrated to read \"zero\" when the quantity of fuel remaining in the tank is equal to the unusable fuel supply.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning/decision and failure to divert to an alternate airport in a more timely manner, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a loss of engine power.  A factor in the accident was an inaccurate fuel gauge."
