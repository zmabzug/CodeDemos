The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the pilot was moving the recently-purchased airplane to the destination airport where it would be permanently based. According to a witness, he was outside his house when he saw the airplane \"extremely low, below 100 feet, at high speed doing knife edge turns.\" The airplane was maneuvering for about 5 minutes, then did a maneuver directly above the witness, recovered and flew off to the east. About 3 minutes later, the airplane returned and flew the same maneuvers. It made two to three tight turns at a low level and high speed, then went wings level. The witness then heard a \"pop\" and the engine quit. The airplane nosed down, the witness lost sight of it behind trees, then 2 to 3 seconds later heard a crash.The FAA inspector reported that there were impact marks that were consistent with one wing of the airplane hitting a power pole about 10 feet above the ground. The airplane then struck the ground about 35 feet from the power pole, and continued for about 120 feet until the left wing struck an abandoned house. The airplane then spun around and came to rest about 30 feet from the house.Due to the extent of damage to the airplane, flight control continuity could not be established. Both fuel tanks were ruptured, but upon the arrival of fire fighters, the odor of fuel was so strong as to prompt them to establish two water lines. The fuel selector was found on the right fuel tank, and the boost pump switch was in the off position. The gascolater was ruptured and the fuel filter was free of debris.A photograph of the propeller revealed a lack of torsional bending or other signatures of power. One blade was straight, while the other was bent aft 90 degrees. The propeller spinner exhibited aft crushing with no outward sign of rotation. The inspector was able to rotate the propeller to verify engine compression, and piston, valve and engine accessory drive continuity. The airframe and engine will be further examined.",

The pilot was unable to activate the runway lights at the airport, because the airplane's radios were inoperative, and he could not activate the runway lighting system.  The pilot stated he found the airport, but could not see the runway.  He decided to land without any lights.  He adjusted the flaps to no avail, because the flaps were electric.  Just before touching down he could see the white strips on the runway to his left. The airplane touched down, but the right landing gear was off the runway on the grass.  He applied power to make a second attempt.  On the second landing, when he saw the white strips, he was 'right on them,' flared, but bounced, and the airplane floated.  When he touched down again, 'the plane felt as if it was skidding sideways,' and he decided to go around again.  He said, 'I guess I must have become somewhat disoriented, as I banked left much too soon thinking I remembered trees at the end of the runway.  At that moment I saw the outlines of tree tops in front of me.  I tried to pick the lowest point, but struck one.  The plane began to tumble, and the I was on the ground hanging upside down from the seat belt.'  A test run was performed on the engine and no discrepancies were found.

The pilot initiated a forced landing on the remaining runway.  The aircraft touched down and the right main gear collapsed.  The right wing contacted the runway surface and the aircraft spun around coming to rest near the end of the runway.  Post-accident inspection of the engine found no evidence of a mechanical malfunction.  Both fuel tanks were inspected for fuel and a trace amount of fuel was found in each fuel bladder.

Both indicated empty when the float was extended to the bottom of the tanks and indicated fuel levels throughout the movement of the float from top to bottom.  Approximately three gallons of fuel was put in the right side fuel tank to inspect for leaks.  None were detected.

Once on the runway, the pilot back-taxied its full length and deployed a 10-degree flap setting for departure.  The pilot began the takeoff roll and rotated the airplane when it reached 90 knots.  The main wheels lifted off momentarily, then settled back on the runway.  The takeoff was aborted, but the airplane overran the runway departure end of the runway and collided with the localizer antenna.  A post-accident review of the company operations manual by the operator and the Federal Aviation Administration resulted in more stringent de-icing requirements for the flight crews and the addition of takeoff performance planning, as well as aborted takeoff criteria considerations for operations on contaminated runways.

Another passenger subsequently approached the airplane with two heavy bags. The first passenger put the larger bag in the baggage compartment, behind the rear seat. The second passenger then walked around the airplane and sat in the back seat with the smaller bag. During the takeoff, witnesses stated that the airplane appeared slow, with a nose-high pitch attitude, and an immediate dip of the right wing. They recalled the initial climb out was also low and slow. The tower controller asked the pilot if he was experiencing any difficulty, and the pilot responded that he was, and was going to turn back to the airport. A witness noted that the airplane appeared to be having difficulty gaining altitude, that the wings were moving up and down, and that the propeller was spinning. The airplane then made a sudden, sharp left turn and descended to the ground. A postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies. Damage was consistent with a left-turning stall/spin at impact.

About 60 feet off the ground he said he raised the landing gear and shortly thereafter the airplane did one yaw to the right, and one yaw to the left.  It then settled/pancaked straight down landing hard and flat, and then skidded some distance. According to the pilot the engine was producing good power, and was loaded within the weight and balance envelope, having 105 gallons of fuel on board, along with himself and two normal sized adults. The owner of the accident airplane said that he both observed the takeoff, and later spoke with the pilot while he was in the hospital, and the pilot told him that the takeoff roll had been uneventful, however, after rotating, and when about 50 feet in the air, the flight controls became mushy, and he did not have any elevator or rudder control. Other witnesses all stated that they saw the airplane lift off in the vicinity of the fuel farm, which is about 1100 feet from the beginning of the runway, and as the airplane climbed, they noticed that its wings began to rock increasingly, and the airplane began to porpoise. They further stated that the gear had been retracted when they saw the airplane at that point, and the airplane appeared as if it simply ceased flying.

The pilot transported three passengers to a remote landing site located adjacent to a stream and rock dam.  He had off-loaded the passengers and had departed the landing zone when the tail rotor assembly separation took place.  The pilot indicated that while cruising over a valley at 500 feet above ground level and at 90 knots, he experienced a high frequency vibration that lasted about 5 seconds.  This was followed by a \"bang,\" whereupon the helicopter violently reacted by yawing left and pitching nose down, and with a right rollover 90 degrees.  The pilot recovered from the unusual attitude after slowing to about 60 knots, and performed an autorotative descent to an uneventful landing.  Two of the three passengers that accompanied the pilot on the flight to the landing zone reported that the pilot was not certain of how to land the helicopter at the landing zone, as it was his second time landing in that area.  One passenger instructed the pilot to land with the tail boom facing down stream, but the other told him to land with the tail boom facing up stream.  The pilot followed the latter instructions and accidentally placed the tail rotor guard on a rock in the stream.  The passengers stated that after they disembarked, they noticed the tail rotor blades were turning in the water.  They attempted to notify the pilot, but were unsuccessful.  The separated components were not located during the course of the investigation.  Laboratory examination of the aft end of the tail boom revealed that the gearbox and tail rotor assembly separated from the tail boom due to a loss of clamp-up force in one or possibly both of the aft attachment bolt and nut assemblies for the tail rotor gearbox.  At the right aft attachment location for the gearbox, thread damage localized to only a part of the outermost thread of the right nut plate indicated that the right aft attachment bolt unscrewed from the nut plate.  The presence of fatigue cracking in the left and right nut plates also indicates insufficient clamp-up.  The aft attachment bolts for the gearbox should have lock wire that secure them to the gearbox; however, since all parts containing the lock wire are missing, there is no way to determine if the lock wire was in place.  According to maintenance records, a 100-hour inspection was performed 12 days (40.7 hours time in service) before the accident.  As part of the inspection procedures, the aft attachment bolts for the gearbox are checked for proper torque.  The mechanics that performed the inspection and checked the torque provided statements indicating that the torque was checked and the bolts were safety wired following the inspection.  One possible source for excessive vibration could be an inadequately balanced drive shaft from a tail rotor blade strike.",
            "probable_cause": "the in-flight separation of the tail rotor system as a result of a loss of clamp force and fatigue fracturing of the attachment nut plates.  The cause of the loss of clamp force was likely due to an inadvertent tail rotor blade strike during the previous landing, which resulted in an imbalance and a high frequency vibration that both induced fatigue in the nut plates and caused one bolt to back out.  The pilot's unfamiliarity with the landing area and his poor decision to land with the tail boom facing upstream were factors."

The pilot reported that the airplane was controllable until the loss of engine power.  The airplane impacted the ground in a 'yawed' attitude and tumbled, coming to rest in an inverted position.  During the final approach for the forced landing, the upper right flaperon had departed the aircraft approximately 300 yards before the impact site.  According to the pilot, who was also the builder of the airplane, he believed the flutter to be the result of his 'increasing the size of the flaperons from the designer's original design without a corresponding increase in the strength of the control system elements.'  Contributing to this was the fact that the flaperons had not been balanced.

The helicopter was landed without further incident.  Examination and testing of the Tandem Hydraulic Unit found the System 1 hydraulic pump leaking internally.  A nick and an abrasion were found in the edge of its longitudinal control slider.  Metallic chips were found in the hydraulic high and low pressure filters, and one chip was found in a groove of the longitudinal control slider.  The electrical portion of the 'jam-proof system,' which should activate the back-up hydraulic system two in case of a control slider jamming, only worked randomly.  The connector was heavily corroded and the magnetic core of the solenoid valve had an internal short circuit. ",

Postcrash examination of the aircraft revealed that the wire-wound sheathing surrounding the mixture control push-pull cable had separated from the solid fitting end which is held firm at the back of the instrument panel. This disconnection allowed the mixture control cable and surrounding wire-wound sheath to flex but prevented the cable from changing the position of the mixture control at the carburetor. ",

The airplane made a left turn towards a tree line, a second left turn, which paralleled the tree line, and a third left turn towards a field.  The airplane descended towards the field 'like it was trying to land.'  He further described the engine noise as 'missing, like the engine would stop and start.'  The airplane touched down towards the end of a 7.3 acre rectangular field, and struck a fence that was located about 83 feet beyond the airplane's initial touchdown point.  A post crash fire ensued.  Examination of the wreckage, which included an engine teardown, did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.

Witnesses reported that the ground roll, rotation, and initial climb were uneventful with the glider maintaining a high, nose-up pitch attitude, consistent with the first phase of a winch launch. The pilot made an appropriate airspeed call to the winch operator by radio, and, a few seconds later, while the glider was about 150 to 300 ft above ground level (agl), which was well short of the typical release altitude of between 1,000 and 1,500 ft agl, the glider released from the towline. The glider maintained the same pitch angle and then banked right with an accompanying full-right rudder deflection. The glider\u2019s nose then dropped, and the glider began a right spin toward the ground and then impacted terrain in a\u00a0nose-down attitude.\u00a0\u000b\u000bPostimpact examination did not reveal any anomalies with the airframe that would have precluded normal operation. The towline weak-link was intact, and the towline was continuous to the winch. The glider\u2019s line release mechanism, which could be controlled by both occupants, was functional. Given the lack of mechanical malfunction, it is likely that one of the occupants initiated the release of the glider.\u000b\u000bThe pilot, who was located in the aft seat, flew gliders regularly and was well acquainted with the airport environment, winch procedures, and accident glider operation. The passenger held an airline transport pilot license; he did not have experience flying gliders and was a passenger in the same glider earlier that day for an introductory flight.\u000b\u000bAlthough the pilot\u2019s autopsy determined that he had a mildly enlarged, dilated heart and the passenger\u2019s autopsy determined that he had coronary artery disease that had been treated with a stent, neither occupant\u2019s autopsy revealed any conclusive evidence to support impairment around the time of the accident. However, toxicological analysis revealed that the vitreous urea nitrogen levels for both occupants were twice the normal levels and that their creatinine levels were normal; such results can occur in the presence of dehydration. It is possible that the high temperature (112 degrees F) that day resulted in both occupants experiencing the effects of heat stress and dehydration. Further, individuals with cardiovascular disease and dehydration may be prone to decreased cardiac output, which results in dizziness and/or degraded cognitive function. \u000b\u000bEnough runway and overrun area remained to provide the pilot ample opportunity to perform an uneventful landing straight ahead even at the low altitude at which the glider was released. In fact, the glider club operating procedures called for a landing straight ahead following a glider release below 400 ft. The premature release and subsequent right banking turn at low altitude indicate that an unusual event likely occurred within the cabin; however, insufficient evidence existed to reach a definitive conclusion as to what occurred, including to what extent either occupant was impaired due to dehydration.

The private pilot and his flight instructor sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by Father John 77 Flying Club under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local area instructional flight that was originating at the time of the accident.The pilot flying, who was receiving a flight check to satisfy the flying club's insurance currency requirements, reported that he had not flown the tail wheel-equipped airplane since September 2013. He stated that during the takeoff roll, before the tail became airborne, the airplane suddenly entered a right swerve that he was unable to correct for with normal flight control and brake inputs. The flight instructor reduced engine power as the airplane departed the right side of the runway. The airplane subsequently collided with a hangar structure located alongside the runway. The left wing and fuselage were substantially damaged during the accident.The instructor pilot reported that the airplane entered a right swerve shortly after engine power was increased for the takeoff roll.

The commercial pilot and one passenger sustained serious injuries and the two other passengers sustained minor injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument rules flight plan was filed for the flight that departed the James M Cox Dayton International Airport (DAY), Dayton, Ohio, about 2023 with an intended destination of Lake Cumberland Regional Airport (SME), Somerset, Kentucky. The airplane was owned and operated by Absher Air LLC as a personal flight in accordance with the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to an interview the FAA inspector conducted with the pilot, a fuel crossfeed light illuminated, the pilot reset the indication, and the right engine immediately lost power while in cruise flight. He further reported that the autofeather system feathered the right engine propeller. The pilot could not recall feathering the left engine; however, due to the injuries the pilot sustained, the inspector suspended the interview until a later date.According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the airplane impacted the ground in a right wing low attitude. The airplane slid about 174 feet, impacted an embankment, became airborne, and then came to rest on airport property, about 238 feet from the initial impact location. According to FAA and local police photographs, the airplane came to rest upright, on the belly of the aircraft, parallel to an airport taxiway. The left engine propeller was found in the feathered position, separated from the engine flange, and was in the vicinity of the wreckage. All four propeller blades exhibited S-bending and chordwise scratching along the propeller face. The right engine propeller blade was in flat pitch; however, only one propeller blade was bent aft and no other damage was observed on the other three right engine propeller blades.Preliminary information revealed that the flight originated at Red Lake Airport (CYRL), Red Lake, Ontario, Canada, earlier in the afternoon, flew to Duluth International Airport (DLH), Duluth, Minnesota, where fuel records indicated the airplane was fueled with 140 gallons of Jet A fuel with prist. The flight departed DLH about 50 minutes later and then landed in DAY, prior to departing to SME. According to personnel at the three fixed base operations (FBO) facilities at DAY, the airplane was not fueled at DAY prior to departure. One FBO facility reported that security video captured the airplane taxiing onto the FBO ramp and the engines being shut down. Several people exited the airplane and were let out through the security gate to the parking lot. Subsequently, four people returned to the aircraft and it taxied out.The aircraft and engines were retained by NTSB for further examination.",

Witnesses reported that, following departure, they observed the airplane climb to about 500 to 600 ft above ground level while it was maneuvering onto the downwind leg. Witnesses also reported that the engine was producing abnormal sounds and appeared to lose power. While on the downwind leg, the pilot declared an emergency and indicated that the engine\u00a0had lost power; the air traffic controller then cleared the airplane to turn right onto the base leg and land. Witnesses reported that, as the airplane was turning from the downwind to the base leg of the traffic pattern, a wing dropped and that the wings were then nearly perpendicular to the terrain. Given the reported wind speeds, the airplane would have encountered a 13- to 20-knot tailwind on the downwind leg and up to 20-knot right crosswind gusts while on the base leg. The tailwind would have resulted in a groundspeed that was much higher than the airspeed, and the pilot likely did not recognize that the airspeed was low.

Ground scar analysis and wreckage fragmentation revealed that the airplane descended in a steep 45-degree, nose-down attitude before it impacted terrain, consistent with a loss of airplane control.

The witnesses said the airplane made a turn at the end of a field, appeared to stall, impacted the ground and burned.  The airplane was last seen about 150 to 200 feet above the ground in a turn.  The flight had departed with full fuel and 100 gallons of water.  The CFI was to observe from the ground, the pilot fly a Piper Pawnee aircraft into a local farmers field, while he practiced simulated spray runs, aerial applicator maneuvers, back and forth across the field.  According to the CFI, he had a two-way hand-held radio, and '...we each acknowledged a good radio check.'  The CFI said he then told the pilot he should takeoff and fly to the field, and the CFI drove his truck to the field to observe his progress.  As the CFI approached the edge of the field he said, the pilot was making his first pass into the field from east to west on the south side of the field, '...he looked steady and at a safe height of about 15-20 feet.  He exited to the west end of the field correctly and turned 45 degrees to the left at an altitude of about 150-200 feet above the trees and extended in a southwesterly direction for about 4-5 seconds before initiating a right hand reversal back into the field.  While his aircraft was in a right, medium-banked [sic] (30 degrees) level turn, I diverted my attention momentarily from the aircraft to park my truck.  After only about 5 seconds, I looked back into the direction where I had last seen the plane, and observed a plume black smoke coming from behind the trees, rising up about 100 feet from ground level.' According to the FAA Inspector's statement, the on site investigation revealed that the hopper was intact and empty of water.  The dump handle was found in the dump position.  The leakage of water on the ground near the crash site.  The elevator trim was found in the nose down position.  The elevator, rudder, and aileron continuity was established.  The seat belt was found in locked position [attached], on the ground, inside the cockpit, and the body of the pilot showed no evidence of the seat belt or harness being attached.  The cockpit frame work, inertial reel gear shift, and shoulder harness attachment cable, were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, DC, for examination.  The examination revealed that the inertial reel retraction cable failed due to wearing of the cable, over an undetermined period of time, after which the remaining wires of the cables failed in tensile overstress.  There was no evidence found to show that the cable was tied to the frame tube before or at the of the accident.  Nor could it be confirmed that the marks on the frame tube were caused by the shoulder harness attachment cable.  Three nearly equally spaced marks on the tube was suggestive of a series of ties, and not an individual tie for holding the separated cable to the framework.

There were no records found showing that the pilot had received any additional training in this make/model or category of airplane.  In addition, the owner/operator of the airplane, and the provider of the training for this type of operation were the same.  The training was conducted under the name of AG-FLIGHT Inc.  There is nothing in their circular that says a person applying for training needs any special certificate, a minimum of flight time or special experience.

One of the pilots contacted air traffic control and reported the airplane's altitude at 7,000 feet. The controller told the pilots to expect vectors for a visual approach to the destination airport. They cancelled their instrument flight rules flight plan, angled the airplane offshore, and completed a right-turning pattern before returning to the shoreline. About 13 minutes after sunset, the airplane again proceeded offshore and appeared to make a general, one and one-half, circle-like pattern to the left, with the last full circle much tighter than the first half circle. During the last full circle, the airplane's altitude decreased from 3,100 feet to 1,700 feet in 14 seconds, a rate of descent of about a 6,000 feet per minute. Witnesses stated that they saw the airplane descending at a high rate, not in a spin, but in a nearly vertical, extreme nose-low attitude before it impacted the water. Wreckage examination confirmed that the airplane impacted the water nose low, left wing down, and slightly inverted. No preexisting mechanical malfunctions or failures were noted with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation, and radar returns did not indicate that any objects detached from the airplane in flight.Weather observations recorded about 2 nm inland and about 10 minutes before the accident indicated visibility of 5 statute miles in light mist, scattered clouds at 800 feet above ground level (agl), and a broken cloud layer at 1,900 feet agl. With diminished lighting conditions, cloudy conditions inland, and a mostly overwater sight picture, it is likely that there was little or no discernible horizon. A loss of horizon reference is conducive to the onset of spatial disorientation. The pilot at the controls was likely not using or believing his instruments, instead, relying on his senses to determine airplane orientation. He then likely attempted to level the airplane by feel and by pulling back on the yoke while in the left turn, which made the turn tighter and lowered the airplane's nose until the airplane was in a vertical descent.

There, he fueled the aircraft with 58.15 gallons of fuel at 1503. The aircraft was taxied back to the pilot's hangar area. Sometime thereafter, the pilot had used a jumper cable to connect the battery of his car to the aircraft's electrical system at the power receptacle located on the left side of the nose. Approximately 1732, with both engines running, the pilot exited the aircraft to remove the chock from the nose-wheel during which the aircraft rolled forward (east) and eventually impacted a parked Cessna primarily along its leading edge of the right wing. The PA-30's right engine stopped upon wing contact, and the momentum carried both aircraft in a clockwise arc a short distance southeast. The PA-30's left engine continued running after the collision. At a point consistent with the PA-30's initial contact with the Cessna, a pool of blood identified the spot were the pilot was first struck by the PA-30's left propeller. He drug himself under the PA-30 and into a 4:30 position stopping at a point close to the nose-wheel chock which was entangled in the jumper cables. A witness who spoke with the pilot reported that he remarked that 'I knew better, (unknown) was not removed, and the wind caught me.' The pilot was airlifted to a major hospital and expired approximately 10 hours later. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command's exiting the aircraft with both engines running to remove a wheel chock. A factor was the inadequate preflight of the aircraft (not removing the chock) prior to engine start. "
