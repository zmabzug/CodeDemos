A witness to the accident stated that the airplane was approaching \"too hot\" and touched down three separate times due to its high approach speed.  On the third touchdown, the airplane's landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a stop.  Photographs of the runway surface displayed a noticeable crack running the length of the runway, left of the centerline.  Significant markings were located approximately midpoint down the runway.  Two parallel black skid marks with irregular zigzag patterns, exhibiting heavy tread markings, were also visible left of the centerline.  These skid marks were about 6 feet apart and parallel to the runway centerline.  The left skid mark was located about 6 inches left of the crack.  The right skid mark was located about 5 feet to the right of the crack.  There were two sets of six thin scrape marks dimensionally similar to propeller slashes in the runway surface located adjacent to each of the two black skid marks.  There was approximately 12 inches in between each of the scrape marks, which were perpendicular to the runway centerline.  One set of scrape marks was on the left side of the left skid mark.  The second set of scrape marks was on the right side of the right skid mark.  A third mark, located midpoint in between the two black skid marks, consisted of a skid mark, which was nearly covered by a white paint transfer. This mark ran parallel to the runway centerline.  All three skid marks faded as they continued down the length of the runway.  The accident aircraft was painted white.  The mechanic who examined the airplane after the accident stated that there was no evidence of a mechanical gear failure.  Flight control and flap continuity were also checked with no anomalies noted.  The flaps were examined, and found to be in the up position, consistent with the flap selector position.  The flaps were not damaged.  The mechanic noted that the flaps are normally damaged if they are in the down position and the gear collapses.  The pilot told the mechanic that he was not sure if he had put the flaps down during the approach.",

The flight was in instrument conditions on an IFR clearance and being radar vectored to the ILS final approach course at 3,000 feet when the breakup occurred.  The left wing tip and the outboard 1/2 of the left and right horizontal stabilators were the first pieces of wreckage in the 1/4-mile long debris path.  The horizontal stabilators exhibited permanent down deformation at the separation points.  The wings exhibited both up and down permanent deformation of the spars and other structural elements.  The fracture surfaces at the separation points for the wings and stabilators were consistent with structural overload.  There is no record that the pilot requested or received a preflight weather briefing. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued SIGMETs and AIRMETs for occasional severe turbulence, strong gusty winds, low level wind shear, and for occasional severe rime to mixed icing in clouds.  The SIGMETs and AIRMETS were valid prior to the pilot's departure and covered the timeline of the flight.  The NWS weather radar depicted moderate intensity echoes extending over the accident site.  While en route at 1219, the pilot requested the current destination weather from the center controller, who provided the METAR report of 10 miles visibility and broken layers at 4,000 and 20,000 feet.  Shortly after the pilot was given this observation, the destination conditions rapidly deteriorated to include lowering ceilings, strong and gusty winds, and moderate to heavy rain showers. The destination weather 30 minutes prior to the accident included winds gusting to 21 knots with scattered clouds at 3,800 feet, and a broken layer at 10,000 feet.  A special observation issued about 5 minutes prior to the accident indicated that winds were gusting 14 to 19 knots, visibility was 2 miles in moderate rain and mist, a broken ceiling was at 2,800 feet, and the sky was overcast at 5,000 feet.  It noted that rain began about 15 minutes earlier than the observation time.  Five minutes after the accident, another observation reported that the winds were gusting to 21 knots, visibility was 1 1/2 miles with moderate rain, and broken and overcast ceilings at 2,100 feet and 4,700 feet respectively.  The crew of a Boeing 757 making the approach 10 minutes after the accident reported a 45-knot crosswind shear at 100 feet, and light to moderate turbulence throughout the approach.   An analysis of the weather conditions at the time of the accident, including radar and satellite sensor imagery, disclosed that strong weather echoes existed near the accident site with embedded areas of intense to extreme echoes.  The tops were in excess of 33,000 feet.  The analysis indicated that several low level wind shear layers were present with moderate to severe turbulence.",

He disengaged the autopilot and resumed manual control of engine RPM.  As the pilot was turning toward his home base, the pilot re-engaged the autopilot, and the engine RPM began to increase and decrease.  The pilot was unable to control the RPM and initiated an autorotation to a field.  The helicopter landed hard separating the tail boom and fracturing two arms of the main rotor starflex. The helicopter was equipped with a Turbomeca Ariel 2B series engine, which incorporated an electronic engine control unit (EECU) that electronically controlled engine fuel flow via a Hydromechanical Metering Unit (HMU).  Data retrieved from the helicopter's flight data computer revealed that the fuel-metering unit valve had malfunctioned.  Further investigation revealed that there had been 10 previous incidents worldwide where there was an internal failure in the EECU, which resulted in a red \"GOV\" warning light illuminating during flight.  When this light illuminated, it caused the fuel metering valve to freeze in the position it had at the time of the detection, and therefore engine power could no longer be automatically controlled. The HMU consisted of a resolver and a stepper motor.  The resolver measured/sensed the position of the fuel metering valve. The stepper motor took commands from the EECU and physically moved the metering valve.  In automatic mode, the HMU compared the resolver information and stepper motor information, as to the position of the fuel -metering valve.  When a cumulative mismatch of greater than 7 degrees occurred, the red \"GOV\" light illuminated and the pilot had to revert to manual mode for throttle operation.

The purpose of the Part 135 commercial air ambulance flight was to transport a 15-month-old patient from one hospital to another.  Immediately following the takeoff from an airport elevation of 6,814 feet above mean sea level (msl), witnesses observed the airplane initiate a left turn to the north and disappear. Satellite tracking detected the airplane a shortly after departure, when the airplane was flying at an altitude of 6,811 feet msl, an airspeed of 115 knots, and a course of 072 degrees.  The airplane impacted terrain at an elevation of 6,860 msl feet shortly thereafter, about 4 miles southeast of the departure airport.  The pilot, flight nurse, paramedic, patient, and patient's mother were fatally injured. When the airplane failed to arrive at its destination, authorities initiated a search and the wreckage was located the next morning.  Documentation and analysis of the accident site by the NTSB revealed that debris path indicated a heading away from the destination airport. Initial impact with trees occurred at an elevation of 6,860 feet. Fragmented wreckage was strewn for 1,100 feet down a 4.5-degree graded hill on a magnetic heading of 141 degrees. The aircraft's descent angle was computed to be 13 degrees, and the angle of impact was computed to be 8.5 degrees. There was evidence of a post-impact flash fire. Both engine and propeller assemblies were recovered and examined; the assemblies bore signatures consistent with engine power in a mid to high power range. The flaps and landing gear were retracted, indicating that the pilot did not attempt to land the airplane at the time of the accident. Flight control continuity was established, and control cable and push rods breaks exhibited signatures consistent with overload failures.  There was no evidence of any pre-impact mechanical malfunction found during examination of the available evidence.  The pilot had logged 2,775 total flight hours, of which 23 hours were in the accident airplane. Toxicology testing detected chlorpheniramine (an over-the-counter antihistamine that results in impairment at typical doses) and acetaminophen (an over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer often known by the trade name Tylenol and frequently combined with chlorpheniramine).  No blood was available for tox testing, so it is not possible to accurately estimate the time of last use, nor determine if the level of impairment that these substances would have incurred during the flight.

He \"topped off\" the 24-gallon fuel tank with 21.5 gallons of fuel.  The pilot then performed two takeoffs and landings to familiarize himself with the airplane.  The familiarization flight lasted about 20 minutes, and then the pilot let the engine idle on the ground for approximately 20 minutes, before he departed about 1400 on a cross country flight.  \"About\" 1630, a witness observed a blue and white airplane circling a lake about 200-300 feet above the ground.  The witness heard the engine noise cease, return, and cease again.  The airplane then disappeared from sight, and the wreckage was located 5 days later.  It was about 1.5 miles from the lake, and 100 miles east of the destination airport.  During examination of the wreckage, an FAA inspector did not find any fuel in the tanks or carburetor.  He did find about 1/4 ounce of fuel in the fuel bowl.  The inspector also found a piece of paper in the wreckage that revealed the pilot planned the flight to be 2 hours and 30 minutes, at 150 knots.  However, the previous owner and a witness stated the airplane cruised about 110-120 knots.  According to the engine manufacturer, the engine consumed about 7.2 gallons of fuel per hour at 75% cruise performance.  Review of the data revealed that at performance cruise, for 3 hours and 15 minutes, the engine would consume approximately 23.4 gallons of fuel.  Although the autopsy report indicated that the pilot died from the rupture of a pre-existing abdominal aortic aneurysm, evidence observed by rescue personnel suggested that the pilot initially survived the impact and attempted to activate the ELT and egress the airplane.

After landing the helicopter in a suitable area, although with potholes and cattle hoof prints in the dried mud, the pilot performed a stability check with the cyclic and then lowered the collective to the full-down position. With the engine at 100-percent power, the pilot added cyclic and collective friction to prevent the controls from inadvertently moving while he reached to retrieve his lunch from a bag located just aft and right of his seat; he did not engage the collective lock. The pilot let go of the cyclic with his left hand and, while guarding it with his legs, used both hands to seal the lunch bag and replace it behind the seat, which resulted in the pilot experiencing a momentary loss of situational awareness due to distraction. At that moment, the pilot felt the nose of the helicopter begin to get light on the skids with a slight upward pitch change. The pilot then placed both hands back on the controls and added forward cyclic to correct for the increase in pitch and to ensure positive skid contact with the ground; the cyclic and collective friction remained applied. The helicopter then began to exhibit vertical dynamic oscillations, which continued to resonate and worsen, consistent with the onset of ground resonance. It is likely that at least one, if not both, ground resonance straps were in a pothole depression and not in contact with the ground. When the condition worsened, the pilot made a positive collective application to lift the helicopter off the ground in an attempt to regain stability. As the helicopter began to ascend, it lurched forward and downward in an unusually nose-low attitude, which resulted in the lower wire strike blade contacting the ground and establishing a pivot point. The pilot then made an aggressive aft cyclic movement with a positive collective input to arrest the nose-down attitude. The tail skid subsequently impacted the ground, pushed the vertical fin and tail rotor gearbox upward, and severed the tail rotor drive shaft forward of the tail rotor gearbox. The tail of the helicopter then bounced upward from the impact followed by an uncommanded left yaw around its nose. The helicopter continued to spin left until the pilot reduced the collective to arrest the spin. The helicopter then touched down in a nose-up attitude and settled upright on its skids. A postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that the pilot's inability to regain control was due to the loss of the tail rotor drive, which occurred as a result of the pilot's aggressive overapplication of the flight controls. The pilot's actions resulted in the tail skid impacting terrain, which damaged the tail rotor gear box and severed the tail rotor drive shaft.",

The density altitude at the 2,200-foot msl accident site would have been about 5,000 feet.  The normally aspirated engine's critical altitude is 4,000 feet and the Rotorcraft Flight Manual shows that the maximum available manifold pressure at that altitude is 24.8 inches.  The pilot said that he chose a spot suitable to hover for a closer look at items of interest on the ground.  He made a shallow approach to the spot and loaded the rotor blades as the helicopter slowed; when the helicopter reached a hover, the manifold pressure was at 25 inches.  The next thing the pilot realized was that the rotor rpm was near the bottom of the green arc and the helicopter was settling toward the ground.  The pilot reduced the collective a small amount and rolled the throttle full on; however, the helicopter began settling faster.  The pilot used collective in an attempt to cushion the landing but the skids touched down hard on a large rock, bending the skids and fuselage structure and damaging the tail boom.  The pilot reported that after the helicopter came to rest when the collective was lowered all the way the rotor rpm recovered.  The pilot then completed a normal engine cool down and shutdown procedure.  The pilot said that when the rpm first decayed and the helicopter began to settle, he initially thought about trying to fly forward out of the descent.  Large rocks, high brush, and rising terrain were directly in front, and he feared that the damage and injury potential there was much worse if the helicopter had continued to settle.

The rotorcraft began to settle.  The PIC, perceiving that he had encountered rotor vortex conditions, slipped the helicopter to the right with the bucket still in the reservoir.  This, in turn, increased the angle of the long line from the vertical or zero degree reference.  Immediately thereafter, the PIC noted a loss of power in the #1 engine.

Post-crash examination revealed that the long line had pulled aft and left from its vertical reference into the airframe structure (the 7:30 position of the hell hole in the belly of the helicopter) resulting in 1) the separation of one of the #1 engine push/pull rods, and 2) the deformation of engine control rods associated with the #1 engine flight idle stop (solenoid) which then sheared.

The tower controller instructed the Cirrus pilot to extend his downwind leg to follow the Gulfstream and then instructed him to report when he had the Gulfstream in sight. The Cirrus pilot made his base turn towards the final approach course before reporting the Gulfstream in sight, which resulted in the Cirrus being in very close proximity to the Gulfstream. The Cirrus pilot had the discretion to turn from the extended downwind to the base leg prior to the controller advising him to do so; however, when he made this decision it then became his responsibility to maintain safe separation from the Gulfstream.After several traffic advisories from the controller to the accident pilot, the pilot finally reported the Gulfstream in sight, at which point the Gulfstream was about 0.11 nautical miles ahead of--and 200 to 300 feet higher than--the Cirrus on final to runway 3. The controller then radioed the Cirrus pilot to stand by for a possible go-around and the pilot replied that he was standing by. The controller instructed the Cirrus pilot to start a climb and go around. Three seconds later, an unidentified pilot radioed the controller that an airplane on final had just gone down; no further communications were received from the Cirrus pilot. About 7 seconds before the accident, the Cirrus was at an altitude of 1,400 feet above ground level. The Gulfstream had passed that location about 30 seconds earlier and 150 feet higher than the Cirrus. The upset and loss of control most likely occurred as a direct result of an encounter with the wake turbulence generated by the Gulfstream while the Cirrus was in trail and on final approach to the runway. An onboard recording device revealed that at 0954 the Cirrus experienced an upset, rolling rapidly from 35 degrees left-wing-down to over 77 degrees left-wing-down, before rapidly rolling to 25 degrees right-wing-down.

The truck beam had accumulated 24,025 cycles since new and 2,707 cycles since its last overhaul which occurred in May, 2005.The truck beam fracture initiated by fatigue and stress corrosion cracking from pits that were present on the ID surface of the truck beam, under the protective finishes.  Crack propagation occurred by alternating modes of stress corrosion cracking and fatigue until final fracture occurred by ultimate ductile separation. The condition of the surface finishes and base metal at the fracture initiation area indicated that the pitting was present before the last application of cadmium plating and primer, rather than the result of corrosion since the last overhaul. The observed pitting appeared to be remnants of incomplete corrosion removal during the last overhaul. Residual stress analysis of the ID surface in the fracture initiation region suggested that the blended area did not receive adequate peening to restore typical residual compressive stresses.  The observed reduction in residual compressive stresses likely contributed to the fracture initiation. The wall thickness at the area of fracture initiation measured 0.29\u201d and was within drawing dimensional tolerances.  Chemical analysis and hardness testing verified that the truck beam was fabricated from the required material in the specified heat treated condition.

Papillon Airways Inc., DBA Grand Canyon Helicopters, was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The commercial pilot with a certified flight instructor (CFI) certificate was fatally injured; the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The local repositioning flight departed 1G4, about 1555. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a company flight plan had been filed.The accident site was 1.75 nm east of 1G4, located at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, approximately 380 feet west of the Colorado River (west shore). The wreckage was found resting on its right side located at the subject landing pad.Witnesses reported that the pilot landed and was planning on exiting the helicopter to perform a \"fluid level check.\" After landing, the pilot exited the running helicopter; shortly thereafter the helicopter became airborne without the pilot at the flight controls. The helicopter subsequently impacted the ground and rolled over. The pilot was struck by one or more of the main rotor blades and was fatally injured. The helicopter was examined on site by the investigation team. No abnormalities with the helicopter airframe or engine systems were noted. The helicopter was recovered for further examination.The helicopter was equipped with an Appareo Vision 1000 cockpit imaging and flight data monitoring device. The Appareo device was undamaged and shipped to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory in Washington, DC, for data extraction. The helicopter was equipped with a 406-mhz Emergency Location Transmitter (ELT). The Armed Forces Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) received the ELT activation at 2300z (1600 hours mountain standard time.) The first activation did not have any latitude or longitude information. However, the second activation was received at 2329z, which was 29 minutes after the accident with lat/lon data that was 1,500 yards north of the accident site.

According to the flight crew, the captain was landing on runway 2 using a flaps 42 (full down) setting.  The ATIS was reporting winds from 060 degrees at 18 knots with gusts to 26 knots.  Both pilots stated that as the airplane descended through 30 to 40 feet agl, a sudden high sink rate developed.  The captain added power and pitched the nose up to arrest the rate of descent.  All three crewmembers said that the landing was harder than normal, but none would classify as a \"hard landing.\"  According to the airport METAR, the winds at 0954 were from 060 degrees at 22 knots with higher gusts to 27 knots.  Review of the high resolution ASOS wind data from a sensor near the touchdown zone for the runway disclosed no significant speed variations in either the head or crosswind components during the last 10 seconds of the approach.  An FAA inspector entered the cockpit after the aircraft had been parked at the gate and observed the captain's airspeed indicator final approach speed bug setting at 142 knots.  According to the airline's L-1011 Operations Manual, the inner bug is set to the final approach speed, which is Vref adjusted for 1/2 of the steady state wind plus all of the gust additive.  The final bug setting cannot be less than Vref + 5, nor more than Vref + 20.  For the aircraft's landing weight, the zero wind Vref was calculated at 138 knots, with a wind adjusted final approach speed of 150 knots.  Read out of the Flight Data Recorder disclosed that in the 48 seconds prior to touchdown, the calibrated airspeed varied from 154 to 145 knots.  In the 10 seconds prior to touchdown, the airspeed varied from 143 to 130 knots at wheel contact.  In the 10-second period before touchdown, the airspeed decreased from 143 to 135 knots, then increased to 143 knots 3 seconds later, and then steadily decayed to the 130-knot value recorded at ground contact.  At touchdown, the aircraft was 8 knots below the no-wind reference speed, and, 13 knots below the airline's minimum specified speed. The maximum pitch attitude value of 8.79 degrees aircraft nose up was 4 degrees less than the maximum allowable pitch attitude to prevent a tail strike.  Teardown of the left and right main landing gear assemblies revealed no discrepancies, and no write-ups were found in the maintenance records for the previous 180 days. ",
            "probable_cause": "The captain's failure to maintain the proper wind-adjusted Vref airspeed, by a margin which varied from 7 to 20 knots too slow, during the final 10 seconds of the approach prior to touchdown. "

Because of thunderstorms south of the airport, the approach control area supervisor for Mount Vernon (MTV) attempted to coordinate with the airport tower supervisor to stop departures from runway 1 and temporarily land arrivals on runway 19, opposite to the traffic flow in use. According to the airport\u2019s standard operating procedures, requests for runway changes must be approved by a tower supervisor, but the tower supervisor was unable to take the call because he was on a different phone line and distracted by administrative duties. Instead, a traffic management coordinator took the coordination call. A misunderstanding occurred between the MTV supervisor and the traffic management coordinator. The coordinator stated that she had missed the supervisor's reference to use of runway 19, and instead thought arrivals would be continuing to use runway 1, only with reduced spacing. The coordinator relayed the incorrect information to the local controllers responsible for the runways. The local controllers subsequently released two departures from runway 1 and both flights lost required separation with the first arriving airplane inbound from the northwest to land on runway 19.",

The pilot did not note any airplane anomalies during the startup, engine run-up, or takeoff. The pilot reported that it was a clear, calm morning, and he made the decision to fly on the left side of a canyon. The pilot indicated that when he wanted to climb out of the canyon, power increases did not seem to help, so he slowed the airplane to 70 knots indicated airspeed to minimize the turnaround radius to exit the canyon. He stated that he slowed the airplane a little more to make the turnaround and remembered feeling/seeing the airplane hit a tree. A postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no anomalies with the flight controls or engine. A camera in the cockpit, which recorded video of the accident flight, also revealed no airplane or engine anomalies. The airplane was observed impacting trees on rising terrain. Warmer-than-standard temperatures on the day of the accident resulted in a high density altitude and reduced climb performance of the airplane.An FAA publication, \"Tips on Mountain Flying,\" indicated that pilots should carefully consider their experience and background before beginning a flight into mountainous terrain. It urged pilots to consider attending a recognized mountain flying course to attain the knowledge and skills needed for safe flying. The publication further stated that pilots should wait until they have at least 150 hours of pilot-in-command time before taking mountain training, as more experienced pilots have had time to become more familiar and comfortable with the airplane and with flight planning.The pilot stated that he had received instruction on assessing canyons from a previous mountain flight.

He applied full engine power, but the airplane continued to descend and collided with several spruce trees.  The airplane received structural damage to the wings and fuselage.  The pilot said the wind conditions were light and variable.  The pilot reported that the airplane did not have any mechanical malfunction.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain altitude/clearance while maneuvering, which resulted in a collision with trees.  A factor contributing to the accident was dusk lighting conditions."

The pilot turned toward the nearest airport, and the engine stopped running.  After attaining best glide airspeed, the pilot felt the airplane wouldn't make it to the airport, so he force-landed in a field.  The pilot flared the airplane \"a little high,\" and landed hard.  A post-accident examination of the airplane revealed 110 ml of fuel in each tank, with no evidence of leakage.  En route, the pilot had to deviate once due to weather and once due to a restricted area.  The pilot also reported operating the airplane 4.5 hours since the last fuel stop.",
