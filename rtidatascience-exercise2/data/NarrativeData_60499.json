The landing gear system, including the emergency extension system, was reportedly operationally checked during the annual inspection without any anomalies noted. Due to damage sustained in the accident, the landing gear could not be functionally tested; therefore, the reason for its collapse could not be determined. Although the airplane battery did not hold a charge during postaccident testing, the alternator functioned properly. Electrical power should have been available from the alternator once the engine was running, regardless of the condition of the battery. The reason for the electrical system failure could not be determined.",

While about 100 feet above decision height for the ILS approach to runway 5, the pilot did not have the runway environment in sight and started to make the motions to go-around, but did not increase engine power. He then observed the runway centerline markings and due to excess speed and a tailwind, the airplane floated and landed long. When asked about the touchdown point location and speed at touchdown, the pilot estimated it was about 1,000 feet before the departure end of the 7,001-foot-long runway, at a speed of 85 knots. He applied the brakes, but the runway was wet and he did not feel deceleration. He left the flaps fully extended as the airplane traveled off the end of the runway, coming to rest upright in a grass area.

Prior to takeoff he advised an air traffic controller that he would like to conduct three approaches, starting with a very-high frequency omnidirectional radio range (VOR) approach. At the completion of the VOR approach, the controller offered the pilot the option of landing or executing a low approach. The pilot elected to execute the low approach and was issued a frequency change, which he acknowledged. During the missed approach, the pilot was then directed by the air traffic controller to proceed direct to the VOR, hold northeast of the VOR, to maintain 3,000 feet above mean sea level (msl), and to advise when he was ready to commence the instrument landing system (ILS) approach. The pilot then transmitted to the controller that he had gotten himself \u201ca little out of whack\u201d and that he was \u201cjust trying to straighten it out.\u201d Review of radar data revealed that, at the time the pilot transmitted this information to the controller, the airplane had begun to turn right and continued turning right for about 150 degrees before radar contact was lost. The airplane then struck a tree, a travel trailer, and a pickup truck, fatally injuring the pilot and one occupant of the trailer and seriously injuring the other occupant of the trailer.

The ceiling at the airport at the time of the accident was at 600 feet msl, and the minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the VOR approach was 560 feet msl, a difference of only 40 feet. There were no witnesses who observed the airplane during the approach, and the pilot did not report to the air traffic controller the actual altitude of the base of the overcast layer. It is therefore uncertain as to whether the pilot ever entered visual conditions when the airplane approached the MDA prior to executing the missed approach procedure.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot obtained a weather briefing prior to the flight to Akron-Canton Regional Airport (CAK), Ohio, from College Park, Maryland. During the briefing, the pilot proposed a route of flight at an altitude of 6,000 feet. The briefer told the pilot that the freezing level at CAK at the time of the briefing was about 3,000 to 4,000 feet, but that the it may drop to the surface as the day progressed. The pilot indicated at the beginning of the 20-minute briefing that he was aware of the hazardous weather conditions and he expressed concern about them, but he decided to depart to CAK shortly after he received the briefing.At the time of the accident, weather observations at CAK indicated broken clouds at 500 feet above ground level (agl), and overcast skies at 100 feet agl. Meteorological analysis showed a high likelihood of encountering supercooled large droplet (SLD) icing in the area. General aviation pilots operating into and out of CAK surrounding the time of the accident all reported icing conditions, with most of the icing occurring between 3,000 to 3,500 feet. The reports also indicated freezing rain. Three of the pilots reported a rapid accumulation of between 1 and 2 inches of ice within a 15-minute period prior to and after the accident.  One pilot reported that he required a significant amount of engine power to maintain airspeed and had a hard landing due to ice accumulation on his airplane. As the accident airplane approached CAK, the local air traffic controller (ATC) issued the pilot a vector to the instrument landing system (ILS) localizer course about two miles from the runway\u2019s ILS outer marker. The controller advised the pilot to maintain 3,200 feet until established on the approach, and that the airplane was cleared for the approach. The pilot acknowledged and asked if there were any pilot reports of icing below 6,000 feet in the area. The controller responded that there were no reports of icing at that time, but asked the pilot to advise if he encountered any. The pilot did not report icing conditions.The pilot made a gradual left turn to intercept the localizer, and then leveled out near the approach course heading. Although left of the localizer course, he began descending on the approach and stabilized the airplane at an airspeed of just over 100 knots. The controller told the pilot that he was left of the approach course centerline. The pilot acknowledged and reported that he was \"correcting.\" Recorded radar track information showed that the pilot did not correct to the right, but continued to fly a course to the left of, and almost parallel to, the approach course centerline.The controller then told the pilot that he was \"well left\" of the approach course. The airplane briefly turned right toward the approach course centerline, but seconds later, the airplane rolled into about a 30-degree left bank, and began turning away from the approach course centerline.  While at 2,800 feet, the pilot requested clearance to perform a nonstandard 360-degree turn while about 2-1/2 miles northeast of the airport in order to reestablish the airplane on the approach course (the pilot had commenced the turn before hearing back from the controller). The controller responded that he was unable to approve the pilot's request.The controller then instructed the pilot to climb and maintain 3,000 feet. The airplane's left bank gradually increased to about 40 degrees at that time. The controller asked the pilot for his present heading and the pilot responded \"due north and climbing.\" The airplane began to climb while remaining in a 30 to 40-degree left bank. The controller instructed the pilot to climb without delay. Pitch increased above 20 degrees with the airplane still in a 30-degree left bank, and with airspeed significantly decreasing. Shortly thereafter, the airplane entered a spiral-like dive as the pilot declared an emergency. The controller advised the pilot to \u201c\u2026maintain altitude. The airport is two miles west of you,\" but the pilot did not respond and there was no further contact with the airplane.  During these last radio transmissions, the airplane was in a continuous left turn with decreasing radius until it abruptly dropped off the radar. A ground witness saw two bright lights coming almost nose first toward the ground with the engine \u201croaring.\u201d The airplane impacted the ground in a nose-down and left-wing-low attitude. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. An NTSB sound spectrum study of digital audio recording of ATC communications indicated normal engine operation. Analysis of recorded radar data indicates that the airspeed, roll, and initiation of a climb brought the airplane close to an aerodynamic stall as it was maneuvering in a steep turn following the controller's instruction of \"no delay\" and the pilot's declaration of an emergency. The airplane subsequently stalled and rapidly descended to the ground.  The characteristics of the descent are consistent with an abrupt stall during maneuvering that was likely aggravated by ice accumulation on the airplane. Risk factors for spatial disorientation were present at the time of the accident, including dark night instrument meteorological conditions and maneuvering flight. The airplane's sequence of sustained turns was conducive to spatial disorientation, specifically a class of vestibular illusions known as somatogyral illusions. Furthermore, the pilot's report that he was headed \"due north and climbing\" as he placed the airplane into a turn of decreasing radius was inconsistent with his having an accurate awareness of the airplane's orientation.The pilot reported a total flight time of 510 hours on his October 2007 FAA medical application, of which 50 hours were accumulated in the past 6 months. The pilot's total and recent instrument flight experience could not be determined. The pilot had a history of seasonal allergies, treated with prescription medication that was reported to the FAA. While an over-the-counter sedating antihistamine was found in the pilot's blood during postaccident toxicology testing, the investigation was unable to determine if the pilot was adversely affected by impairment.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s inappropriate control inputs as a result of spatial disorientation, which led to an aerodynamic stall and loss of control. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's decision to conduct flight into known icing conditions, ice accumulation that reduced the airplane's aerodynamic performance, and the pilot's failure to initially intercept and establish the airplane on the proper approach course."

Except for the final 48 seconds of the 25-minute flight, the captain was the flying pilot, and the first officer was the nonflying pilot.  When the airplane was about 0.5 nm inside the outer marker on the first approach, the compass warning flag on the captain's course deviation indicator appeared, indicating that the heading display was unreliable.  The airplane deviated from the localizer centerline to the left but continued to descend.  After about 1 minute, during which time the airplane's track continued to diverge from the localizer centerline, the flight crew executed a missed approach.  The flight crew then unsuccessfully attempted to clear the compass flag by resetting circuit breakers.  The captain directed the first officer to request a second approach.  Contrary to company crew coordination procedures, the flight crew did not conduct an approach briefing or make altitude callouts for either approach.  Although accurate heading information was available to the captain on his radio magnetic indicator, he experienced difficulty tracking the localizer course as the airplane proceeded past the outer marker on the second approach.  The captain transferred control to the first officer when the airplane was 1.9 nm inside the outer marker.  The airplane then began to deviate below the glideslope.  The descent continued through the published decision height of 200 feet above ground level, and the airplane struck 80-foot-tall trees.  Postaccident testing revealed that the first officer's instruments were displaying a false full fly-down glideslope indication because of a failed amplifier in the navigation receiver.  The glideslope deficiency was discovered 2 months before the accident by another flight crew.  An FAA repair station attempted to resolve the problem and misdiagnosed it as \"sticking\" needles in the cockpit instruments.  The operator was immediately advised of the problem.  The operator's minimum equipment list for the airplane required that the problem be repaired within 10 days, but the operator improperly deferred maintenance on it for 60 days and allowed the unairworthy airplane to be flown by the accident flight crew.  The airplane was not equipped with, nor was it required to be equipped with, a ground proximity warning system, which would have sounded 40 seconds before impact. ",
            "probable_cause": "The flight crew's continued descent of the airplane below the glideslope and through the published decision height without visual contact with the runway environment.  Also, when the captain encountered difficulty tracking the localizer course, his improper decision to continue the approach by transferring control to the first officer instead of executing a missed approach contributed to the cause.  In addition, the following were factors to the accident:  (1) American Corporate Aviation's failure to provide an airworthy airplane to the flight crew following maintenance, resulting in a false glideslope indication to the first officer; (2) the flight crew's failure to follow company crew coordination procedures, which called for approach briefings and altitude callouts; and (3) the lack of an FAA requirement for a ground proximity warning system on the airplane.

According to a witness, who was at the airport and observed the airplane takeoff from the 2,900-feet long by 50-feet wide turf runway, the airplane made a \"slight\" descent after liftoff, pitched up, then subsequently stalled.  Another witness recalled hearing a \"chugging\" noise coming from the airplane's engine.  The airplane impacted terrain at a nose-low attitude, left bank, rotated 180 degrees, and came to rest in an open grass field, approximately 100 feet to the left of the centerline and 102 feet from the departure end of the runway.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the fuel selector valve was found in the right tank position, the throttle was full forward, the primer was locked, and the mixture was near the idle cut-off position.  Flight control continuity was established.  Both main fuel tanks were breached.  The gascolator was observed to be dry.  An area several feet in diameter of dead grass was evident beneath both fuel tank areas.  Further examination of the engine established valve train continuity through the accessory gears.  The spark plugs were removed and the engine was rotated by hand from the propeller flange.  Compression was noted on all cylinders and spark was obtained from both magnetos during rotation.  All of the cylinders were inspected using a lighted borescope.  No anomalies were noted.  The number 1 and 3 cylinder bottom spark plugs were found to have excessive lead fouling at the electrodes.  Fuel was observed in the electric boost pump.  The fuel screen was observed to be clean.  The induction air filter was found fuel soaked.  The carburetor fuel inlet screen housing was fractured.  The carburetor was removed and dissembled.  Metal floats were observed, and the fuel bowl was found empty.  The engine fuel lines were destroyed.  The crankshaft propeller flange and exhaust system were bent aft.  The oil cooler exhibited impact damage, and a hole was observed in the oil sump at the rear of the engine below the accessory housing.  The last annual inspection was completed on February 7, 2003, and was signed off by an A&P.;  The engine had been removed from another airplane on July 25, 2001, at a time of 283.42 SMOH.

He reported in writing that he personally filled both fuel tanks on August 27th while at the Palm Beach County Glades Airport, then repositioned the airplane after fueling on a 18-minute flight to the North Palm Beach County General Aviation Airport where the airplane was secured and not operated until the 12th of September.  On that date he operated the airplane on a cross country flight that lasted a total of 1.4 hours; no fuel was purchased after landing.  He operated the airplane the next day (13th of September) also on a cross country flight lasting 1.8 hours.  After landing, 25 gallons of fuel were added to each of the two 42-gallon total capacity fuel tanks.  The airplane remained overnight and the following day (14th of September), he departed on another cross country flight lasting 1.7 hours; no fuel was purchased after landing.  During his preflight inspection of the airplane for the accident flight, he did not notice any fuel leaking from the airplane, and the quantity of fuel indicated by the fuel gauges agreed with what he calculated should be in the fuel tanks.  The accident flight departed with a reported 51 gallons of fuel on-board and the fuel selector positioned to the right fuel tank.  The flight climbed to 5,500 feet and approximately 30 minutes into the flight, he repositioned the fuel selector to the left tank.  He noted no fuel flow and the engine quit.  He repositioned the fuel selector back to the right fuel tank and engine power was restored.  He reviewed the emergency procedures and again positioned the fuel selector to the left tank, \"...since I knew I needed that fuel.  I got the same result and switched back to the right tank.\"  Engine power was restored and at that time, the flight was approximately 25 miles west of Okeechobee County Airport (OBE).  He elected to divert there and when the flight was approximately 6-7 miles west of OBE, \"...the right tank went dry and the motor quit.\"  At that time the airplane had been airborne for approximately 42 minutes.  He made several attempts to get fuel out of the left fuel tank by yawing and banking with no success.  He maneuvered the airplane for a landing on a road, and first noticed a fence crossing the road when the airplane was 100 feet above ground level.  He was committed to the landing, and touched down on the road just short of the fence.  The right wing of the airplane collided with a fence causing the airplane to veer to the right.  The airplane came to rest upright with the right main landing gear collapsed.  He further stated that he used 15 gallons-per-hour for fuel consumption calculation purposes which is supported by the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).  The airplane had been airborne since having the fuel tanks filled to the accident a total of 6.0 hours, with 130 gallons of fuel available.  He also provided information about one flight in the accident airplane where he departed with full fuel tanks, flew 3.6 hours, and after landing added 51 gallons of fuel for an average fuel consumption of 14.16 gallons-per-hour.  The flight he provided information on only included 1 takeoff, while 5 takeoffs including the accident flight were performed since the fuel tanks were filled, or fuel added.  His written statement did not indicate that he visually inspected the fuel tanks during his preflight inspection prior to any of the flights.  He later reported verbally that he did visually inspect the fuel tanks before each flight.  Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed the fuel tanks did not contain any fuel and the gascolator only contained drops of fuel.  A blue colored stain was noted on the bottom surface of the left flap.  No fuel stains on the upper surface of the wings aft of either fuel cap were reported by the FAA inspector or observed by NTSB in pictures provided to the NTSB by the insurance adjuster.  The FAA inspector reported that he believed the fuel stain was not fresh; it was old.  The left fuel tank vent line was found to be partially plugged by a mud dauber's wasp nest at the inlet opening.  Both fuel gauges were found to indicate empty with electrical power applied.  One propeller blade was bent due to impact with a fence post while the other blade was undamaged.  Examination of the engine revealed crankshaft, camshaft, and valve train continuity.  Cold differential compression testing of the cylinders using 80 psi as a base indicated all were 64 psi or greater.  The magnetos operationally tested satisfactorily and were timed 20 degrees before top dead center; specification is 22 degrees before top dead center.  According to the mechanic who maintained the airplane and inspected it following recovery, he did not see any evidence of compromise of any fuel tank.  He did note the fuel stain on the left flap but did not know the source for the stain.  FAA records indicate that the pilot did not have a single engine land rating on his airline transport pilot certificate.  Review of the airplane \"Owner's Manual\" revealed section 5 titled \"Operational Data\" indicates, \"Note also that the range charts make no allowances for wind, navigational errors, warm-up, take-off, climb, etc.  You must estimate these variables for yourself and make allowances accordingly.\"  The manual also states that during preflight inspection of the airplane, the fuel vent opening is to be checked for stoppage.",

A finding in the investigation was the inadequate preflight inspection of the airplane by the pilot-in-command for his failure to note a partial blockage at the inlet of the left fuel vent line."

The public-use flight was conducted for the purpose of demonstrating rotor blade tracking and balancing to an aviation maintenance technician class. The helicopter was placed facing south into the wind on the asphalt ramp about 150 feet in front of the maintenance hangar. The doors of the hangar face north, and the hangar \"seemed to block the wind in the run-up area.\" The pilot described the weather as \"quite windy (20-25 knots est.) with scattered cumulus, very gusty, temperature around 50 degrees.\" In an interview conducted on the day of the accident, the pilot told a police officer that he had lifted the helicopter to a hover at 6 to 8 inches above the ground and was about to set it down, but mistakenly rolled the throttle on instead of rolling it off. The helicopter lifted to just above the height of the hangar and was caught by a gust of wind. The pilot attempted to descend, but when the helicopter descended below the height of the hangar, it \"lost the wind lift and began to descend too fast.\" Initially the pilot reported to the Safety Board investigator that he intended to fly, however, in a written report submitted 11 days after the accident, the pilot stated that he had \"no intent or expectation of flight,\" and that he \"suddenly and unexpectedly\" found himself \"5 to 10 feet in the air, out of control.\" The helicopter was drifting toward the students who were standing about 100 feet away. The pilot attempted to turn away from the students and set the helicopter down as quickly as possible. The helicopter touched down tail low and hard on the left rear skid, the main and tail rotor blades contacted the ground, and the helicopter rolled on to its left side. The pilot's medical certificate and flight review were expired. He reported no flight hours in the 90 days preceding the accident, and he told the police officer that \"it had been a while\" since he had flown a helicopter. Following the accident, the university implemented changes in class procedures for all maintenance courses.

During a high gross weight normal takeoff procedure, from a 3,640-foot-long asphalt runway, at 79 degrees F., the airplane became airborne at 80 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).  The nose rose higher than needed, most likely due to elevator trim setting, which required the pilot to push forward on the yoke.  The airplane accelerated to 90 knots, but did not initially climb out of ground effect, and then began a very slow climb.  During the slow climb, the pilot elected to \"clean up\" the airplane by retracting the landing gear and the 10 degrees of flap extension.  The airplane subsequently sank at the end of the runway, and the pilot decided to abort the takeoff.  A test run of the engine revealed that it was producing about 4.5 percent less than the maximum Brake Horsepower (BHP).  Examination of the engine revealed that the throttle adjustment was not correct, per a manufacturer service instruction.  During a recent annual inspection, the throttle was adjusted, but there was no record of the manufacturer service instruction being utilized.  Although the make and model airplane flight manual (AFM) checklist did not specify climb performance with regards to flap retraction during a normal takeoff, the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook suggested that the flaps should be retracted once a positive rate of climb is established.  For short field takeoffs, the Airplane Flying Handbook stated that the flaps and landing gear should remain the takeoff position until clear of obstacles and Vy has been established.  When the Vy has stabilized, the gear and then the flaps should be retracted.  It advised to raise the flaps in increments to avoid sudden loss of lift and settling of the airplane.  The Vy for the accident airplane was 110 knots.",
            "probable_cause": "Improper maintenance of the throttle linkage, which resulted in a lack of engine power during takeoff.  Factors were the pilot's premature retraction of the flaps, an improper elevator trim setting, a high gross takeoff weight, and a high density altitude; which resulted in settling during the initial climb and a subsequent emergency landing after takeoff."

Review of the pilot's personal medical records revealed that about 3 years before the accident, he was found to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Subsequent treatment with medications was unsuccessful, and 1 year before the accident, he underwent a procedure to ablate a foci initiating the abnormal heart rhythm. The procedure was initially successful with a return to normal sinus rhythm, but by 1 month before the accident, the atrial fibrillation recurred and medications were restarted. Toxicological testing confirmed the presence of medications used to treat high blood pressure, control the rate of atrial fibrillation, and thin the blood.None of the cardiology or prescription medication information was reported to a Federal Aviation Administration aviation medical examiner during any of the pilot's applications for medical certificates. Had the pilot reported the atrial fibrillation, he would have been initially disqualified for a medical certificate. However, pilots with well controlled rates, who are mostly asymptomatic and without concomitant coronary artery disease, could be issued a special issuance medical certificate with appropriate follow-up. In the pilot\u2019s case, such follow-up would have likely detected the undiagnosed coronary artery disease, which, in combination with the atrial fibrillation, put him at increased risk for sudden cardiac death. It was very likely that the pilot became impaired or incapacitated by his underlying cardiac disease during the accident flight.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s loss of airplane control due to impairment or incapacitation as a result of coronary artery disease in combination with atrial fibrillation. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to report his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to the Federal Aviation Administration, which would have required follow-up testing that would likely have detected his undiagnosed coronary artery disease."

However, no advisories, either before or during the flight, were issued for the potential of hazardous icing conditions.The pilot stated that he had all of the airplane's deicing equipment on; however, the airplane accumulated moderate to severe airframe icing. The airplane was cleared for a GPS approach to the airport, and the pilot reported that he used the autopilot to fly the airplane to a navigational fix. An air traffic controller saw that the airplane was off course and subsequently canceled the flight's approach clearance. The copilot's window iced up. The flight was then cleared for another approach attempt, during which the pilot's window became \"halfway iced up.\" The controller advised that the airplane appeared to be \"about a half mile south of the course\" for runway 25. The pilot configured the airplane with approach flaps and extended the landing gear before the final approach fix. The airplane descended under the cloud deck, and the pilot began to look for the runway. The pilot stated when he advanced the throttles, the airplane rolled about 90 degrees to the left. He disengaged the autopilot and attempted to use the yoke to level the airplane. The airplane then rolled about 90 degrees to the right. The pilot was unable to regain airplane control, and the stall warning horn came on seconds before the airplane impacted the ground. The pilot stated that he believed the loss of control was \"primarily due to ice.\"The pilot stated that he maintained a target airspeed of 120 knots on approach, 100 knots \"close to the ground,\" and was close to 80 knots when the airplane was in the 90-degree right bank. The airplane's recommended minimum airspeed for sustained flight in icing was 140 knots. The airplane's pilot operating handbook (POH) advises pilots to immediately request priority handling from air traffic control to facilitate a route or an altitude change to exit the icing conditions. Additionally, the handbook cautions the pilot that autopilot usage masks tactile cues, which indicate adverse changes in handling characteristics, and that use of the autopilot is prohibited when any specified visual cues exist in icing conditions.While the National Weather Service (NWS) issued an icing advisory over an area bordering the destination to the north, no NWS icing advisory extended over the area where the accident occurred. While the pilot would have been aware of potential icing from his weather briefings, he may not have expected the hazard due to the absence of an icing advisory over his route. If the pilot relied upon the graphic presentation provided in the icing advisory, which did not extend to his intended route, he may have been led to believe that he could accomplish the flight safely.",

A map of the 891.72-acre application area showed that it was asymmetrical and that it included a series of diagonally adjoining rectangular fields bounded by fences and property and an irregularly shaped field bounded by a curved highway. The fields to be treated were located north, south, and east of the accident site. According to an aerial application pilot familiar with the work site, if the accident pilot were following a north-south application path, it would have been appropriate for the airplane to fly over the accident area in straight-and-level flight without spraying any materials in that area.

He said that the practice approaches that he completed were uneventful.

The pilot said that the fuel selector was on the left wing tank, and the corresponding fuel quantity gauge indicated that the tank was empty. He switched the fuel selector to the right tank, which he used during the practice approaches; however, an attempted restart  was unsuccessful. He conducted a forced landing to a road, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, horizontal stabilizer, and rudder.

Following a maximum gross weight takeoff, the airplane climbed to a cruise altitude of 9,500 feet msl.  About 20 minutes into the flight, the pilot heard a loud \"pop\" sound and the left engine surged once.  The pilot immediately turned around and started back toward lower terrain.  He then attempted to restore power by following the checklist items, but was unsuccessful, and he then completed the shutdown and feather checklists.  While proceeding to the closest airstrip for a landing, the airplane would not hold altitude at best single engine rate of climb airspeed and began to drift down.  The pilot believed he would have an insufficient altitude margin to make any of the nearby landing airstrips or clear the mountainous terrain between his position and the departure airport.  The pilot elected to land on the beach of a lake.  During the landing rollout, the aircraft encountered moderately sized rocks and collapsed the nose and left landing gear.  The left engine was installed on a test stand and examined.  The only discrepancy was a fractured fuel injector line for the No. 6 cylinder injector nozzle.  The fracture was completely through the line near the manifold end at a brazed joint between the line and a larger diameter ferrule end.  No support clamps were observed on this line between the manifold and the injector nozzle.  Support clamps were found on the injector lines to the remaining 5 cylinders.  The fractured fuel injector line on the No. 6 cylinder was replaced with a serviceable line and the engine was started, accelerated to full power, and met all specifications.  Metallurgical examination of the fractured fuel injector line found that it failed in fatigue from multiple origin sites on the line's outer surface.  No material defects or mechanical damage, which could have contributed to the crack initiation, was found at any origin site.  No evidence of clamps was found at any point along the line length.  AD 93-02-05 applied to this engine and mandated compliance with Lycoming Service Bulletin 342A.  The provisions of the AD and the SB require a one time inspection, then recurring inspections of the fuel injector lines at each 100-hour inspection, at each overhaul, and after any maintenance has been performed where the lines have been disconnected, moved or loosened.  The line inspection involves looking for any evidence of cracks, dents, or other unserviceable wear indicators.  The SB requires that any line found without clamps supporting the line run must be replaced, and that each line must be clamped.  Specific clamping points for each line are noted on a diagram for each engine model incorporated within the Service Bulletin.  The engine was last inspected on July 14, 2000, 23 hours prior to the accident.  The fuel injection system on this engine is a constant flow type and a leak in any one line would reduce the flow to the other cylinders, which would result in an excessively lean condition.  Based on both the pilot's report of the conditions at the landing site and the METAR from the closest aviation observation station, the density altitude on the surface was calculated to be 4,700 feet.  The outside air temperature at the site, and the estimated temperature at the aircraft's cruise altitude, were outside of the temperature envelope for a positive rate of climb on the aircraft's single engine climb performance chart in the Airplane Flight Manual. According to Piper, the temperature lines on the charts are limits and no extrapolation can be made for points outside of the temperature lines. ",
            "probable_cause": "The fatigue fracture and separation of the No. 6 cylinder fuel injector line due to the company maintenance personnel's failure to comply with an Airworthiness Directive.  A factor in the accident was the company's decision to operate the aircraft in environmental conditions, which were outside of the single engine performance capability of the aircraft. "

The pilot, who was the sole occupant, was not injured. The helicopter sustained substantial damage. The helicopter was registered to Fly Right Heli LLC, Adel, Iowa, and operated by Vista Helicopter Service LLC, Boone, Iowa, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an aerial application flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed. According to the pilot, he was returning to his truck to refill the helicopter with more application. While flying about 150 feet above ground level, he maneuvered the helicopter up to avoid an obstacle. During the maneuver he pitched the nose up to climb and then pitched the nose down to a steep angle of descent. When the helicopter entered the nose low attitude, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot made a forced landing to a corn field. The responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector conducted a postaccident examination of the helicopter and an engine test run. The engine started immediately and no anomalies were noted. The inspector recovered 11-12 gallons of aviation gasoline from the fuel tanks. The helicopter has been retained for further examination.",

Then the aircraft was observed at 26,000 feet, and subsequent contact was lost. The pilot did not respond when ATC queried him about exceeding his assigned altitude. The aircraft sustained an inflight breakup during an uncontrolled descent, and came to rest in a tree. According to the surviving passenger, the airplane was refueled and a portable oxygen bottle was filled prior to takeoff. She stated that they were going to take aerial photographs at four separate locations during this flight. She said that they shot three of the locations and landed at Williamsburg, Pennsylvania where the pilot filed a flight plan and setup the portable oxygen system for their use during the next flight. They departed and climbed to 10,000 feet, and the pilot told her to put her oxygen mask on, and he did the same. The last altitude she remembered the pilot calling out was 20,000 feet, and he asked her how she was doing and if she felt okay and she said yes.  When asked, 'who turned on the oxygen?' she stated that she did, started to but wasn't sure how, so, the pilot reached back and turned it on.  She said she knew it was on because she could feel the cool air and that there was a little valve in both lines and they went from red to green indicating the oxygen was flowing. She said that she remembered him saying that they had just crossed 20,000 feet and she began feeling dizzy, she said that her eyes would not focus, and that she felt like she was cross eyed. She said she told the pilot that she was dizzy but she thought that he was talking to the tower because he did not respond. She recalled that she felt better when she closed her eyes, when she did, that was the last thing she clearly remembered until after the crash. Analytical testing of the contents of each cylinder used to fill the pilot's oxygen bottle found that they contained compressed breathing air at about 21 percent oxygen instead of aviation oxygen.

The pilot said both landing gear A-frame type gear assemblies rotated outward and upward, as the airplane settled onto the ice.  He said that the touchdown was not hard, and the common point of failure was at the center, fuselage-mounted spring shock assembly.  Each landing gear assembly has an extended arm that attaches in the center of the fuselage to the bottom end of a vertically mounted oleo shock.  The left gear arm attaches to the oleo lug by a clevis bolt that is installed front-to-back.  The bolt also retains the top end of two oval-shaped metal link plates that are positioned vertically at the front and aft side of the oleo attach lug.  A clevis bolt, through the bottom hole of each link, retains a spacer and the right landing gear extended attaching arm.  Each clevis bolt uses a tension castle nut, with a cotter pin for security.  The aft link plate had extensive elongation of the upper bolt hole radius.  The forward link plate upper bolt hole was fractured, and had opening and elongation of a segment of the bolt hole radius.  The upper clevis bolt was found at the scene, but its castle nut and cotter pin were not located.  The clevis bolt was bent along its span.  The threaded portion of the bolt had flattening of the threads about 1/3 of its circumference, and partial threads on the remaining 2/3 of its circumference, with slight necking of the bolt end.  An FAA aerospace engineer examined the recovered parts and reported, in part, that:  \"...the cotter pin failed in service, or was never installed, and the shear nut loosened and fell off the aft end of the upper bolt, or was never installed.\"  The airplane had accrued 11 hours since the most recent annual inspection.",

He reported there were no weather returns in the area and they were back in smooth air after the encounter.  The first officer reported that he informed the flight attendants to take their seats as soon as they began to encounter the turbulence.  He reported he was getting ready to call the flight attendants after the turbulence to make sure they were alright, when the cockpit received a call from the back stating that one of the flight attendants injured her ankle.  The first officer reported that they requested paramedics meet the flight upon landing.  The injured flight attendant reported she was in the aft galley when they encountered the turbulence.  She stated she tried to get in the jumpseat, but was unable to because of the turbulence.  The injured flight attendant stated she heard another flight attendant tell a passenger who was in the aft galley to sit on the floor, so she decided to do the same.  She stated that as she was sitting down, the \"plane dropped\" and she fell.  Once the turbulence subsided, the other flight attendant and a passenger helped her off the floor and into a seat.  None of the flight attendants recalled having any advance warning of the turbulence.  Rapidly building convective activity was evident along the upper Mississippi Valley at the time of the accident.

Additionally, the accident flight was the first flight after the airplane's most recent annual condition inspection, which was completed about 2 weeks before the accident. The airplane made two touch-and-go landings uneventfully. The third landing was full-stop, followed by the pilot back-taxiing to the run-up area and testing the engine. Following the engine run-up, the pilot intended to take off again; he told the air traffic controller that he wanted to fly over the airport at 3,000 feet to do a system check. A witness stated that, during the takeoff, the wings started to rock back and forth. The pilot indicated to the air traffic controller that he wanted to return to the airport, and he began a slow left turn. About one-fourth of the way through the turn, the airplane stalled and descended nose-low into the ground.

The propeller blade and engine damage were consistent with little or no rotation at impact. Adequate fuel was found in the fuel system, and no evidence of contamination was noted. On-scene and metallurgical examination of the wreckage and fuel components did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions.

The airplane directly ahead of N304PA was N434PA.  After being handed off from Los Angeles Center, the flight crew of N304PA contacted the TRACON sector controller at 2043:48 PDT, reporting level at 8,000.  The TRACON sector controller instructed the pilot to fly heading 260 after the Julian VOR and intercept the localizer.  At 2045:47, the TRACON sector controller told the pilot of N434PA to descend to 6,000 feet.  The pilot of N434PA acknowledged the clearance.  At 2047:55, the sector controller transmitted, \"Seminole four papa alpha descend and maintain five thousand two hundred.\"  The pilot of N304PA responded, \"Down to five thousand two hundred for three zero four papa alpha.\"  According to information provided by the TRACON sector controller, this clearance was intended for N434PA.  The controller did not recognize that the clearance had been acknowledged by N304PA rather than N434PA.  At 2049:55, the pilot of N304PA reported that he had ATIS information Zulu and the sector controller responded, \"Seminole three zero four papa alpha thank you very much.\"  At that time the data block on the TRACON controller's display was showing N304PA descending through about 6,600 feet.  The Minimum Enroute Altitude for the airway segment being flown was 7,700 feet.  At 2050:27, the sector controller again cleared N434PA to descend and maintain 5,200 feet.   A Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) alert on N304PA was presented to the Center controller at 2049:03. The aircraft's data block remained on the Center controllers display until the radar controller forced it off at 2050:07.  The Center controller did not notify the TRACON sector controller that he was receiving a MSAW alert as required by FAA directives.

The aircraft then descended below radar coverage, the track went into coast status, and the alert terminated.

He therefore decided to increase his approach speed by 10 knots. In addition to the increased airspeed, the pilot flew a flatter than normal approach descent angle. Due to the increased airspeed and the flatter approach, the airplane floated longer than normal after the initiation of the landing flare. Instead of executing a go-around after it became obvious that the airplane would not settle to the runway near the normal touchdown point, the pilot elected to continue the landing sequence. Once the airplane touched down, the pilot was unable to get it stopped in the remaining runway, and it departed the end of the runway and experienced a nose gear collapse after encountering rough/uneven, swampy terrain.  The expected landing distance for the airplane was calculated based upon the Vref plus ten airspeed of 108 knots, a landing gross weight of 11,000 pounds, and the reported ambient weather conditions. According to those extrapolated calculations, the landing distance would have been expected to be about 3,100 feet. This distance does not include the use of thrust reversers, as the Model 560 landing performance charts for dry hard surface runways do not take into consideration use of the thrust reversers.   The performance section of the Model 560 FAA-Approved flight manual stated that the landing is to be proceeded by, \"...a steady three degree angle approach down to the 50-foot height point with airspeed at Vref in the landing configuration.\"  According to Cessna Aircraft, maintaining a flatter approach, or an airspeed above designated Vref, will extend the landing distance beyond what is published in the performance tables.  Review of the archived aviation surface weather observations (METAR) for Ravalli County Airport revealed that the winds measured at 1053, eight minutes after the accident, were from 150 degrees at five knots.

The pilot chose to stay aloft to see which direction the weather was moving. When the thunderstorm started moving east toward the pilot he decided to land. The pilot reported that while he was on final approach for the runway, he was hit by a gust front, the wind shifted and he was blown to the north side of the runway and landed on a dirt road. During the landing roll the glider impacted a fence post and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and right wing.",

The airplane touched down left of runway centerline, approximately 3,100 feet from the beginning of the 5,601-foot runway.  The left main landing gear folded, and the airplane bounced.  It then touched down on the right main landing gear, about 200 feet further down the runway.  It then settled on the left propeller and fuselage about the 2,000 feet-remaining marker, and skidded an additional 1,100 feet.  Post-flight examination revealed that the left main landing gear inboard retract cylinder clevis was fractured approximately 1 1/8 inches below the attaching bolt hole.  Additionally, a crack at the center of the upper drag brace was found in the webbing where the landing gear door actuating mechanism attached.  Laboratory examination of the fracture in the retract cylinder clevis revealed features typical of a bending overstress separation.  Laboratory examination of the upper drag brace crack revealed small fatigue crack regions on both sides of a manufactured hole, with no evidence of preexisting mechanical damage, or other defects in the hole.  Remaining portions of the crack in the upper drag brace were consistent with overstress. ",
