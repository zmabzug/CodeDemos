After landing on runway 18R, another Boeing 737 took the high speed exit onto taxiway Whiskey Mike and was cleared to cross runway 18L.  The pilots of both aircraft saw a possible impending collision and took evasive action.  The taxiing aircraft continued to the gate and deplaned the passengers.  The departing aircraft continued the takeoff, returned to the airport and landed.  Examination of this airplane revealed damage to the skin on the underside of the tail.  At the time of the runway incursion, the West air traffic control tower's ground control west one and local west one controller positions were combined.  The west air traffic control tower supervisor-in-charge was operating the flight data position along with performing his own supervisory duties.  During this time, a National Air Traffic Controllers Association representative had entered the tower cab and was having a meeting with the supervisor-in-charge.  In an interview, the incident controller reported that he did not scan runway 18L before clearing the taxiing aircraft to cross.  FAA Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Control Handbook,  paragraph 3-1-3, \"Use of Active Runways,\" states, \"The local controller has primary responsibility for operations conducted on the active runway and must control the use of those runways.\"  Paragraph 3-1-12, \"Visually Scanning Runways,\" states that, \"Local controllers shall visually scan runways to the maximum extent possible.\"",

Just after rotation, the airplane veered to the left, and went off the left side of the 7,575 feet long by 150 foot wide runway.  The airplane came to rest in a ditch that borders the runway, and sustained substantial damage to the wings and fuselage.  The pilot stated that prior to her being cleared for takeoff, a DeHavilland DHC-8 departed from the opposite direction on the same runway.  She said that about 2 minutes elapsed between the larger aircraft's departure, and her departure.  The Air Traffic Controller's Manual (FAA order 7110.65M) relating to wake turbulence application, states that a 3-minute interval be observed between departures of large and small aircraft, and the issuance of a wake turbulence advisory before clearing the aircraft for takeoff.  The manual identifies a DeHavilland DHC-8 as a large turboprop aircraft, and a Cessna 152 as a small aircraft.  Review of air-ground radio communications tapes revealed that the total time separation between the two departures was 1 minute, 49 seconds, with no issuance of a wake turbulence advisory. ",

A postflight examination of the airplane found ice in its tailcone stinger, through which the rudder and elevator control cables run. Further investigation discovered that other Cessna 560XL airplanes had encountered the same problem. The design of the airplane was such that water could enter the tailcone, collect there, and freeze around the rudder cables during operations in subfreezing temperatures. The manufacturer had issued a service letter (SL) in 2005 to add a drain hole in the tailcone stinger for in-service airplanes and added a drain hole to production airplanes; this incident airplane had a drain hole in its tailcone that was consistent with the SL. Therefore, the drain hole specified in the SL was not sufficient to correct the problem. In addition, the investigation discovered that some production airplanes had drain holes that were smaller than the size specified in the SL. The manufacturer subsequently issued an alert service letter (ASL) in January 2011 to inspect the existing drain holes to ensure they were the right size, seal an existing drain hole, and add another drain hole in the aft canted bulkhead; however, in March 2011, an airplane modified in accordance with the ASL experienced stuck rudder controls; ice and water were found in its tailcone stinger. The manufacturer subsequently issued a mandatory service bulletin (SB) in October 2011 that specified additional modifications intended to reduce the amount of moisture that can enter the tailcone stinger and to improve the drainage. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) district office that oversees the production certification of the Cessna 560XL and the manufacturer's issuance of associated SLs and SBs did not detect the improper-sized holes on some production airplanes. The manufacturer subsequently implemented a specific inspection to verify the drain hole installation on production airplanes, and the FAA has followed up.",

The captain and the first officer reported that during final approach, it felt like the airplane was \u201cpushed up\u201d as the wind shifted to a tailwind or updraft before landing near the runway number markings. Upon touchdown, the captain applied the brakes and thought that the initial braking was effective; however, he noticed the airplane was not slowing down. The captain applied maximum braking, and the airplane began to veer to the right; he was able to correct back to the runway centerline, but the airplane subsequently exited the departure end of the runway and traveled down a steep embankment.  A pilot-rated passenger reported that throughout the approach to landing, he thought the airplane was high and thought that the excessive altitude continued through and into the base-to-final turn. He added that the bank angle of this turn seemed greater than 45 degrees.Recorded communication from the cockpit voice and data recorder (CVDR) revealed that during the approach to landing, the flight crew performed the landing checks, and the captain noted difficulty judging the approach.  About 1 minute later, the recording revealed that the ground warning proximity system reported \u201cfive hundred\u201d followed by a \u201csink rate, pull up\u201d alert about 16 seconds later.  Data from the CVDR revealed that about 23 seconds before weight-on-wheels was recorded, the airplane was at an indicated airspeed of about 124 knots and descending.  The data showed that this approximate airspeed was maintained until about 3 seconds before weight-on-wheels.  The recorded data further showed that the approach speed was set to 120 knots, and the landing reference speed (vREF) was set to 97 knots.  Using the reported airplane configuration and the 3.5-knot headwind that was reported at the time of the approach and landing, calculations indicate that the vREF speed should have been about 101 knots indicated airspeed, which would have required a landing distance of about 3,112 feet. Utilizing the same airplane configuration and wind condition with the flight\u2019s reported 124 knot indicated airspeed just before touchdown, the landing distance was calculated to be about 5,624 feet. The intended runway for landing was 5,132-feet long with a 1.9 percent downward slope gradient, and a 123-foot long overrun area.A postaccident examination of the airplane, including the braking system, revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

The 1,800-hour commercial pilot, who reported having accumulated 35 hours in the make and model, reported a loss of engine power prior to entering the downwind leg while on a local flight.  According to the pilot, the airplane had been flown under a ferry permit \"several months ago\" to another airport where an annual inspection was to be completed.  The airplane had not been refueled since the ferry flight.  The pilot reported that he was planning on making two local flights in order to show the four-place airplane to two separate passengers.  During his preflight inspection, prior to the first flight, the pilot noted that all the fuel tanks, including the two auxiliary fuel tanks, appeared to be full and free of contaminants.  On the first flight, the pilot reported flying north of the airport for approximately 7 to 10 minutes, performing several maneuvers, and then return to the airport for a full stop landing.  The first flight was uneventful.  On the second flight, the pilot took the second passenger and followed the same route taken on the previous flight.  While returning to the airport, when approximately 4 or 5 miles short of the airport, the pilot switched the fuel selector to the left main tank and reduced power.  Immediately after the power reduction the pilot noted that the engine \"lugged down and roughened.\"  After attempting different power and mixture settings, the pilot switched to an auxiliary fuel tank, and then switched back the left main fuel tank.

While on the ground she was in communication with her spouse who was providing her with weather updates from the local area FAA flight service station (FSS).  They both decided that she would stay the night and he would drive out and pick her up.  About an hour later, she and her husband decided that it would be okay for her to continue her flight home if she took an alternate route that would take her south, away from the encroaching weather.  Once she found better weather in a southerly direction she would then continue her flight to the west to her intended destination.  The pilot reported to her husband that she would file a flight plan in the air; however, there was no record of one being filed.  Her husband notified the FAA when the pilot did not arrive at her destination airport.  Search and rescue personnel located the wreckage 5 days after the accident in a mountainous canyon area.  The airplane came to rest on the side of a canyon wall oriented in an uphill direction, after it had clipped several trees.  The accident site was about 200 feet below a mesa, at an elevation of 4,600 feet.  Investigators located all of the major components of the airplane and noted that the CAPS system (Cirrus Airframe Parachute System) had deployed due to impact forces, and was lying next to the airplane in the debris field.  The airframe and engine inspections revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operations.  There were no radio communications received by any air traffic control facilities from the pilot during the accident flight.  The weather in the area at the time of the accident showed that the cloud bases were near 6,000 feet with the cloud tops above 15,000 feet.  Visibilities were between 0 miles in the clouds and 3 miles below the clouds, with a freezing level near 6,500 feet.  Another pilot flying northeast of the accident site reported moderate rime and mixed icing conditions from 8,500 feet to 16,000 feet.  Recorded weather briefings between the FAA FSS and the pilot's spouse indicated that he received all the pertinent weather information for the flight.  The spouse relayed that he told her there were no buildups for a flight to the southeast.  An in-flight weather advisory for AIRMET Zulu Update 4 for icing issued by the National Weather Service for the time of the accident reported moderate icing between 9,000 feet to 18,000 feet.  The freezing level was forecasted to be between 4,000 and 8,000 feet. The FAA approved airplane flight manual contains several locations where it indicates that flight into known icing is prohibited.  According to astronomical data from the US Naval Observatory, sunset on December 18th occurred at 1724 MST, and the moon was below the horizon.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain terrain clearance during cruise flight while flying at night at an altitude to remain clear of clouds and icing conditions.  Contributing to the accident were an inadequate weather evaluation, the clouds, icing conditions, and the dark night lighting conditions."

He leveled the wings and pulled out of the dive at FL 190.  The autopilot (A/P) was re-engaged and the flight was completed to its intended destination without further incident.  A visual examination after the descent revealed the left front baggage door open and buckled, and the left and right wings showed skin damage and wrinkling approximately 54 inches from the wing roots.  When tested, the autopilot and flight director performed within test specifications with only \"minor\" deviations.  Both vacuum pumps tested within test specifications.  The right side attitude indicator continued to show a three degree turn even after a kink in the vacuum supply to the right side attitude indicator was removed.  The \"normal\" static system leaked in excess of allowable limits; however, the valve was found to be in the \"alternate\" position before it was tested.  An active noise-canceling set of headphones was found connected to the pilot's side of the cockpit.  The A/P disconnect tone was found to be operating normally while the engine was at idle power.  During the test, it was noted that the tone was difficult to hear while wearing the headset.",

The last radio contact with the flight was at 0447.  At 0520, radar contact was lost.  The airplane impacted in rough terrain, at a steep angle of impact. Two other company pilots flying in trail of the accident aircraft said, they had radio contact with the pilot of N840FE about 5 minutes before the accident.  They said he sounded fine and did not say anything about any problems.  Radar data showing the flight's ground speed indicated that at 0512, the ground speed was 158 knots (182 mph).  The ground speed then decreased to 153 (176 mph), 143 (165 mph), 138 (159 mph), and 132 (152 mph), until at 0519:40, when the ground speed of the flight was 125 knots (144 mph).  After the radar read out at 0519:40, the next radar hit was coast (no information), and then the flight disappeared from the radar scope.  The airplane's heading and altitude did not change during the decrease in ground speed.  According to the NTSB Radar Data Study, calculated flight parameters indicated the airplane \"...experienced a slow reduction of airspeed in the final 8 minutes of flight at altitude, and then abruptly exhibited a sharp nose down pitch attitude with a rapid increase in airspeed.\"  About the time of the reduction in airspeed, pitch angle began to slowly increase also.  When radar contact was lost, the calculated airspeed had reduced to less then 102 knots [118 mph], and calculated body angle of attack [AOA] had increased to 8.8 degrees. A large reduction in pitch angle, angle of attack, and flight path angle as the airspeed increases after peak AOA was reached.  Examination of the engine Power Analyzer and Recorder (PAR) revealed that no exceedences were in progress at the time power was removed from the PAR.  It was determined that no caution timing events were in progress.  The PAR computer appeared to be operating correctly until power was removed at impact.  Examination of the airplane's autopilot were not conclusive due to impact damage.  Determination of whether the autopilot was engaged or not engaged at the time of the accident could not be determined.  The NTSB Meteorological Factual Report revealed that at 0515, about 7 minutes before the flight was lost on radar, the radiative temperature in an area centered at Clarksville (4 kilometer resolution data), showed that the Mean Radiative Temperature was -6.26 degrees C (21F).  The Minimum Radiative Temperature was -6.66 degrees C (19F).  The Maximum Radiative Temperature was -6.06 degrees C (21F).  According to the Archive Level II Doppler weather radar tape for a beginning sweep time of 0508:10, showed that N840FE had tracked into a weather echo from 0510:34, to 0516:28.  The Doppler Weather Radar data, revealed that N840FE, had entered a weak weather echo about the same time that the airspeed of the airplane started to decrease, at an altitude of about 9,000 feet, and the airplane was in the weak weather echo for a few minutes.  Based on the weather data, it was determined that in-flight airplane icing conditions were encountered by N840FE.  Cessna Aircraft Company Airworthiness Directive (AD) 96-09-15; Amendment 39-9591; Docket No. 96-CE-05-AD, applicable to this airplane and complied with by the company, on December 12, 1996, stated:  \"...to minimize the potential hazards associated with operating the airplane in severe icing conditions by providing more clearly defined procedures and limitations associated with such conditions...operators must initiate action to notify and ensure that flight crewmembers are apprised of this change...revise the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) by incorporating the following into the Limitation Section of the AFM.  This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM....\"  The airplane was equipped with leading edge deicing boots on the wings, elevators, struts, and had a cargo pod deicing capability.

The helicopter became progressively difficult to control, continuing to roll right and not fully responding to left cyclic control inputs, and the pilot maneuvered to a nearby company loader to land. However, the right rolling tendency continued and the helicopter subsequently collided with terrain.Postaccident examination of the flight control assembly revealed that the gas producer throttle control cable, which is routed adjacent to the connecting linkage push-pull tubes, was entwined with the push-pull tubes. A section of the cable appeared to be pinched between the lower mixing lever unit and the tunnel partition wall. Multiple nylon loop cable clamps, used to secure the throttle cable to the vertical tunnel partition, were broken and separated; however, it was not possible to determine whether the observed damage was the result of the wreckage recovery efforts or a preexisting condition.

The sport pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight which departed Warrenton Fauquier Airport (HWY), Warrenton, Virginia about 1230. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to a witness, when his attention was drawn to the airplane it was in level flight approximately 150 feet above ground level. Thirty seconds later the airplane \"started having engine problems, like it was missing.\" With a model of the airplane in his hand, the witness demonstrated how the airplane completed multiple right-hand orbits at the same altitude. As the airplane completed the third orbit, the engine noise ceased and the airplane descended vertically to a wooded area between two open fields about 4.5 miles northeast of HWY. The wreckage was examined at the accident site, and all major components were accounted for at the scene. The wreckage path was in trees, oriented 254 degrees, and was 40 feet in length. The one-piece wooden propeller was attached to the hub, and both propeller blades of were fragmented outboard of mid-span.Flight control continuity was established from the flight controls to all control surfaces. Aileron control continuity was established through push-pull tube rod end fractures to the ailerons. The fractures demonstrated features consistent with overload.The pilot held a sport pilot certificate with a sport endorsement for airplane single engine land. The certificate limitations were as follows:1. Holder does not meet ICAO requirements.2. Limited to Ercoupe 415 series without rudder pedals. Examination of the pilot's logbook revealed he had logged 157 total hours of flight experience, of which 2 hours were in the accident airplane make and model. Examination further revealed a flight instructor endorsement dated November 23, 2014, for completion of \"3-axis training requirements\". Fuel system continuity was confirmed from the fuel tank, through the fuel filter, to the carburetor bowl. Fuel samples from the filter, carburetor bowl, and fuel tank tested negative for the presence of water. The fuel tank contained about 7 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel. Engine crankshaft and valve train continuity was confirmed by hand rotation of the propeller and confirming rocker arm movement on all valves. Thumb compression was confirmed for each cylinder. The engine was removed from the airplane and each spark plug produced spark when connected to an inline tester while cranking the engine with the starter motor. The engine was test run on scene, using a slave battery to excite the starter. The engine started and ran continuously until the fuel supply was shutoff.",

FAA records indicate that the pilot was advised during each of his weather briefings that VFR flight was not recommended, with AIRMETs for icing and mountain obscuration.  At the time of their departure from Wendover, the mountains to the east and west were obscured.  During the return flight to Salt Lake City, the pilot contacted Flight Watch requesting assistance.  He advised the briefer that he was in instrument conditions, stating that he felt disoriented and thought he was flying upside down.

Radar reconstruction of the event found that AAR204 passed over SWA440 at 200 feet during the go-around.  At the time of the incident, a controller change for the LC2 position had just occurred and the relief controller was responsible for the air traffic control handling of both AAR204 and SWA440.  At 2151:21, the LC2 controller who was being relieved cleared AAR204 to land runway 24L.  At this point, the Boeing 747 was 9.3 miles from the runway.  About 2 minutes later, while AAR204 proceeded inbound on the approach, the LC2 controller provided a relief briefing to the LC2 relief controller and advised him that AAR204 was landing on runway 24L, which the relief controller acknowledged.  After assuming the responsibility of the position, the first transmission from the LC2 relief controller was to SWA440 instructing the flight crew to taxi into position and hold on runway 24L.  AAR204 was 1.81 miles from the runway at 700 feet.  According to the SWA440 captain's statement, he saw the Asiana Boeing 747 on final approach but believed that the aircraft was landing on runway 24R.  Twelve seconds later, the relief controller cleared SWA440 for takeoff.  Radar data indicated AAR204 was 1.26 miles from the runway and about 35 seconds from reaching the landing threshold.  Data retrieved from the SWA440's flight data recorder indicated the airplane was on taxiway V approaching runway 24L when given the takeoff clearance.  This meant that the flight crew had less than 35 seconds to taxi on to runway 24L, begin a departure roll, and travel 6,000 feet before AAR440 crossed the landing threshold, which would be impossible.  According to the Asiana captain's statement, he observed the Southwest Boeing 737 approaching runway 24L but believed the airplane would hold short of the runway.  Once he recognized the aircraft was entering the runway, he initiated a go-around and estimated it was about the time his airplane was passing through 400 feet approaching the runway.The relief controller said that contrary to the recorded relief briefing where he clearly acknowledged that AAR204 was cleared for the left runway, he fully believed AAR204 was landing runway 24R, and therefore, was unaware of the conflict.  He first became aware of the problem when the Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) generated an alarm.  At this point, AAR440 was only about 12 seconds from colliding with SWA440, and without the prompt actions of the Asiana flight crew a collision would have likely occurred.   When the relief controller recognized the problem, he canceled SWA440's takeoff clearance and AAR440's landing clearance.  However, AAR204 had already overflown SWA440 on the go-around, clearing the aircraft by about 200 feet.  Although the relief controller believed AAR204 was landing runway 24R, this did not alleviate his responsibility to properly monitor the operation and ensure separation was maintained.Recorded voice communications of the position relief briefing indicated the LC2 controller informed the relief controller that the inboard runway (RWY 24L) was in use for landings, and that AAR204 was cleared to land on runway 24L.  There was no indication from the relief controller that he did not understand or needed clarification from the relieving controller.  The LC2 controller addressed all major areas on the LAX position relief checklist, and conveyed information accurately during the position relief briefing.   About 30 seconds after the LC2 controller completed the briefing, he remembered additional information about helicopter operations and began relating that to the relief controller; however, this conversation was interrupted by another radio transmission, which effectively distracted both the LC2 controller and relief controller and likely exacerbated the difficulty the relief controller had in converting the briefing information in his short term memory to working memory.  Immediately following the relief briefing, the LC2 controller left the postion.Based on what is known about the volatility of information held in short term memory, and the speed of decay in short term memory without rehearsal of the information, it is not surprising that the relief controller failed to recall every detail LC2 controller's position relief briefing with complete accuracy.  The relief controller was briefed on the location and clearances for seven aircraft (seven pieces of information is about the limit that can be effectively retained short term memory), but was not given sufficient opportunity to rehearse this information in working memory until 13 seconds after the briefing was completed.  The format and timing of the position relief briefing and its interruption by routine radio transmissions contributed to the relief controller's memory error.LAX tower controllers interviewed during the investigation stated that, because of the location of the tower, it was difficult to determine visually whether a single approaching aircraft was lined up for runway 24R or runway 24L.  Controllers stated that destination runways were most difficult to determine visually for large aircraft, such as the Boeing 747.  The LC2 relief controller believed this was the reason he did not recognize the conflict between AAR204 and SWA440.  Although this may be true, it does not alleviate the controller of his responsibility to monitor the operation.  In addition, the relief controller was aware the inboard runways were in use for landings and should have been alert to the possibility of aircraft arriving on runway 24L.  To assist the controllers with visual observations, the LAX tower is equipped with Digital Bright Radar Indicator Terminal Equipment (DBRITE) displays.  The relief controller stated that he saw AAR204's radar target on the DBRITE display during the position relief briefing, but that he did not specifically recall seeing AAR204's data block.  A review of the radar replay indicated AAR204's data block displayed two sets of alternating aircraft information: runway assignment and aircraft type were presented for 5 seconds; followed by a 15-second presentation of altitude and ground speed data.  The relief controller stated that he glanced at his DBRITE display before the runway incursion.  However, he clearly did not perceive the critical information that AAR204 was assigned to land on runway 24L, and he therefore did not take action to eliminate the conflict.  Time-sharing of runway assignment information on the aircraft data tag increased the likelihood that critical information would not be perceived when parallel approaches were being conducted on the north side of the LAX tower.  LAX is equipped with (Airport Movement Area Safety System) AMASS, which is a computer software enhancement to the airport surface detection equipment.  The LAX AMASS at the LC2 position generated an aural and visual alert only 12 seconds before a collision would have occurred, warning the controller to the impeding conflict; however, the flight crew of AAR204 had observed the Southwest Boeing 737 taxing towards the runway and, believing the aircraft was not going to stop, initiated a go-around before the AMASS alert activated.  A collision was avoided, not by AMASS, but by the actions of the flight crew of AAR204.  At the time of the incursion, five certified professional controllers and one operations supervisor were working in the tower cab.  According to facility personnel, there would normally be 10 people available to work on this shift but injuries and illness had reduced the available shift staff to five.  It is common for ATC to combine positions to accommodate facility and/or operational needs.  Controllers routinely work combined positions and are specifically trained to do so.  However, in this situation, the absence of a local assist controller eliminated an additional safety net established to assist local controllers.  The staffing decisions made by the Federal Aviation Administration supervisor on duty at the time of the incursion decreased the likelihood that the relief controller's error would be detected and corrected prior to the runway incursion.In its evaluation of fatigue, the investigation determined that the relief controller had only 8 hours off between the end of his August 18 evening shift at 2330, and the beginning of his morning shift at 0730 on the day of the accident.  As a result, the relief controller reported sleeping just \"5 or 6 hours\" the night before the incursion, and described his shift leading up to the incursion as a \"hard day.\"  This acute sleep loss resulted in a slight decrease in cognitive performance on tasks involving working memory and reaction time.",
            "probable_cause": "a loss of separation between Southwest flight 440 and Asiana flight 204 due to the LC2 relief controller's failure to appropriately monitor the operation and recognize a developing traffic conflict.  Contributing factors included the FAA's position relief briefing procedures, the formatting of the DBRITE radar displays in the LAX tower, controller fatigue, and the tower supervisor's staffing decisions on the day of the incident."

For the flight, despite the presence of drizzle, a tailwind, and obstacles, the pilot elected to use a down-sloping, non-grooved runway with a 41:1 approach slope and a displaced threshold, with an available landing length of 2,377 feet. The pilot executed a go-around after touchdown on his first landing attempt, stating that something did not feel right with the landing. The pilot then attempted another landing, touching down approximately 700 feet down the runway before applying reverse thrust and brakes. Because the runway was wet, the braking action was poor and he realized that he was probably going to overrun the end of the runway. However, he elected not to go around due to the airplane\u2019s low indicated airspeed, the configuration of the airplane, the remaining runway, the rising terrain, and the presence of houses.

The airplane was co-owned, and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The commercial pilot and passenger sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was destroyed during the accident sequence. The local personal flight departed from the El Mirage Lakebed, about 1100. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) had organized an off-duty recreation day at the lakebed. The group was comprised of about 12 people, and included family and friends. A combination of activities was planned, including camping, along with flying both the accident airplane and powered paragliders. The accident pilot was a fire helicopter pilot, assigned to the air operations division of the LAFD.About 0930, the pilot departed with one of his daughters in the accident airplane to perform a sightseeing flight in the local area. The flight departed from the lakebed in a southerly direction in light and variable winds, and lasted about 15 minutes. A short time later he flew his second daughter on a similar flight, for a similar amount of time.For the third, and accident flight, the group requested that the pilot perform a \"low-pass\" over the north shore of the lakebed, where everyone had assembled.According to witnesses, the flight departed again to the south, but this time the wind had picked up such that a left crosswind existed during takeoff. The flight progressed as before, and after about 15 minutes the airplane approached the group from the northwest, at a low altitude for what was presumed to be the low-pass. The airplane flew over the group about 100 feet agl, and after passing initiated a climbing right crosswind turn to the south. Witnesses reported that as the airplane turned from crosswind to downwind, the bank angle became \"excessive,\" with some witnesses assuming the pilot was either positioning the airplane to land, or returning for a second low-pass. The airplane did not level after the bank. The nose then pitched down, and the airplane descended into the ground at a 45-degree nose-down angle.The accident site was located on the western side of the lakebed, at an elevation of 2,841 feet msl. The lakebed was comprised of smooth, hard-packed soil, with the first identified point of impact including a series of 2-inch-deep ground disruptions. Ground scars continued 10-feet further, on a bearing of 320 degrees magnetic, and included debris consisting of green wingtip navigation lens fragments and the nose landing gear strut. The engine starter ring and alternator belt were located adjacent to the scars. The propeller, nose landing gear, shards of red wing tip navigation lens, along with the pitot tube (mounted at the left wingtip, underside) were a further 30-feet down range.The main wreckage came to rest about 160 feet beyond the first impact point. The cabin area rested upright on a bearing of 170 degrees and sustained crush damage from the firewall through to the passenger seat bulkhead. The flight controls were fragmented, and all flight instruments were detached from the panel. The tail section was intact, upright, and undamaged. The engine mount had detached from the airframe, with the engine remaining partially attached to the firewall via control cables and hoses.Both wings had separated from the center spar, and remained loosely oriented perpendicular to the main cabin. The right wing was inverted, with the outboard section of the leading edge crushed at a 45-degree angle towards the trailing edge of the wing tip. The left wing came to rest leading edge up, and sustained leading edge crush damage along its entire length. Both wing spar fuel tanks were breached, and the odor of automotive gasoline was present at the site. The magneto switch was observed in the both position; additionally, the fuel selector valve was in the right wing tank position. The carburetor heat, throttle, and fuel mixture controls were in the full forward position. The flap actuator was set to the fully retracted flap position.All major components of airplane were accounted for at the accident site, and the airframe was free of any indications of bird strike.",
