The Aircraft Accident Report number is NTSB/AAR-14/04On March 15, 2012, about 0740 Atlantic standard time, a Convair CV-440-38, N153JR, operated by Fresh Air, Inc., crashed into a lagoon about 1 mile east of the departure end of runway 10 at Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport (SJU), San Juan, Puerto Rico. The two pilots died, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces. The airplane was operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1251 as a cargo flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and a visual flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight had departed from runway 10 at SJU destined for Princess Juliana International Airport, St. Maarten. Shortly after takeoff, the first officer declared an emergency, and then the captain requested a left turn back to SJU and asked the local air traffic controllers if they could see smoke coming from the airplane (the two tower controllers noted in postaccident interviews that they did not see more smoke than usual coming from the airplane). The controllers cleared the flight to land on runway 28, but as the airplane began to align with the runway, it crashed into a nearby lagoon (Laguna La Torrecilla).",

The airplane taxied from parking at the terminal building to runway 36 and took off without a clearance from ground or local control.  Both controllers attempted to stop the airplane by using a red light gun signal control; however, the airplane did not stop.  The controllers did not see the airplane stop in the run-up area.  Other witnesses, including an FAA airworthiness inspector reported that just beyond the departure end of the 5,000-foot-long runway, the airplane began a tight left turn, as if attempting to return to the runway.  The left bank continued to increase until the nose dropped and the airplane descended vertically to ground impact, about 1,000 feet from the approach end of runway 18.  The FAA inspector saw a trail of smoke coming from the airplane during the initial climb.  The pilot ordered the fuel about 1 hour prior to takeoff and supervised the process; 15 gallons were put in each tip tank and none was added to the main tank.  No determination could be made as to the quantity in the main tank at departure.  The pilot pointed out two empty oil cans laying on the ground by the airplane's nose and asked the refueler if he could throw them away for him.  The refueler did not observe the pilot placing the oil in the engine or complete any other aspect of a preflight inspection.  The pilot, who is an A & P, performed all maintenance activities on the aircraft.  Notations in the maintenance records show an unresolved 1-pint per hour oil consumption rate over the last 10 months.  The pilot's personal flight logbook reflected that between 1989 and the date of the accident, the pilot had flown 100 hours total, all in the accident airplane.  The most recent 6 months of activity consisted of three flights in April, two flights in May, and two flights in July.  The aircraft fuel system consists of a main fuselage tank (which extends into the root area of each wing), and a left and right tip tank.  The main tank has a capacity of 39 gallons, and each tip tank has a 34-gallon capacity.  The normal operating procedures section of the pilot operating handbook states that for starting, takeoff and climb, the fuel selector should be selected to the main tank, and that the electric fuel boost pump be used for takeoff and when switching fuel tanks.  No hydraulic deformation was noted to the ruptured main fuel tank, and no fuel was found in the tank.  The vent lines and ports for all three fuel tanks were clear and unobstructed.  The fuel selector was visually examined by looking in the ports for each of the tanks.  The ball cock opening was found positioned between the main tank and the left tip tank; the opening was about 40 percent open to the left tip and about 10 percent open to the main tank.  The electric fuel boost pump switch was in the OFF position.  The fuel gages showed 3/4 full for both tip tanks and 9 gallons for the main tank.  The avionics master switch was in the OFF position.  The No. 1 communications radio was selected to 125.1 (the local control frequency), while the No. 2 communications radio was on 121.1.  For the audio control panel, the transmitter was selected to the No. 1 communications radio and the speaker was selected to the No. 2 communications radio.  Borescope examination of the cylinder interiors revealed deposits of rust on the cylinder walls.  No other preimpact anomaly was found during an examination of the engine or the airframe systems.",

The flight crew was unable to retract the landing gear after takeoff.  They received the  L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT and AUTO FLT A/THR OFF messages on the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) system.  In addition, they had a Nose Wheel Steering message on the landing gear ECAM page.  Unable to rectify the problem, the captain elected to return to land at ORD.  The captain reported that he did not have any problem controlling the airplane during the landing.  During the landing roll, he was informed by the control tower that there were sparks coming from the nose gear.  The airplane stopped on the runway and the passengers were deplaned.  Post-incident inspection revealed the nose landing gear (NLG) wheels were turned 90 degrees to the left, both of the tires were blown, and the left side tire rim was ground down to the axle.  The right side tire rim was nearly ground down to the axle.  The incident occurred on the fourth flight following a maintenance \"C\" check where the dynamic seals inside the nose landing gear (NLG) shock absorber had been replaced.  The maintenance was performed by a contract facility.   Inspection and teardown of the nose gear revealed the shock absorber had been assembled and installed in the airplane incorrectly during the C-check.  This resulted in the anti-rotation lugs on the shock absorber, not being properly seated in the back plate slots.

The flight crew failed to brief or review the instrument approach procedure prior to takeoff and exhibited various cognitive task deficiencies during the approach.  These cognitive task deficiencies included selection of the wrong frequency for pilot controlled lighting, concluding that the airport was obscured by clouds despite weather information to the contrary, stating inaccurate information regarding instrument approach headings and descent altitudes, and descending below appropriate altitudes during the approach.  This resulted in the crew's lack of awareness regarding terrain in the approach path.  Pilots approaching a runway over a dark featureless terrain may experience an illusion that the airplane is at a higher altitude that it actually is.  In response to this illusion, referred to as the featureless terrain illusion or black hole phenomenon, a pilot may fly a lower than normal approach potentially compromising terrain clearance requirements.  The dark visual scene on the approach path and the absence of a visual glideslope indicator were conducive to producing a false perception that the airplane was at a higher altitude.  A ground proximity warning device may have alerted the crew prior to impact.  However, the amount of advanced warning that may have been provided by such a device was not determined.  Although the flight crew's performance was consistent with fatigue-related impairment, based on available information, the Safety Board staff was unable to determine to what extent the cognitive task deficiencies exhibited by the flight crew were attributable to fatigue and decreased alertness.",

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed from Sabot Airport (1VA0), Sabot, Virginia, at 0850, and was destined for Rocky Mount-Wilson Regional Airport (RWI), Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to preliminary air traffic control (ATC) voice and radar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, the airplane departed from 1VA0 and climbed to 4,000 feet.  About 0930, the pilot advised ATC of equipment issues and requested a diversion to Hanover County Municipal Airport (OFP), Ashland, Virginia.  About 5 minutes later, the pilot reported an engine issue and requested another diversion to Halifax-Northampton Regional Airport (IXA), Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina.  Shortly thereafter, the pilot reported that he would perform a forced landing to a field.  No further communications were received and the airplane was located by first responders about 1050.  The initial impact point was located in an open, furrowed cotton field and was comprised of a set of three tracks consistent with the airplane's landing gear.  The tracks extended about 30 feet on a 110-degree magnetic heading.  A ground scar and the airplane's separated nose landing gear were located at the termination of the tracks.

Witnesses observed the airplane flying along the beach about 100 yards offshore in a northerly direction, descending from approximately 300 feet to approximately 50 feet above the water. It next entered a very abrupt and steep turn to the northeast, then went straight up while continuing to turn until it rolled out on a westerly heading toward a cluster of condominiums that lined the beach. The airplane once again made a sharp turn to the right (northbound), then pitched up sharply until it was upside down. It then pitched down, rolled about its longitudinal axis, and impacted the water nose first. A postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction of the airplane or engine. Both the Federal Aviation Administration and the International Aerobatic Club consider the minimum altitude for aerobatic maneuvers to be 1,500 feet, which the pilot was well below when he commenced the maneuvers. Examination of a landing gear down light bulb revealed filament stretching, which indicated that the light bulb was energized prior to the airplane's impact with the water. Review of photographs taken of the airplane a few minutes prior to the accident and moments before it impacted the water, confirmed that the landing gear was extended. Review of the airplane\u2019s pilot operating handbook revealed that the landing gear was supposed to be raised after takeoff and that the pilot was supposed to check for a landing gear up indication. The extended landing gear would have affected the airplane's performance and would have made the airplane slower to respond to the pilot's inputs.

After image effects also induced a blind condition in his left eye.  He said the total inability to see lasted 30 seconds, and for an additional 2 minutes, he could not focus on or interpret any instrument indications and was completely disoriented in his spatial relationship to the vertical.  The captain was not irradiated by the beam and assumed control of the aircraft and continued the climb.  Many of the larger hotels in Las Vegas have some sort of outdoor laser light show.  Most of these installations have both fixed/stationary (static) beams of relatively high power and 'dancing' beams of lower power which flash about the sky in irregular patterns. Recorded radar data was used to perform a trajectory and vehicle attitude study to determine the relative position of resorts with laser shows to the position and orientation of the aircraft.  As the aircraft passed through 7,000 feet, the positions of three resorts relative to the aircraft were all located in the clear vision field of view of the first officer, and at a position of less than 90 degrees relative azimuth from the first officer's eye reference point.  One had the shortest three dimensional distance to the aircraft at 4.7 nautical miles, while the other two were at three dimensional distances of about 7 nautical miles.  The source of the laser could not be established with certainty. Fifty-one prior incidents of laser irradiations to pilots have been recorded by the Las Vegas air traffic facility over the past 2 years.  FAA Order 7400.2D in effect at the time contains guidelines for FAA personnel in the approval process for determination of whether a proposed outdoor laser light display is compatible with navigable airspace.  The order defines two areas: the Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD); and the Eye Safe Distance (ESD).  NOHD is defined as the distance from the point source where the irradiance level in power and area footprint can cause permanent thermal damage to the retina.  ESD encompasses all other irradiance exposures where biological damage to the eye should not occur.  Approval requires only that the laser beam be classed as ESD in navigable airspace.   The approval process does not consider such laser exposure effects as flashblindness, afterimage, startle, and high glare conditions on pilot performance. ",
            "probable_cause": "The flying pilot's inadvertent exposure to an unidentified ground-based laser beam.  A factor in the incident is the lack of appropriate standards by the FAA and FDA for laser light exposure levels to aircrew in navigable airspace. "

The pilot and two passengers sustained fatal injuries. The aircraft was registered to ARC Aviation LLC and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Marginal visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was not on a flight plan. The flight originated about 2235 from the Midway International Airport (MDW), Chicago, Illinois, and was en route to the Lawrence Municipal Airport, Lawrence, Kansas.Preliminary radar track information showed that the airplane departed runway 22L at MDW and began climbing on runway heading (220 degrees). When the airplane had reached an altitude of about 2,200 feet above mean sea level (msl), it turned about 30 degrees to the left to a heading of about 190 degrees and began descending. During the descent, the airplane then turned to the right to a heading of about 260 degrees. During the right turn the airplane descended to about 1500 feet msl and then started to climb. During this period, the airplane entered a left turn which continued for about 360 degrees before radar contact was lost. The final recorded altitude was about 2,000 feet msl.At 2238, the weather conditions at MDW were: wind 170 degrees at 9 knots; 6 statute miles visibility; mist; a broken ceiling at 1,000 feet above ground level (agl); an overcast ceiling at 1,400 feet agl; temperature 15 degrees Celsius; dew point 13 degrees Celsius; altimeter setting 29.89 inches of mercury. The field elevation at MDW was 620 feet msl.The accident location was in a residential area about 6 nautical miles southwest of MDW. The initial impact point was within a group of trees. Broken limbs and the condition of the wreckage was consistent with a near vertical attitude at impact. The majority of the wreckage remained at the initial impact point while smaller pieces of wreckage were spread in a fan shaped pattern to the southeast. All major airframe components were located and identified within the wreckage debris path. The entire airplane exhibited severe crushing and fragmentation of all components.

While on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, the CFI configured the helicopter to an airspeed of 60 knots (kts) with the hydraulics turned off.  As he maneuvered the helicopter onto final approach, the cyclic became stiff, with increasing force required to manipulate it.  The control forces on the cyclic were becoming increasing harder to overcome and difficult to move, while the collective remained in the neutral position.  The CFI was trying to hold the cyclic in the forward right position and was using a large amount of physical force to do so.  As the helicopter slowed it began to drift to the left of the intended approach site and the CFI attempted to move the cyclic to correct the drift, but could move the control due to the stiffness.  He attempted to accelerate and instructed the second pilot to restore the hydraulics, knowing that only the collective for the right-seated pilot had the hydraulics switch.  The second pilot never restored the hydraulics.  Seconds later the helicopter climbed to about 20 feet above ground level (agl) and the CFI had no control. The helicopter rolled to the left and impacted terrain. A review of the flight manuals revealed that the pilots followed the proper procedures to perform a practice hydraulic-off emergency procedure and maintained the correct airspeeds.  The second pilot stated that he never turned the hydraulics back on because he recalled a warning in training that doing so at such a low altitude could result in the pilot unintentionally over-controlling the cyclic and the helicopter crashing.  Anecdotally the Safety Board is aware of other pilots that share the same belief; however, the Rotorcraft Flight Manual does not specifically address the issue.  An examination of the wreckage disclosed that the left lateral hydraulic servo was rigged out of limits (0.106 inches), though the helicopter's manufacturer stated that the anomaly would not have a noticeable affect in the capabilities or handling of the helicopter.  The servo accumulators were examined and tested.  Upon disassembly of the longitudinal servo, investigators observed that the liner exhibited a bulging area about 1 inch from the end, similar to mushroomed deformation.  The piston was removed from the liner revealing that about 1/2 of the Teflon white piston pad was displaced from the piston seal groove.  The anomaly could not be definitively attributed to a preimpact condition.  Additionally, in spite of extensive analysis by the manufacturer, the significance of the anomaly is not yet fully understood at this time.",

The airplane veered sharply to the left, continued off the left side of the runway and down an embankment. The airplane's right wing struck the ground and sustained structural damage.  A postaccident inspection revealed that a 6-inch section of the aluminum hydraulic brake line tubing, which is covered by the right main landing gear's fiberglass fairing assembly, had chafed through about mid-span between the fuselage and right wheel assembly.  Additionally, no hydraulic brake fluid was found in the right hydraulic brake reservoir.  Prior to the accident, and in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended inspection intervals, the operator would remove the fiberglass fairing assembly and inspect the aluminum hydraulic brake line tubing every 400 hours, or during the airplane's annual inspection.  As a result of the accident, and due to the high hourly utilization of the rental/instruction airplanes in the operator's fleet, the operator now removes the fiberglass fairing assembly to inspect the aluminum hydraulic brake line tubing during each 100-hour inspection.

No preimpact mechanical anomalies of the engine were noted; however, examination of the muffler assembly revealed that the right internal baffle cone had separated from the surrounding structure. It was possible for the separated baffle cone to partially block the exhaust exit; however, its position as found would not have resulted in a loss of engine power. The airplane had been operated for about 2 hours since its most recent annual inspection, which was performed about 5 months prior to the accident. Due to the amount of damage observed to the fracture surfaces of the baffle cone, it was likely that the fracture occurred prior to the annual inspection.

Because of the high density of aircraft operations during the fly-in, the Federal Aviation Administration implemented special air traffic control procedures to accommodate traffic demand and maximize runway capacity. Arriving aircraft were issued landing instructions and clearances by a tower controller using a specified tower radio frequency. Departing aircraft were handled by another team of controllers operating on a separate radio frequency that was associated with a mobile operations unit located near the runway.Air traffic control data indicated that the accident airplane established contact with the tower controller and entered a left traffic pattern for runway 18R. As the accident airplane was turning from downwind to base leg, the controller handling departures cleared a Piper Cub for an immediate takeoff and angled departure (a procedure used by slower aircraft to clear the runway immediately after liftoff by turning across the runway edge). The accident pilot was not monitoring the departure frequency, and, therefore, he did not hear the radio transmissions indicating that the departing Piper Cub was going to offset to the left of the runway after liftoff. The accident pilot reported that, while on base leg, he became concerned that his descent path to the runway would conflict with the Piper Cub that was on takeoff roll. He stated that he overshot the runway centerline during his turn from base to final, and, when he completed the turn, his airplane was offset to the right of the runway. The pilot stated that, at this point, he decided not to land because of a perceived conflict with the departing Piper Cub that was ahead and to the left of his position. The pilot reported that he initiated a go-around, increasing engine power slightly, but not to takeoff power, as he looked for additional traffic to avoid. He estimated that he advanced the throttle levers \"probably a third of the way to the stop,\" and, as he looked for traffic, the stall warning stick-shaker and stick-pusher systems activated almost simultaneously as the right wing stalled. The airplane subsequently collided with terrain in a nose down, right wing low attitude.A postaccident review of available air traffic control communications, amateur video of the accident sequence, controller and witness statements, and position data recovered from the accident airplane indicated that the Piper Cub was already airborne, had turned left, and was clear of runway 18R when the accident airplane turned from base to final.The postaccident examination did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. The airplane flight manual states that, in the event of a go-around, the pilot should first advance engine thrust to takeoff power and then establish Vref (reference landing approach speed). The pilot's decision not to select takeoff power during the go-around directly contributed to the development of the aerodynamic stall at a low altitude.",

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was being operated in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and a flight plan was not filed.  The pilot reportedly departed SLE on the local flight about an hour prior to the accident.The tower controller reported that just past 0800, the pilot called inbound for landing from the south and was given a clearance to land to the north.  The controller stated that the approach appeared normal, and that the landing gear appeared to be \"down and in place\".  Additionally, the controller reported that the airplane \"floated\" down the runway for approximately 1,000 feet, and at mid-field began a shallow climb at a low airspeed, ascending to about 100 feet above ground level (agl) by the time it reached the departure end of the runway.  The airplane then began a left turn, followed by a loss of control and impact with terrain.Other witnesses reported observing the airplane attempt to climb at a low airspeed, reaching an altitude of about 100 feet agl with its landing gear and flaps retracted; however, the engine sounded as if it were at a low rpm and misfiring.  Shortly thereafter, the airplane was observed making a gradual left turn, which was followed by an increasing bank angle to the left, as it appeared the airplane was attempting to return to the runway prior to impact with terrain.An initial survey of the accident site by National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration investigators revealed that the wreckage was confined to an area which measured 72 feet in length by 48 feet in width.

The CFI began a turn back to the departure airport, and declared an emergency to the air traffic control tower. The CFI, in the rear seat, and without access to the electrical switches or circuit breakers, asked the student in the front seat to \"turn everything off except the radio.\" After they received clearance to return to the airport, the CFI asked the student to turn off the radio; the student turned off the radio and the master switch. Shortly thereafter, the CFI instructed the student to turn on the master switch and radio, but \"they would not work,\" and when the student cycled the master switch, the engine ceased operation. The CFI stated that due to the low altitude at the time of the power loss, he focused on landing safely, and did not attempt to troubleshoot the situation or verify the student pilot's actions. The airplane landed uneventfully on a road. Post-incident examination and testing revealed that the main fuse block for the airplane's electrical system exhibited intermittent contact, which, due to the architecture of the electrical system, caused the airplane system voltage to peak at values 5 to 8 volts above the normal value of 12 volts. The over-voltage condition resulted in overheating and thermal damage to an avionics cooling fan. The fuse block was not intended for aviation applications, and was installed without a positive locking mechanism for the fuse retainer. After the incident, the airplane manufacturer issued a service bulletin that recommended safety-wiring the main fuse block fuse retainer in the closed position, and also incorporated that change into the production line. No electrical or mechanical mechanism that related the fuse block malfunction or the over-voltage condition to engine operation or failure was identified. After the fuse block and damaged cooling fan were replaced with new units, the incident airplane and engine functioned normally.

(TWA) flight 800, a Boeing 747-131, N93119, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York. TWA flight 800 was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled international passenger flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York, New York, to Charles DeGaulle International Airport, Paris, France.  The flight departed JFK about 2019, with 2 pilots, 2 flight engineers, 14 flight attendants, and 212 passengers on board.  All 230 people on board were killed, and the airplane was destroyed.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan.  The investigation revealed that the crash occurred as the result of a fuel/air explosion in the airplane's center wing fuel tank (CWT) and the subsequent in-flight breakup of the airplane.  The investigation further revealed that the ignition energy for the CWT explosion most likely entered the CWT through the fuel quantity indication system wiring; neither the ignition energy release mechanism nor the location of the ignition inside the CWT could be determined from the available evidence.  There was no evidence of a missile or bomb detonation.  For more information please see National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Report NTSB/AAR-00/03. ",
            "probable_cause": "An explosion of the center wing fuel tank (CWT), resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank.  The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the CWT that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.      Contributing factors to the accident were the design and certification concept that fuel tank explosions could be prevented solely by precluding all ignition sources and the design and certification of the Boeing 747 with heat sources located beneath the CWT with no means to reduce the heat transferred into the CWT or to render the fuel vapor in the tank nonflammable.

The pilot subsequently advised the pilot of the other airplane that the wind had become stronger and was affecting his airplane\u2019s controllability. He added that he might attempt to land or consider returning to the departure airport. Shortly thereafter, the airplane made a descending right turn and impacted the ground. An examination of the wreckage revealed that the airplane was equipped with a nonstandard, smaller wing and was trimmed to the near full nose-down position, which would increase the airplane\u2019s stall speed. According to the wing manufacturer, the nonstandard wing has controllability problems at high speeds. Surface weather observations reported wind gusting to 22 knots near the time of the accident. The combination of the nonstandard wing, which reduced controllability, the full nose-down trim, which increased the stall speed, and the high wind gusts resulted in the pilot\u2019s failure to maintain control of the airplane.  Postmortem toxicological testing of specimens from the pilot indicated the recent use of marijuana. Although the levels were such that the use may have been impairing, the actual effects on the flight could not be determined.    ",

Since the pilot was not familiar with the destination airport, the pilot requested and was given radar vectors. Approach control informed the pilot when established on the localizer he was cleared for the ILS runway 5L approach.  After multiple attempts to land at the Raleigh-Durham Airport, approach control provided the pilot with visual flight rules alternatives to the Greensboro and Winston-Salem Airports.  The pilot requested to attempt another approach, and on the final attempt approach control lost radio and radar contact with the airplane.  At 1545 the Wake County rescue located the downed airplane approximately 5-miles south of the Raleigh-Durham Airport in a small lake in an apartment complex. The debris from the airplane sank in the water on the northwest side of the lake in approximately 8 feet of water.  Witnesses at the crash site reported seeing the airplane come in at a shallow angle turned sideways. The airplane collided with trees and then the lake. Examination of the wreckage site revealed freshly broken trees at the beginning of the wreckage path. Approximately 300 feet from the first broken tree there was another tree with freshly broken branches, and a ground scar along the shoreline of a small lake.

Although the captain's windscreen was partially covered with ice, he could still see the runway, so he took control of the airplane and continued the approach. The flight crew then confirmed that the windscreen heating and alcohol anti-ice systems were on. As the airplane passed over the runway threshold, the captain's windscreen abruptly iced over, and he had no forward visibility as the airplane's main landing gear wheels touched down. Unable to see the runway ahead and with limited visibility to each side, the flight crew attempted to activate the engine thrust reversers to slow the landing roll, but the airplane subsequently veered to the right of the runway centerline, and the right wing collided with a snow berm. The pilots reported no preincident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. About 15 minutes before the incident, the approach controller at an airport about 7 miles northeast of the incident airport advised the destination airport's north radar position controller that the pilot of another airplane had reported that he was \"going around\" due to severe icing on the airplane's canopy. No record was found indicating that this pilot report (PIREP) was relayed to the incident flight crew or other aircraft operating near the incident airport. Both airports are under the control of the same approach control facility. The meteorological conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to a very light freezing or frozen precipitation environment very close to or at the surface. Therefore, it is likely that the airplane encountered significant in-flight icing conditions during the approach and landing that exceeded the capabilities of the airplane's anti-ice systems. In addition, if the pilots had been made aware of the severe icing PIREP from the nearby airport, they likely would have had other options available for landing.

As a result, a logbook entry was made, and inspection of the airplane revealed damage due to contact between the elevator and rudder.  Examination of the elevator gust lock mechanism revealed that only three of four elevator stop bumpers were installed.  The upper right bumper was missing, but the mount bolt was still in place.  The upper left bumper was cracked, chipped, crazed, and displayed a longitudinal crack that ran its entire length.  FDR data showed that when the airplane taxied onto the departure runway for the previous flight, the gust lock was released, and rapid deflection of the elevator control surfaces and the control yoke was noted.  At the point where the control yoke returned to its nominal position, the LH and RH elevator graph lines were approximately 4 degrees apart.  These lines remained separated by approximately 4 degrees throughout the remainder of the flight.  Examination of prior flights revealed the elevator control surface graph lines were superimposed in all modes of flight.  Winds at the departure airport were from 300 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 27 knots.

The ground marshaller was standing such that the left wingtip would clear him by 18 inches. The marshaller, who was facing east, began waving his wands and back stepping to the west. As the marshaller was positioned at the airplanes 10:30 position, he, the marshaller, turned 180 degrees toward the west and bent down from the waist. His back was toward the wing and his face was down toward the pavement. The marshaller continued walking toward the west and turned his head to face another marshaller. The pilot turned to face the direction the airplane was taxing. He then heard a loud bang and the airplane rotated to the left about 15 degrees.

            "narrative": "History of FlightOn April 11, 2011, about 2006 EDT, an Airbus A380, F-HPJD, collided with a Bombardier CRJ 701, N641CA, while the Airbus was taxiing for takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Jamaica, New York.  At the time of the accident, the CRJ was stationary with part of the airplane on the Comair/Delta parking ramp and its tail extended onto \u201cMike\u201d taxiway.  The CRJ was waiting for ramp clearance to its parking spot. The A380 was carrying 485 passengers and 25 crewmembers, and none were injured. The CRJ was carrying 62 passengers and 4 crewmembers, and none were injured.  Both the Airbus and the CRJ sustained substantial damage.The Airbus was registered to and operated by Air France, and operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 129.  The CRJ was registered to and operated by Comair, Inc., and was operating under the provisions of Code of Federal Regulations Part 121.  The CRJ had departed Logan International Airport (BOS), Massachusetts, earlier in the evening and landed on runway 22L at JFK.  After being cleared to cross runway 22R, the flightcrew was told by air traffic control (ATC) to taxi to the Comair/Delta ramp via taxiway Bravo and taxiway Mike.  As the Comair airplane was approaching taxiway Mike, the first officer contacted the Delta ramp controller  who advised the airplane to hold at Diamond 2, which was a painted spot on the ramp.  The CRJ taxied into the ramp area and stopped with its nose landing gear on the Diamond 2 spot.  In this stationary positionthe Comair airplane\u2019s tail extended across a roadway located next to the ramp and onto taxiway Mike.  The ramp area and associated taxiway where the Comair airplane was parked at Diamond 2 was not visible from the control tower and the Comair crew did not advise ATC that they had not cleared the taxiway.While the Comair airplane was taxiing to its ramp, the Air France Airbus A380 was being pushed back from its gate on the ramp adjacent to the Comair/Delta ramp.  The crew of the A380 started its engines and contacted ATC for a taxi clearance to Runway 22R.  ATC advised the Air France crew to turn left on taxiway Alpha and to hold short of taxiway Echo.  The A380 exited its ramp via taxiway Mike Alpha and began a left turn onto taxiway Alpha.  At approximately 20:06:25, the A380 completed its turn and was established on the centerline of the taxiway with a groundspeed of about 8 knots.  The right seat captain said he checked the nose wheel camera display to be sure the nosewheel was on the centerline of the taxiways.  Approximately 2 to 3 seconds later, ATC advised the A380 to give way to opposite direction traffic at taxiway Kilo Delta.  The right seat captain, who was controlling the A380, stated that he did not look at his taxi map because he knew the Kilo Delta intersection was \u201cat the end of Alpha [taxiway]\u201d.  The left seat captain stated that he knew where the intersection was located but looked momentarily at his taxi chart.  Approximately fifteen seconds after being established on taxiway Alpha, the Air France airplane\u2019s left wingtip collided with the tail section of the Comair airplane.  Both the right and left seat captains stated that they never saw the Comair airplane before the collision.  Both pilots indicated they had difficulty seeing clearly outside the A-380 cockpit due to lights from the airport terminal, ground traffic and other airplanes.  The right seat captain said he only looked forward outside the cockpit, not sideways.  He said there were a lot of lights and flashes of light on the roadway to his left so he did not look toward the roadway.  He said terminal and vehicle lights bothered him if he looked 20 degrees left.The pilots of the Comair airplane stated that they noticed the Air France A-380 as it taxied out of its ramp.  The captain said that when he noticed the A-380 was on taxiway Alpha, he decided to move his airplane forward a few feet to give the A-380 some more room.  After moving forward, he stopped the airplane and reset the parking brake.  He said he thought the A-380 would be able to pass behind him.  After the A-380 collided with them, the Comair CRJ crew decided to evacuate the airplane.  All passengers and the crew evacuated through the main cabin door.  InjuriesNone of the passengers or crewmembers in either airplane were injured.Damage to AirplanesThe outer part of the left wing\u2019s leading edge of the Airbus was substantially damaged by the impact and the top part of the left winglet was sheared off.  The CRJ sustained substantial damage to its left horizontal stabilizer and rudder.Personnel InformationAircraft InformationThe Bombardier CRJ 701 is 106 feet, 8 inches long.  The Airbus A380 is 261 feet, 6 inches wide.  A Boeing 747-800, the next widest aircraft utilizing JFK taxiways, is 224 feet 7 inches wide.Regarding visibility from the A380 cockpit, the pilots, when sitting in the correct position, are about 23 feet, 7 inches, above ground and can see the ground from about 69 feet in front of the aircraft. Cockpit window pillars are partially blocking the pilot\u2019s view. When in the left seat, a 10\u00b0-wide blind area is situated approximately 40\u00b0 to the left. The outline of the nose cone, the windshield and the side window panels were designed to obtain an outside visibility comparable to that of all modern aircraft. The visibility is greater than that defined by the Aerospace Standard: AS 580 B.An A380 binocular vision diagram revealed that when sitting in left seat in the \u201cnormal\u201d position (i.e. 0\u00b0 vertically), there is an area between about 38\u00b0 and 48\u00b0 to the left where neither the left nor the right eye can see.Meteorological InformationAt 1951 EDT, the visibility was measured at 7 statute miles, with a few clouds at 10,000 feet and a broken ceiling at 25,000 feet. Sunset was at 1931 EDT. Aids to NavigationThe Airbus was equipped with an Onboard Airport Navigation System (ONAS)that dynamically presented a display of the airplane position on an airport moving map display in the cockpit.  This display could be seen on either pilot\u2019s Navigation Display (ND) located on his instrument panel.  The OANS display did not have the capability to display other airplanes, ground vehicles, or other obstructions. The Airbus is also equipped with an External Taxi Aid Camera System (ETACS) consisting of two video cameras designed to assist the flight crew by displaying the nose and main gear positions before and during taxi.  The Belly Taxi Aid Camera System (BTACS) was located on the underside of the fuselage just aft of the nosewheel.  It displayed a picture of the nosewheel and the taxiway and was used by the pilots to verify that they were on a taxiway centerline or the condition of the nosewheel.The Fin Taxi Aid Camera (FTAC) was located on the vertical tail and displayed a view of the airplane.  The Fin Camera view extended from just outside the number one outboard engine to just outside the number four outboard engine. The Fin Camera did not display the airplane wingtips.  The Fin Camera projected a visual indicator to show the location of the outer edge of each of the main landing gears.The wingtips do not appear on either of the camera views and neither of the ETACS cameras had the capability of recording.And last, Air France had a specific A380 taxi chart for JFK airport that indicated the approved routes for taxi.  At the time of the accident, the A-380 accident airplane was using an approved route.CommunicationsAlthough the Airbus pilots stated that the ground control frequency was very busy, this communication difficulty did not affect the accident sequence of events.Airport InformationAccording to air traffic control personnel, the diamond markings on the Delta parking ramp were meant to be hold points for departing airplanes taxiing out to taxiway Alpha, via taxiway Mike.  They were not intended to be hold points for airplanes taxiing into the parking ramp after flight.  In addition, the diamond markings are labeled \"Aircraft Start Up\" on Comair Jeppesen Plate 20-0C.  An examination of historical aerial photography of the ramp revealed that the markings were applied sometime between November 24, 2006, and July 7, 2007.  The investigation could not determine when Comair airplanes first began using the diamonds as stop points inbound to the ramp, prior to parking.  The JFK airport Operational Plan for the Airbus A380 movement (dated July 1, 2008) has been developed in accordance with Modifications of Standards (MOS) submitted by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). It was subsequently conditionally approved by the FAA for A380 operations at JFK. The conditions of acceptance of the MOS included operational restrictions that are required under certain conditions. These operational restrictions established for A380 operations at JFK include:\u2022 Departures from Runway 13L are not permitted. Taxiway obstructions prohibit the ground maneuverability of the aircraft.\u2022 Departures from Runway 31R are not permitted. Taxiway obstructions prohibit the ground maneuverability of the aircraft if a departure is aborted.\u2022 Parallel Taxiways \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018Q\u2019 are prohibited from simultaneous A380 operations\u2022 Taxiway \u2018B\u2019 is restricted from normal A380 operations. \u2022 South Bridges (Van Wyck Expressway) restrictions \u2013 See red area in the figure below. A380 must cross bridges alone. All simultaneous aircraft crossings with an A380 are prohibited. JFK \u2013 ATCT will instruct aircraft to hold at the intersections prior to the bridge. Aircraft traveling North will be held prior to the intersection with Taxiway \u2018NA\u2019. Aircraft traveling South will be held prior to the intersection with Taxiway \u2018NB\u2019. Intermediate Holding Position Markings will identify this holding point on the taxiways.\u2022 An A380 must be established on the centerline of Taxiways A, B, C, K, P, U, YA or ZA, in order to be considered clear of the parallel runway.The Operational Plan identifies the preferred taxiing routes based on these restrictions.Flight RecordersMedical and Pathological InformationTests and ResearchCalculations revealed that if an A380 is on taxiway A with its nose wheel on the centerline and a CRJ701 is on taxiway M perpendicular to taxiway A with its nose wheel on \u201cdiamond 2\u201d, then there is an overlap between the wingtip of the A380 and the tail of the CRJ700. This overlap is about 16 feet long. A motion study, in the form of an animation, produced by the BEA depicted the relative positions of the two aircraft on taxiways A and M. The motion study was based on the FDR parameters of the A380 and assumes a still position of the CRJ on \u201cdiamond 2\u201d. The audio track of the GND frequency of JFK ATCT was synchronized with the FDR data. A 10\u00b0-wide cone to the left of the A380 cockpit represented the area blocked by the window pillar when the pilot sitting on the left seat is in the normal position.The motion study showed that the CRJ701 was in the cone area during the end of the turn of the A380 on taxiway A (from 2006:10 until 2006:20). The CRJ700 was fully out of the cone from 2006:26. One second later, the local controller instructed the A380 crew to give way to an opposite traffic about 3300 feet ahead. The collision occurred 15 seconds later, right after the A380 crew finished acknowledging the local controler instruction. \t Additional Information14 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1 \u2013 Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, Subchapter F - Air Traffic and General Operating Rules, Part 91 \u2013 General Operating and Flight Rules, subpart 91-113 \u2013 Right-of-way Rules, (b) - General stated in part: \u201c\u2026..vigilance shall be maintained by each person operating an aircraft so as to see and avoid other aircraft.\u201dThe FAA Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), dated August 25, 2011, Chapter 2 - Aeronautical Lighting and Other Visual Aids, section 3 \u2013 Airport Marking Aids and Signs, sub-section 2-3-4 \u2013 Taxiway Centerline, (b.)-Taxiway Centerline, (1.)
