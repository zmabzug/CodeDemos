During the briefing, the pilot was advised of forecast IFR conditions, with ceilings occasionally less than 1,000 feet and 3 miles visibility.  Airmets advised mountain obscuration with scattered moderate to heavy rain.  The FSS briefer concluded that after 1900-2000, the weather was going to reduce conditions to marginal VFR flight conditions.  When the pilot opened his VFR flight plan by radio the briefer again asked him if he had the airmet for mountain obscuration, IFR conditions, and current information for the route.  The pilot said yes he did and the briefer concluded by telling the pilot that VFR flight was not recommended.  After the pilot arrived at Livermore airport he was asked by the local controller if he had a clearance on file or if he'd like to file one before he departed Livermore, and the pilot declined.  The accident site was located between the elevation of 1,900 to 2,000 feet msl on a route consistent with a downwind departure from Livermore.  A weather study by the Safety Board found that the airplane most likely experienced light to moderate rain after takeoff, with the airplane encountering heavy to very heavy rain near the accident site. Witnesses who were in the vicinity of the accident location confirmed that it was raining heavily near the accident timeframe. ",

The captain was hand flying the airplane in the initial takeoff climb, and selected landing gear up passing through 300 to 500 feet above ground level (agl).  The red \"doors\" light illuminated on the front panel and the amber right main gear door light illuminated on the second officer's panel.  All attempts to lower the right main gear were unsuccessful, so the captain elected to return to the airport and land with the right main gear extended about 15 degrees.  Inspection of the right main landing gear revealed that the safety bar bent down about 20 degrees at the leading edge and 15 degrees at its midpoint.  The safety bar's inboard flanges buckled just below the reinforced area.  The inner gear door drive rod bent aft about 15 degrees at the upper attachment fitting, and the tube buckled and separated below the four attachment nuts.  The outboard section of the clamshell gear door sustained mechanical damage.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the door rods were not loose, and all were in good condition.  A general inspection of the wheel well revealed no other damage.  There was no abnormal wear or movement marks on the up-lock hook, and the hook was properly adjusted.  The actuator adjustor plate was properly installed.  Delta maintenance technicians installed new clamshell door halves and a new drive rod.  They serviced the strut, isolated the right main clamshell gear door, and cycled the gear.  Then they cycled the right main wheel with the door.  Finally, they cycled all of the landing gear together.  All wheels and doors cycled in proper sequence.  Metallurgical examination discovered no cracks in the safety plate.  There were no fatigue crack arrest marks or corrosion in the fracture faces on the drive rod; it fractured as a result of overstress.  A black coating that felt greasy covered the interior side of the outer clamshell door.  There was a rectangular scuffmark in the center of the black area, which had its long axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the airplane.  The black coating appeared pushed into a slight ridge along the outer edge of the scuffmark.  A small piece of rubber was under a rivet in the middle of the scuffmark.  After placing the tire and gear door together to match their positions when the airplane came to rest, the tire did not touch the scuffmark.

            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate compensation for a wind gust during landing, which resulted in a runway excursion. Contributing to the accident was a windsock partially sheltered by trees that provided inaccurate wind information."

The airplane crashed and came to rest inverted. Witnesses reported that the airplane appeared to be operating normally as the pilot performed touch-and-go landings before the accident. Another witness reported the airplane was low as it approached the runway on the final approach. The pilot had about 2 hours of flight time in the newly built tandem wing airplane. A postaccident examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The examination found the throttle in the retarded position and noted that its location required the pilot to reach his left hand across his body to control it while his right hand was on the control stick. According to sun and moon data for the day of the accident, the landing approach would have been in the direction of the setting sun, which likely would have obscured the pilot\u2019s vision as he approached the runway, making it difficult to judge the airplane\u2019s height above the ground and clearance from the approach lights.",

After the airplane took off, the mechanic who performed the last condition inspection and who was near the departure end of the runway noted an unusual sound; he said the sound was abnormal and expected the pilot to return, but he did not. The airplane\u2019s GPS indicated that the flight proceeded south to the southern Long Island coastline then turned to the west, paralleling the coastline while climbing to a maximum altitude of 2,602 feet. The flight continued on the westerly heading along the southern coast of Long Island and descended to 2,383 feet and then turned north; the VHF transceiver was set to the Farmingdale automatic terminal information service. The flight continued on the northerly heading and descended to 1,812 feet, then turned to an easterly heading, followed by a southeasterly heading toward the southern coast of Long Island. The flight then turned back to an easterly heading with a steadily decreasing altitude and a steady groundspeed of about 86 knots. When just west of Moriches Inlet, the GPS altitude was noted to be 60 feet, and the groundspeed was 85 knots.Several witnesses located near the crash site heard a sputtering engine. One witness stated that the airplane was running flawlessly, but he thought it was going to land because it was flying \u201cway too slow.\u201d Another witness who was located about 1,000 to 1,500 feet west of the Moriches Inlet reported seeing a flock of birds take flight followed by the airplane pitching up and then pitching down into the inlet. Postaccident inspection of the airframe, flight controls, engine, and engine systems revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Although minimal damage was noted on the propeller, no evidence of a bird strike was noted on any component of the airplane. The flaps and landing gear were extended, consistent with a precautionary landing.During the postaccident examination, the left side of the engine exhaust, where it enters the muffler, was circumferentially fractured at a weld, and cracks were noted in a weld-repaired area of the left side exhaust system components; the fracture and cracks can be attributed to overload as a result of impact. There was no evidence of exhaust gas escaping the repaired area. Further, no carbon monoxide was detected in specimens of the pilot or passenger taken during the postmortem examinations. Although a crack to the left side exhaust system had been detected 9 days earlier and repaired at a non-aviation facility, it did not play a role in the accident.The fuel selector was found positioned to the tip tanks, both of which were breached during the impact sequence; therefore, no determination could be made as to the quantity of fuel in the tanks at the time of the accident. Although the remaining quantity of fuel in the main fuel tank was not quantified during the postaccident investigation, the airplane had only been operated for 40 minutes since the main fuel tank was filled; the main fuel tank can hold over 2 hours of fuel. No obstructions of the fuel supply from the main or tip tanks were noted, and the engine-driven fuel pump tested satisfactorily. Although about 6 ounces of water was drained from the main fuel tank, the water was consistent with ocean water; no other contaminants from the tank were noted. Water contamination was also noted from a sample of fuel and water drained from an open fuel supply line for the right tip tank; however, the right tip tank was breached and the water was likely from the ocean. No fuel or contamination was noted in the carburetor bowl.Although a valve on the left side of the firewall was inoperative, which allowed heated air to enter the cockpit by the pilot\u2019s side, no determination could be made as to how or if that factored into the accident sequence. Further, that condition had been known by the pilot since September.Based on the flight track and groundspeed recorded by the GPS and the fact that the landing gear and flaps were extended, it is likely that the pilot was performing a precautionary landing. However, the reason for the attempted precautionary landing could not be determined from the available evidence. Based on the witness statement of birds in the area, it is likely that during the precautionary landing, the pilot reacted to the birds by pitching the airplane up, stalled the airplane, and was unable to recover because of the low altitude.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot to maintain airspeed, while attempting a precautionary landing for reasons that could not be determined from the available evidence. Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s pitch-up reaction to birds that took flight during his approach for the precautionary landing, which resulted in an inadvertent stall."

The passenger reported that he had been resting during the flight until the pilot announced that they were approaching the airport. The passenger stated that the airplane was on a 5-mile base leg and that they could see the runway lights when the airplane unexpectedly hit the ground. The passenger reported that he did not hear the pilot make any warning comments. Postaccident examination of the engine and airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.A review of recorded radar data indicated that the airplane had attained a maximum altitude of 4,400 ft as it tracked toward the destination airport, which has an elevation of 1,634 ft. The airplane then began a gradual descent; the last radar target showed the airplane at 2,300 ft near the accident site, which was at an elevation of 2,262 ft and was located high on a ridge in the middle of a wheat field. The debris path was about 486 ft long. Although the pilot could see the runway lights in the distance, it is likely that, due to the lack of illumination, he failed to maintain situational awareness of the hilly terrain that was higher than the airport.The passenger sustained serious injuries. The pilot was conscious after the accident, and he told the passenger that he was trapped in the wreckage and could not get free. The passenger subsequently went for help, and, after 4 hours, he located a house and reported the accident. A search had already been initiated about 2 hours earlier because the airplane had been reported overdue. The wreckage was located shortly after the passenger reported the accident. By the time first responders arrived on site, the pilot had succumbed to his injuries.A review of the pilot\u2019s medical history indicated that he was apparently in good health. Toxicology tests detected the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine in the pilot\u2019s urine, which precluded it from having any ongoing systemic effects on the pilot\u2019s performance. The pilot\u2019s injuries, which included blunt force head and chest trauma, were not immediately fatal, and it is possible he could have survived for hours. The cold weather likely contributed to the development of acidosis due to the severity of the pilot\u2019s injuries and may have further impeded his ability to breathe.The only emergency locator transmitter (ELT) device on board the airplane broadcast an emergency signal on 121.5 and 243.0 MHz. The ELT was functional, but no pilots reported hearing an emergency beacon following the accident. Further, the International Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system has not monitored ELTs operating on 121.5 and 243.0 MHz since February 2009. Therefore, with the ELT that was on board the airplane, the injured pilot could not have been located any faster than the 4-hour response time that occurred after the injured passenger notified local authorities about the accident. The pilot\u2019s injuries led to his death within this time period.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-SARSAT reported that, if a 406-MHz ELT had survived the crash and activated properly, it could have provided a first alert within minutes to the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center and an accurate location within 90 minutes. Further, if the ELT had GPS capabilities, the location of the accident site could also have been identified within minutes. An earlier notification would have significantly reduced the emergency response time and increased the chances of the pilot\u2019s survival.",

The pilot transmitted a \"mayday\" call on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency just before the airplane entered the left turn. During postaccident testing of the engine, excessive vibration occurred as the rpm increased, and one of the spark plugs became excessively sooty, indicating an overly rich fuel/air mixture. The carburetor was then replaced and the engine ran normally at all power test points; the previously sooty spark plug was normal after this test. The accident carburetor was then examined, and a pin that secures the carburetor\u2019s metal floats to their pivot point in the carburetor bowl was missing. Marks indicating contact on the edge of a float and on the side of the bowl were found, indicative of rubbing interference with the side of the bowl. The float-to-bowl contact likely altered the fuel quantity in the bowl, which likely created an overly rich mixture that would have further reduced available engine power at the high density altitude at which the airplane was being operated.

The airplane was owned by Iksgiza Air Service, LLC., Fairbanks, Alaska, and operated by the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council, Fairbanks, as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country flight under the provisions of Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. Of the four persons aboard, the pilot and one passenger sustained minor injuries, and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight had originally departed Fairbanks, and made stops in Anvik and Kaltag, Alaska. The accident flight departed from the Kaltag Airport about 1300, and was en route to the Galena Airport. During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on June 2, the pilot noted that the purpose of the flight was to transport three employees of the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council to Fairbanks so they could attend a training class. He said that after departing from Fairbanks, he flew to Anvik and picked up one passenger, and then he flew to Kaltag and subsequently picked up two additional passengers, then he departed for Galena. He said that the flight between Fairbanks, Anvik, and Kaltag were uneventful. The pilot noted that he planned to purchase fuel at Galena, before continuing on to Fairbanks. As the flight approached the Galena Airport, and while flying level at 1,500 feet msl, the pilot said that the engine began to run rough and lose power, which was immediately followed by a loss of all engine power. The pilot said he was unable to restart the engine, and he selected a marshy area next to a small lake as a forced landing area. During the forced landing, the airplane's wheels contacted an area of soft, tundra-covered terrain, and the airplane nosed over, sustaining damage to the fuselage and wings. The airplane came to rest inverted, and partially submerged in lake water. The airplane was equipped with a Continental Motors O-470 series engine, and an NTSB postaccident inspection is pending following wreckage recovery.

The accident site was described as an open field and suitable for a forced landing.  The landing gear was down, and there were three propeller strike marks in the earth at the point of touchdown.  It was determined that the airplane had at least an 11 to 12 degree nose-up angle at the point of touchdown.

The right intake scoop, that covers the right side of the engine and the right turbocharger, was heat blistered. Disassembly and examination of the engine revealed no anomalies that would have prevented normal operation and production of rated power.  Metallurgical examination of the turbochargers showed \"no evidence of cracks, punctures, or holes that would allow any exhaust gas to escape, and the mechanical damage was determined to be impact related.\"  The right turbocharger, however, exhibited \"a black flame impingement pattern on the outboard side of the wastegate actuator.  The rear face of the actuator mounting bracket displayed a similar impingement pattern and the forward face of the bracket displayed a deposit consistent with flame contact.  The impingement pattern was consistent with a flame directed forward.  To the rear of the actuator are two oil lines, one is an oil pressure line from the engine and the other is connected to the density controller (the density controller is operated by the discharge air pressure from the turbocharger and adjusts the bleed rate of the oil pressure thereby controlling the wastegate actuator).  A portion of the upper oil line was still attached to the actuator and an examination revealed that only the wire braiding remained.  The wire braiding was discolored, consistent with it being overheated.\"  The airplane's co-builder supplied photographs that showed \"there was no other flame source to the rear of the oil line and the actuator.  It is therefore probable that a leak in the oil line sprayed oil forward onto the wastegate actuator and the oil spray was ignited by the hot turbine section of the turbocharger to which the actuator is connected, and initiated the in-flight fire.\"  The pilot's autopsy revealed no soot in the air passageways.

During missed approach, the aircraft flew east of parallel runway 16L and in proximity to an approximately 290-foot-high air traffic control (ATC) tower under construction on the airport.  The crew subsequently made a second approach and landing attempt without further incident.  The flight crew reported that the incident approach was flown with the autopilot coupled to the #1 NAV, and that all instruments indicated on course and on glide slope during final approach. The crew reported that at decision height, they initiated a missed approach when they did not observe the proper visual cues, and that the tower subsequently informed them that they were left of course.  On the second (successful) approach attempt, the first officer hand-flew the approach using the #2 NAV.  Visibility at the time was reported as 1/4 statute mile with freezing fog, with a vertical visibility of 100 feet.  A post-incident flight inspection of the localizer and glide slope did not disclose any problems with the ILS signal.  During post-incident troubleshooting of the aircraft's course deviation circuitry, maintenance personnel discovered a defective relay in the switching matrix for the aircraft's flight management system (FMS), which was installed under an FAA Supplemental Type Certificate.  Whenever the area around the FMS switching matrix or the defective relay itself was physically tapped, the captain's course deviation indicator (CDI) was observed to jump.  When a replacement relay was installed, this anomaly was not observed.  Inflight system testing also disclosed that the autopilot was erratic in pitch, with porpoising about the glide slope.  Maintenance personnel subsequently discovered an anomaly during the autopilot pitch computer self test, which was resolved by replacing the fore and aft pitch accelerometers.  Maintenance personnel further discovered that by replacing the BNC connectors at NAV 1 and NAV 2, significant improvements in system efficiency were attained.  No anomalies with the first officer's CDI indications, or false \"on glide slope\" indications, were found during any post-incident troubleshooting.",

The pilot and 3 passengers received fatal injuries. The aircraft was registered to Independence Aviation LLC, and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from the Sheridan County Airport (SHR), Sheridan, Wyoming about 1030, and was destined for the Billings Logan International Airport (BIL), Billings, Montana.Preliminary radar track data indicated that the airplane departed SHR about 1030 and turned to a westerly heading, flying over the Yellowstone National Park. The airplane then flew south and then east over the park. About 1147, the pilot contacted the Salt Lake Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and requested an instrument flight rules clearance to BIL. At this time the airplane's altitude was about 13,500 feet. The controller issued an IFR clearance direct to BIL at an altitude of 15,000 feet after confirming that the pilot could maintain terrain and obstacle clearance on his own while climbing to 15,000 feet. Shortly after reaching 15,000 feet, the airplane dropped off of radar with no further communication between it and air traffic control.The airplane came to rest in a heavily wooded area about 18 miles west-northwest of Cody, Wyoming. The GPS derived elevation at the accident site was 7,762 feet above mean sea level (msl). The airplane had impacted a creek bed in a near vertical attitude. The entire airplane was fragmented. Portions of both wings, including the wing tips, the tail surfaces, and both engines were located at the accident site. The site was in a densely wooded area with trees estimated to be about 100 feet in height. One tree had its top broken off and another had a scrape with missing bark on its side.

However, witnesses and the pilot of the tow plane stated that shortly after the glider lifted off, it began to fly erratically back and forth on tow with the air brakes somewhat extended. The pilot did not respond to a radio call from the tow plane pilot advising him of the floating air brakes. Witnesses and the tow plane pilot observed the glider positioned low and to the left of the tow plane before it suddenly climbed up and to the right. The tow rope broke and the glider stalled then spun to the ground. No preexisting malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the glider were noted. The floating air brakes were likely due to the pilot's failure to secure the handle before takeoff, but they should not have resulted in a loss of control and could have been easily corrected by the pilot. The pilot had recently successfully completed a flying club check ride, and the wind at the time of the accident was relatively light and should not have been a factor. The pilot's autopsy and toxicological results did not reveal any physiological issues that would have affected the flight.

About 30 minutes before the turbulence was encountered, the company flight dispatcher communicated to the flight crew that the flight was approaching an area of forecast moderate to severe turbulence associated with mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 (39,000 feet).  The dispatcher recommended that the flight alter course and descend to FL280 (28,000 feet).  Eighteen minutes before the turbulence was encountered the pilot requested a \"ride report\" at FL310 from air traffic control and was told to expect \"occasional light chop, nothing real bad.\"  The pilot remained at FL310 and remained on the existing routing.  Approaching the area of forecast turbulence, he illuminated the seat belt sign and advised the passengers of the potential for turbulence.

While inbound to the airport for landing in high winds and moderate rain, the crew decided they could not do a \u201cnormal \u2018weight-off\u2019\u201d to determine the weight and trim because they were heavy with rain, had no ballast to drop, and could only estimate their trim by visually checking the ballonet volume.

While setting up for the approach, the nose dropped. The CFI attributed this to gusty weather conditions that prevailed at the time. He simultaneously noted that the hull pressure indicator (HPI) was low and switched the fan blower to the ON position to add air to the front ballonet. He indicated that the rear ballonet was in the AUTO position. The nose recovered and then dropped again. The CFI again noted that the HPI reading was low. He recovered using the same procedure as before, and the nose dropped a third time. The CFI checked the air pressure system and saw that the rear ballonet valve was open but stated that the indicator light on the annunciator panel indicated that the valve should have been closed. (Subsequent investigation determined that the annunciator light was wired through a valve position sensor switch and that the air valves and annunciator lights functioned properly in the open and closed positions.) Both pilots visually confirmed that a least one of the aft valves was open and would not respond to air valve control inputs. The CFI attempted to manually close the valve, with no response. Observations of the ground crew confirmed that the aft ballonet valves were open. On the first attempt to land, the airship was too high and came in too fast. The CFI aborted the landing then set up for a second approach. Due to the nose-low condition, he added more power and placed the joystick (flight control system) to the full aft position to raise the nose. The CFI stated that he needed full aft on the joystick to keep the nose up, and any movement forward resulted in an immediate drop of the nose. He concluded that the flight controls were malfunctioning, but because of low altitude, high airspeed, deteriorating weather, and the need to get the airship on the ground, he did not have time to accomplish a complete emergency procedure for a flight control malfunction. The airship landed very hard at a fast forward airspeed and with a very heavy nose. The landing gear collapsed and the gondola dug into the ground. The airship then skidded across an adjacent taxiway and struck a parked airplane. Both pilots jumped out on opposite sides of the gondola and pulled the emergency envelope deflation ripcords, but the deflation panels did not open because of the advertising banner that was attached to the airship. The airship took off, unmanned, and reached a peak altitude of 1,600 feet above ground level. The airship traveled about 4 miles northeast and struck a marina where the envelope draped over sailboats and a restaurant. The investigation reviewed the Federal Aviation Administration-approved flight manual. In the emergency procedures section, under \u201cpressure-related emergencies,\u201d the manual stated that, with a high pressure indication, the pilot should check that the helium release valves and air valves are in the UNLOCKED position. The flight manual did not address added weight to the airship caused by environmental conditions (rain). With the aft ballonet valves in the OPEN position and the fan for the forward ballonet in the ON position, the forward ballonet became fully inflated, which caused the out-of-trim/unequal hull pressure condition. A review of the airship design certification indicated that it did not address the aerodynamic effects of advertising banners being draped over the rapid envelope deflation emergency ripcords or the effects of rain on the airship. The emergency ripcord deflation system was never tested on the airship in various environmental conditions, only on a mock-up in a hangar. Because of structural damage sustained in the impact sequence, the airship\u2019s systems could not be tested as installed on the airship. However, each individual system was functionally tested, and no anomalies were found. There was no minimum equipment list for the airship. If a component was inoperative, the airship was considered to be in an unairworthy condition. The dual ballonet level cockpit indicator had been taped over and marked \u201cIn-Op\u201d before the flight.",
            "probable_cause": "One or both of the rear ballonet air relief valves remained in an open position for undetermined reasons, which caused an out-of-balance trim condition; also causal was the flight crew\u2019s decision to the fly the airship with a known deficiency (the inoperative ballonet indicator) and the pilot\u2019s failure to follow proper emergency procedures."

As the flight approached the destination airport, visibility decreased below the 2 mile minimum required for the initiation of the approach.  The pilot entered a holding pattern, and waited for the weather to improve.  After holding for about 45 minutes, the ceiling and visibility had improved, and the flight was cleared for the ILS 25 instrument approach.  After the pilot's initial contact with ATCT personnel, no further radio communications were received.  When the flight did not reach the destination airport, it was reported overdue.  A search in the area of an ELT signal located the accident airplane on a hilly, tree-covered island.

The flight attendants and passengers complained of pain in their ears at that time. The flight crew placed the pressurization system into manual control, turned off the autopilot and autothrottle systems, and began a descent to return to Miami. During the return to Miami, several lavatory smoke alarms activated and the captain call light illuminated in the cabin; however, no evidence of fire or smoke was found.  The flight crew did not complete the checklists for manual pressurization control and emergency landing during the return to Miami, both of which called for the airplane to be depressurized prior to landing.   After landing and stopping on a taxiway, the captain also noticed an aft baggage compartment fire loop light illuminated, prompting him to evacuate the airplane.  After the captain ordered the evacuation, the flight attendants attempted to open the doors.  The doors would not open.  The flight attendant/purser at the L1 (front left passenger) door continued to attempt to open the door, and the door explosively opened, ejecting the flight attendant/purser from the airplane to the ground, causing fatal injuries. The remainder of the doors opened and the airplane was evacuated. The emergency evacuation checklist did not call for the flight crew to check for depressurization of the airplane prior to commanding an evacuation.

There were no FAA technical standards for the lavatory smoke detectors. A sensor in the aft cargo compartment was found out of tolerance and also activated when subjected to abnormal pressure.   The cabin doors were found to have no means for relieving pressure prior to opening the doors.   The cabin altimeter in the cockpit did not have a mechanical stop in the negative direction, and under excessive pressure conditions, allowed the needle to move past the negative range into the high positive range.   The aircraft manufacturer stated that when the pressurization system is in the manual mode, the outflow valves do not automatically open during landing and that a person cannot open a door if the airplane is pressurized above approximately 1.5 psi differential.    As result of this investigation, the Safety Board previously issued 18 safety recommendations to the FAA. ",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the flight crew to perform the cabin pressurization manual control abnormal checklist after experiencing a pressurization system malfunction and switching to manual pressurization control, and the failure of the flight crew to perform the emergency landing checklist prior to landing, resulting in the airplane having an excessive cabin pressure level after landing which led to a rapid decompression of the airplane when a flight attendant opened door and was ejected out of the airplane during emergency evacuation that was initiated by the captain.   Contributing to the accident was the failure of operator maintenance personnel to ensure that insulation blankets around the forward and aft outflow valves were properly secured in accordance with airplane manufacturer's data, resulting in a malfunction of the pressurization system.   Other contributing factors include the absence of FAA requirements that each emergency exit door has a system to relieve pressure or contain specific warnings (such as lights, placards, or other indications that clearly identify the danger of opening the emergency exit doors when the airplane is over pressurized); the absence of FAA technical specifications for lavatory ionization smoke detectors; the absence of a requirement in the airplane's ground/emergency evacuation checklist for the flight crew to ensure that the cabin differential pressure is zero pounds per square inch before signaling flight attendants to begin an emergency evacuation; and the absence of a mechanical stop in the negative direction on the cabin altimeter gauge."

Please see the public docket for this accident to view the original report.** The commercial pilot was on a Part 135 passenger flight transporting telecommunication technicians to remote sites. A technician was left at one site, and when the helicopter did not return, he contacted his employer. His employer contacted the helicopter operator. Unable to make contact with the helicopter, the operator contacted the FAA, and reported the helicopter overdue. A search for the helicopter was initiated based on a position report from the helicopter's onboard commercial satellite tracking system. A snowstorm in the search area precluded the use of aircraft in the search, and ground searchers were unsuccessful. A State Trooper helicopter found the crash site the next morning when the weather improved. The pilot and three passengers were found dead; the fourth passenger, the minor stepson of one of the technicians, had head injuries and hypothermia. According to the operator and survivor, after transporting the first technician, the helicopter landed at a rest area near the highway and picked up another technician and his stepson prior to going to the next site. The stepson was in the left front seat, and the three technicians were in the rear seats. The destination site was about 2.5 miles from the rest area across a ravine. A motorist on the highway saw the helicopter depart from the rest area, and then make a steep descent into a ravine. He said he thought the descent was unusual, but he did not see any impact, and thought the helicopter was working in the ravine. He said the visibility was about 2 miles, and it was snowing lightly. The helicopter impacted terrain approximately in a level attitude in a near vertical descent, about three-quarters of a mile from the rest area. The terrain at the accident site was rough and uneven, covered with trees, high brush, and snow. The accident flight lasted less than 2 minutes. The surviving front seat passenger recalled the liftoff and departure, then said he felt like he was falling, and that the pilot told everyone to \"hold on we're going to crash.\" The main rotor blades remained attached to the rotor head; two of the blades were resting on the ground, and the third blade was suspended over the ravine. The uncut brush surrounding the two blades resting on the ground and the downward chordwise bend of the suspended blade were consistent with low rotor rpm at final impact.Examination of the helicopter's engine and drive train revealed damage signatures indicative of an overtorque event. These signatures included a 7 millimeter misalignment of the engine's module 5 drive nut and torsional damage (twisting) of the engine-to-transmission driveshaft, which shortened the driveshaft, allowing the splines at the aft end of the shaft to disengage, disconnecting the engine from the main transmission. The module 5 drive nut misalignment was consistent with the engine free turbine producing power at the time of the drive nut overtorque. The direction of rotational smearing damage observed on a portion of the splines was indicative of the engine continuing to provide power for a short time after the driveshaft twisted and shortened. The directionality of the driveshaft twisting was consistent with an opposing torque load forward (on the transmission side) of the driveshaft, which could have resulted from a main transmission seizure or a main rotor impact event. Disassembly and examination of the main transmission revealed no evidence of a seizure. Therefore, the overtorque likely resulted from one or more main rotor blade strikes occurring while the engine was powering the main rotor system. Further, the overtorque damage likely occurred before the helicopter's final impact in the ravine because the low rotor rpm signatures observed at the accident site indicated that the engine was not powering the main rotor system and that the rotational energy in the system had been significantly dissipated before that impact.The helicopter's main rotor blades did not exhibit the extensive damage typically seen when powered blades impact terrain (such as fragmentation, twisting, and severe leading-edge damage). However, the outboard sections of the blades did exhibit leading-edge dents and chordwise scratches. Thus, the blades likely impacted relatively soft objects, such as a snow bank or brush, which resulted in the overtorque signatures found on the module 5 drive nut and the engine-to-transmission driveshaft without significant destructive damage to the blades. About 2 months after the accident, investigators searched along the route of flight and found no evidence of a main rotor blade strike (such as ground scars or damaged vegetation); any evidence of impact likely had been obscured by that time.The engine also showed evidence of an overspeed. Following the overtorque, the sudden disconnection of the main transmission from the engine unloaded the engine and allowed the free turbine to overspeed to more than 150% free turbine rpm, resulting in free turbine blade shedding and loss of engine power. When the main transmission disconnected from the engine, the main rotor rpm immediately began to decay, leaving the pilot no option other than to initiate an autorotation. The low rotor rpm signatures observed at the accident site indicated that the pilot likely autorotated but could not sufficiently arrest the helicopter's vertical descent rate, resulting in a hard impact with terrain. Given the rough and uneven terrain and the helicopter's low altitude, a successful autorotation landing was improbable. Also, the operator's failure to closely monitor the flight's progress and to make timely inquiries into its whereabouts delayed the search and rescue of the survivor and likely added to the severity of his injuries (hypothermia).The floor-mounted fuel flow control lever (FFCL) was found captured by fuselage crush in the forward emergency range, and the emergency fuel shutoff lever was captured in the aft shutoff position. During impact, the removable acrylic left chin-bubble popped out, and was found about 3 feet in front of the helicopter's nose. A backpack belonging to the surviving passenger was found between the chin bubble and the nose of the helicopter. All other baggage/cargo was found stowed aft and secured. According to the manufacturer, inadvertent movement of the floor-mounted FFCL into the forward emergency range can cause the engine to overspeed within seconds in certain conditions. Because the FFCL is on the helicopter's cabin floor, situated near the front seat passenger's right foot, and is easily moved with minimal pressure, a scenario involving the passenger's foot or his backpack inadvertently moving the FFCL into the emergency range during the flight and causing the engine to overspeed was considered. However, there was no heat damage to the engine's compressor turbine wheels as would be expected due to the excessive influx of fuel into the engine that would immediately result from movement of the FFCL into the emergency range during flight. Further, this scenario does not account for the overtorque damage to the engine's module 5 nut and the engine-to-transmission driveshaft, which had to occur when the engine was producing power (before shedding of the free turbine blades). Therefore, it is not likely that inadvertent movement of the FFCL caused the engine overspeed. Although the reason for the FFCL being in the emergency range could not be determined, it is possible that because it can be easily moved, it was displaced into the emergency range during the impact sequence.",
            "probable_cause": "An in-flight overtorque of the engine-to-transmission driveshaft resulting in disconnection of the main transmission from the engine. The overtorque likely occurred due to an in-flight main rotor blade contact with snow-covered terrain, precluding significant main rotor blade damage and ground scarring. Contributing to the severity of the surviving occupant's injuries was the helicopter operator's failure to properly monitor their satellite flight-following system and to immediately institute a search once the system reported that the helicopter was overdue."

As the airplane flew above the runway it drifted to the left. After the airplane touched down, the student heard and felt the left main landing gear impact something. Recorded winds at the accident airport were variable at 7 knots. Postaccident examination revealed that the airplane had struck a runway light with its left main landing gear. The airplane's fuselage structure had come into contact with a bell crank during the accident, and a rod end that attached to the bell crank broke. This rendered the pitch control system inoperative. The student pilot stated that he should have \"gone around,\" but he was a \"little confused about the airspeed at the time.\" As a result of this statement, NTSB investigators examined photographic evidence of the airplane's cockpit, and the airspeed information that was published in the airplane manufacturer's Pilot Operating Handbook (POH). The examinations revealed that the airspeed indicator's indicator and airspeed color code range markings did not agree with the information published in the supplied airplane manufacturer's POH and also that the markings were inaccurate. This could lead to confusion as well as an accident, as the indicated airspeed is an important value for the pilot as it directly indicates stall speed and various airframe structurally limited speeds, regardless of density altitude.  Furthermore, it was discovered that the stall speed information and airspeed indicator calibration information published in the POH in many cases was inaccurate and contained large differences (in several instances almost 20 knots) between the published indicated airspeeds and the published calibrated airspeeds.",

Three prior incidents involving similar failures of this part number turbocharger had occurred in May 2007. Examination of the failed turbochargers from all four incidents revealed that all of the units displayed the same discrepancy: the compressor wheel backface perpendicularity to the bore exceeded the maximum permissible value. The source of the perpendicularity error was traced to a change, made in March 2007, to the machining process for the compressor wheel. The change involved a switch from a two-machine process to a three-machine process. This production change was made without formal documentation or coordination with other functional areas; no formal first-article inspection for the new process was performed. In April 2007, the machine shop returned to the original two-machine process.

They left to go to another party and while en route, the vehicle was pulled over by a police officer. During the diversion, the group agreed to instead go to a nearby city to gamble. The flight subsequently departed around 0120 with the airplane about 160 lbs. over its maximum gross weight. An airport video recording that captured the takeoff revealed that the airplane remained either on the ground or in ground effect for over two-thirds of the length of the runway, consistent with the pilot attempting to gain airspeed in the overweight airplane. The airplane then aggressively pitched nose up and climbed out of view of the camera. Seconds later, the airplane reappeared in a near-vertical descent into the dirt area at the end of the runway, most likely due to an aerodynamic stall during the steep climb. A review of the pilot's toxicological tests found that the post-mortem blood ethanol level was 0.105 percent, which is more than twice the Federal Aviation Administration limit for civil aviators (0.04 percent). The evidence points to ingestion as the primary source of the ethanol in the pilot and implies that his pre-mortem ethanol level was high enough to significantly impair his judgment and psychomotor skills. It is likely that the pilot's consumption of alcohol preflight contributed to this accident. Postaccident examinations of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.",

Two seat belts became unhooked at seats 21B and 22F, resulting in those passengers contacting the overhead baggage compartments. An infant, who was being held by his mother, hit the overhead area as well.  Two additional passengers and a flight attendant were injured by rough contact with the airplane structure during the turbulence encounter.  The flight continued and landed without further incident.  The flight data recorder disclosed that the airplane experienced a vertical acceleration over a 2-second period between -0.76 and +1.762 G's.  Following the incident, the failed restraints were examined.  Investigators noted that the keeper in the D-ring attachments for the belts for seats 21B and 22F were bent about 15 degrees from the center of the steel hook, which would allow the D-rings to unhook from the D-ring attached to the seat frame.  NTSB Safety Recommendation A-99-11 recommended that the FAA reexamine the design of seat belts installed on passenger seats on air carrier, air taxi, and commercial airplanes to determine the reason some had become unhooked from their seat attachments during turbulence or a hard landing and establish a suitable means of ensuring that the seat belts remain attached to their shackles during all modes of flight. In 1999 the FAA formed an industry Seat Committee that determined the seatbelts that became unhooked during hard landing or turbulence were only on seats equipped with D-ring seat attachments.  Because the Seat Committee reported that the seats with D-rings ceased being manufactured in 1992,  the FAA issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) NM-04-37, to advise the  operators of transport category airplanes to expedite the replacement of D-ring-type seat anchors with an improved design fitting.  The incident operator reported that seat 21B was manufactured in November 1996, and seat 22F was manufactured in August 1992.

Both airline transport pilots were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight, which was destined for Opa-Locka Executive Airport (OPF), Miami, Florida. The positioning flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to ground service personnel at OPF, they observed the accident airplane as it prepared to taxi and noticed that its baggage door was open. Two of the ground handlers subsequently boarded their ATV and drove out to the airplane, parking about 10 feet in front of the left wing. One of the ground handlers then dismounted the ATV and proceeded in front of the airplane while motioning to the crew in the cockpit that the baggage door was open. The pilot seated in the right seat then stood up and proceeded into the cabin.  Shortly after, the airplane began moving forward.  The ground handler then unsuccessfully attempted to gain the attention of the pilot seated in the left seat, as it moved toward and struck the ATV, resulting in substantial damage to the airplane's left wing. About one week after the accident, the operator's director of maintenance completed a preflight inspection and check of the airplane's hydraulic and braking systems under the supervision of a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, with no anomalies noted.

The airplane was owned and being operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules personal cross-country flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and the solo pilot received fatal injuries. The airplane was departing Banks Lake for Lake Washington, near Seattle, Washington.A witness told the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) that the airplane had arrived at Banks Lake on Thursday, May 22. After landing on the lake, the pilot had lowered the land wheels with the intent to taxi the airplane on to a beach. Approaching the beach the left main landing gear struck a submerged berm damaging the landing gear and its supporting structure. The pilot who was authorized to work on the airplane spent the next several days making repairs to the airplane. Another witness told the NTSB IIC that he was on the lake fishing from his boat, when he heard and saw the airplane attempt to takeoff. He said the airplane started a high speed run but then the engine throttled back and the airplane turned toward the beach as if returning to the beach. Then the airplane abruptly turned 180 degrees and started another high speed run. He said the water was choppy with the addition of numerous boat wakes. He said he thought the airplane was going 40-50 miles per hour when it encountered boat wake. The airplane may have bounced 4-5 feet in the air and then abruptly nosed down into the lake. The airplane came to an abrupt stop with a 20-30 foot high splash. He headed his boat toward the airplane. When he arrived the airplane's high wings were level with the surface of the water, and the pylon mounted engine was still running. Another boat had arrived prior to his and swimmers were in the water attempting to recover the pilot. After recovery, the pilot was taken to a boat ramp where an ambulance was waiting. Shortly thereafter the airplane sank in about 50 feet of water. The only part of the airplane recovered was an approximately 6 foot long section of the cabin hull bottom, from the aft hull-step forward.Further examination of the airplane is pending, subsequent to its recovery from the lake.",
