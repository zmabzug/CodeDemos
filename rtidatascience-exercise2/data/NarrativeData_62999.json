During the first phone call, the pilot advised the briefing specialist that he was airport hopping.  He was advised during the second phone call of widely scattered thunderstorms embedded in rain that existed along his route of flight, and that after 2400Z, the forecast was for the ceilings to improve to 3,500 feet, with occasional IFR conditions with thunderstorms and rain showers for another 1.5 hours.  There were no known witnesses who saw the flight depart, and at approximately 1752, the pilot established communications with Jacksonville ARTCC (JAX ARTCC).  While in communication with that facility, the pilot advised that he was in between layers and heard communications from a pilot who had executed a missed approach to his destination airport reporting that he encountered heavy rain.  The flight continued and air traffic communications were transferred to the Panama City Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT).  The pilot established communications with that facility and advised that the flight was 6 miles northwest of the airport.  Radar data indicates that while in contact with that facility and flying over water on a reported dark night, the pilot was advised by the Panama City  ATCT controller that the weather conditions were below VFR minimums and what were his intentions.  The radar data indicated that the pilot descended an additional 400 feet after being advised of the weather conditions and began a slight left turn.  The pilot advised the controller that the flight would proceed northbound; the airplane was lost from radar at 1813:07.  The wreckage was located approximately 062 degrees and .4 nautical mile from the last radar target.  The wreckage was located in water and recovered for further examination which revealed no evidence of an in-flight breakup and no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction of the flight controls.  Examination of the engine and engine systems revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the vacuum pump, and several gyroscopic instruments revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  No determination was made as to the pilot's instrument currency.",

A witness who was boating on the lake across from the helicopter landing area watched the helicopter approach and land. He stated that the landing light was on during the landing. He watched the passengers exit the helicopter and then the helicopter lift off and turn toward the lake, descend down an embankment, and turn over the lake. The witness stated that the landing light was not on during the departure. The helicopter traveled about 150 yards when the bottom skids began to make the water spray. The helicopter then nosed over and impacted the water. The witness then directed his boat toward the impact area where he found the tail boom separated from the fuselage and the cockpit area submerged. Examination of the fuselage, including the top Plexiglas window and frame, revealed evidence of main rotor contact. The helicopter\u2019s engine was torn from the fuselage and could not be located due to poor visibility in the water and its irregular bottom features. The engine control unit (ECU) was retrieved, and all of the data revealed that no engine operating exceedances occurred before impact, and no accumulated engine faults were recorded during the previous engine run. The ECU data and physical evidence are consistent with power being supplied to the main rotor at the moment of impact.Security camera video footage revealed that the pilot had successfully conducted this low-level, rapid acceleration takeoff profile several times during the day when visual spatial references were plentiful. The available data and evidence, as well as the previous flights, are consistent with controlled flight into water while conducting a rapidly accelerating, low-altitude flight after takeoff over an unlit body of water in dark night conditions. The pilot\u2019s decision to attempt a such a takeoff at night without the aid of ambient light or the use of helicopter lights denied him the visual spatial references needed to assure safe terrain and obstacle avoidance. Additionally, the conditions during the flight were conducive to a type of pilot spatial disorientation known as \u201csomatogravic illusion,\u201d in which aircraft acceleration may be misinterpreted by the pilot as an increasing nose-up pitch attitude and result in inappropriate nose-down control inputs.

Another witness working in his yard just north of the racetrack said he heard the sound of a small airplane, stopped what he was doing and searched to gain sight of the airplane.  He said that he had a clear view of the airplane.  It was traveling north-northwest at an altitude of 150 to 200 feet and descending slightly.  The witness said the engine speed was very high, but sounded normal, and the flaps were up.  The witness watched the airplane until he lost sight of it behind some trees.  \"About the time I lost visual contact \u2026 I heard the metallic sound and noticed that all the power wires (east and west) were bouncing.\"  The witness said he ran into the house to call 9-1-1, but the phones were dead and there was no power to the house.

(This smoke would not have been visible to the pilot.) The pilot reported that, about 10 minutes after departure, he noticed the illumination of the low engine oil pressure warning light. He noted that the oil pressure gauge was also showing low pressure but that there was no rise in the oil temperature or the exhaust gas temperature. Because the pilot had recently experienced an intermittent oil pressure gauge problem in another helicopter, he assumed the accident helicopter was experiencing a similar problem and continued toward the intended destination while attempting to verify the loss of engine oil pressure. Several minutes later, the pilot noticed a low-torque indication but no rise in the oil temperature or exhaust gas temperature. About 25 minutes after departure, the pilot saw a rise in the exhaust gas temperature and lowered the collective to reduce power. After briefly decreasing, the exhaust gas temperature began rising again, and the pilot located an open field to perform an off-airport landing. The engine experienced a total loss of power before the helicopter reached the open field; the pilot performed an autorotation, and the helicopter landed hard. \u000bPostaccident examination revealed that the engine oil tank was empty and that the engine had sustained heat damage consistent with overtemperature due to oil exhaustion. An obstruction of solidified oil carbon was found in the rear bearing chip detector housing union, which would have restricted the oil scavenge of the rear bearing. According to the engine manufacturer, failure to scavenge the oil  in the rear bearing would cause overpressurization of the rear bearing housing area, which would force engine oil out of the rear bearing vent line. In addition, oil overpressurization could overcome the labyrinth seal of the piston shaft, which would allow oil to flow into the gas exhaust path. It is likely that this occurred because oil flowing into the exhaust path would result in black smoke coming from the engine exhaust as was observed by the witness. The continued operation of the engine in this condition likely resulted in the depletion of the oil reservoir, the illumination of the low engine oil pressure warning light, and, subsequently, as the flight continued, a total loss of engine power. A review of data recovered from a flight recorder installed in the helicopter indicated that, about 2 minutes after departure (about 26 minutes before the accident), the oil pressure dropped from about 4 bars to about 0.2 bar, which would have illuminated the low engine oil pressure warning light. The flight manual and the cockpit emergency checklist both directed that, when the low engine oil pressure warning light was illuminated and the engine oil pressure gauge indicated low oil pressure (as reported by the pilot), the procedure was to land immediately. If the pilot had followed this procedure instead of continuing the flight with the warning light illuminated, it is likely that the accident would have been prevented. \u000b\u000bReview of the helicopter\u2019s maintenance records indicated that, about 12 flight hours before the accident flight, the engine\u2019s 2nd-stage turbine disk (T2) was replaced. During the replacement of the T2, the maintenance technician determined that the rear bearing was \u201cclean\u201d; therefore, he did not clean the rear bearing even though the maintenance procedures required a systematic cleaning when the T2 was replaced regardless of the condition of the bearing. If the cleaning had been performed, as called for in the maintenance procedures, it is likely that the oil carbon deposit in the rear bearing chip detector housing union would have been discovered and removed, thus averting the accident.\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s improper decision to continue flight with a low engine oil pressure warning light instead of landing immediately in accordance with the flight manual emergency checklist. Contributing to the accident was the maintenance technician\u2019s failure to clean the rear bearing in accordance with the engine manufacturer\u2019s guidance when replacing the 2nd-stage turbine wheel, which resulted in an obstruction of solidified oil carbon in the rear bearing chip detector housing union, subsequent oil exhaustion, and engine failure.

The crankshaft failed as the result of fatigue cracking initiated by surface damage and localized overheating.  The crankshaft was reportedly overhauled 165 hours prior to the failure.  Optical examinations of the fracture faces found beach marks and crack arrest lines indicative of fatigue cracking though the majority of the crank cheek.  Further examinations established that the fatigue initiated at two origins on the aft radius surface of the No. 3 main bearing journal about halfway between the journal and cheek surfaces.  An oil stain covered the aft radius and cleaning revealed wide spread surface damage to the radius.  The presence of an oil stain on top of the damage indicates that the damage occurred either during the overhaul or soon there after and was not a result of the failure.  The damage extended from the journal surface up to the level of the origin area and completely around the journal.  The surface damage consisted of circumferential scoring, intermittent tearing, and material flow.  The radius also had a slight bronze hue.  Further cleaning and inspections found similar damage and coloration on the forward radius of the No. 3 main bearing but no damage to other journal radii.  The direct visual examination of the No. 3 main bearing journal surface showed heavy circumferential scoring and roughening but no visual indications of overheating.  The majority of the other journals, both rod and main, also displayed similar scoring but to lesser degrees.  Measurements established that the diameters of all main bearing journals were between 2.238 and 2.240 inches.  All rod journals measured 1.927 inches in diameter.  Conversations with a distributor for new Franklin engines indicated that standard bearing sizes for 6A-335 engines are 2.250 to 2.249 inches for mains and 1.9375 to 1.9365 inches for rods.  Bearings for 0.010- and 0.020-inch undersize journals are available for both the main and rod journals.  The measurements on the fractured crankshaft are consistent with 0.010 inch under size journals for both the mains and rods.  The presence of a white layer along with the undersized journals does indicate that the crankshaft had been renitrided at some point in time.  The Franklin 6V-335 was originally certificated in 1956.  The type certificate is now held by iyPZL-Rzeszowl\u008f\u00c8 (PZL) of Poland.",

The airplane bounced but \"not hard enough to have a wheel fall off.\"  The pilot said he was going straight down the runway into \"a few knots of wind.\"  When the airplane touched down again, \"the stub of the right main gear dug into the runway\" and caused the airplane to veer to the right and off the runway.  The right wing struck the ground and the airplane nosed over.  The flight instructor's version of events was somewhat different.  He said the pilot's performance in the traffic pattern was \"somewhat ragged and less precise and exhibited tension.\"  He overshot his downwind-to-base turn by 20 degrees.  The instructor took control of the airplane to reestablish a stable approach, and then returned control to the pilot.  Threshold crossing airspeed was 55 knots.  The pilot allowed the right wing to settle giving a right turn.  The instructor tried to recover but it was too late.  The airplane \"landed hard with the right wing low resulting [in] major ballooning.  When the bottom fell out, the plane landed extremely hard on the right main gear [and] proceeded off the runway\" at a 20 to 30 degree angle and nosed over in the grass.  The airport manager, who witnessed the accident, said the airplane was not aligned with the runway centerline when it landed hard.  The impact tore off the right main landing gear.  The airplane veered off the runway and nosed over.  The right wheel was found on the left side of the runway, and the airplane came to a halt about 300 feet off the right side of the runway.  Laboratory examination revealed  \"the fracture was overstress, consistent with bending from a hard landing impact.  There was a compression buckle at the top and a tensile fracture at the bottom.  There was also considerable plastic deformation, but no indication of pre-existing cracks or defects.\"  Steel type, wall thickness, yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness measurements met or exceeded.  \"The fracture . . . [was the] result of impact on landing.\"  According to the airplane manufacturer, the gear assembly was designed in accordance with ASTM 2245, and successfully passed a drop test of 550 mm (21.7 inches) at a weight of 600 kg (1,323 pounds).",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to correct the alignment of the airplane and his improper recovery from a bounced landing, resulting in exceeding the design stress limits that caused the right main landing gear to fail.  A contributing factor in this accident was the instructor's inadequate supervision of the pilot."

The airplanes were part of a five-aircraft air race demonstration event.  The demonstration air race was completed and the five aircraft were in the process of landing separately (not in formation).  The pilot of Stang reported that he thought the pilot of Precious Metal was departing the pattern and not landing at OSH.  He reported that Stang was about two miles past the runway threshold on downwind at 700 - 800 feet agl, when he observed Precious Metal on a base leg about 1,000 feet agl on a southwesterly heading with its gear and flaps retracted.  Stang turned inbound for landing on runway 36.  Precious Metal turned inbound for landing behind Stang and transmitted \"Precious Metal, one mile final,\" but Stang did not hear the transmission.  The airplanes collided as Stang started its landing roll.  Interviews with the air race demonstration pilots revealed there was confusion concerning the information discussed in the team brief prior to the race.  The team representative reported that he briefed that Stang should land first, but two of the race pilots reported that they did not hear that discussed in the brief.  Also, the team representative briefed that Precious Metal intended to land, refuel, take on a passenger, and then depart OSH for another nearby airport.  The FAA had \"waivered\" the airspace, which made the air show Air Boss responsible for the air show operations, but he was not responsible for providing aircraft separation.  The Air Boss did not observe the two P-51's on short final, because his attention was on an airplane taxiing near the air show center.  The air traffic control tower was not in operation during the air show because the airspace was waivered, and the Air Boss was responsible for air/ground radio communications with the airplanes.  No warning was given to the pilots concerning the lack of separation between the airplanes.  Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 91.113 (g) Right-of-Way Rules state: \"When two or more aircraft are approaching an airport for the purpose of landing, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way, but it shall not take advantage of this rule to cut in front of another which is on final approach to land or to overtake that aircraft.\" ",
            "probable_cause": "The P-51A pilot's inadequate visual lookout and his failure to maintain clearance from the P-51D.  Contributing factors to the accident included the restricted forward visibility of the P-51A, the air race team representative's inadequate flight brief, the failure of the air boss to recognize the lack of separation between the airplanes on short final, and the diminished air/ground radio communications during the air show."

When he realized that the electrically powered landing gear would not extend, he decided to land the airplane in a pasture next to a road. After touchdown, the airplane slid about 70 feet before coming to a stop. The pilot opened the canopy, turned off the fuel and all other switches, and exited the airplane. An examination of the airplane's electrical system showed that neither of the airplane's 12-volt batteries would hold a charge. The examination also showed that both the main and auxiliary fuel pumps were wired to the battery-powered bus. According to the engine manufacturer's service representative, if a battery power failure occurs, the engine would quit running if both fuel pumps were connected to the battery bus instead of one being connected to the internal engine generator.

About 33 seconds later, the helicopter was picked up on radar in a climbing right turn, then a left turn before radar contact was lost at an altitude of 1,500 feet MSL (1,060 AGL).  Witnesses in the area reported observing the helicopter make \"some radical flight maneuvers\" before it lost altitude.  The witnesses reported that the helicopter then descended in a \"nose down\" or \"wobbling\" attitude while it spun to the ground.  Prior to ground impact, several witnesses observed an object or objects separating from the helicopter before they lost site of it in the trees.  Two of the witnesses reported seeing the tail rotors separate followed by the tail section.  The helicopter then collided with trees.  During the on-site and post-accident investigation, it was determined that the tail rotor blades made contact with the side of the tail boom.  The empennage assembly was found about 180 feet away from the main wreckage.  Both tail rotor blades separated from the tail rotor hub.  Components that separated were due to overload.  Although a pitch change link and teeter bumper stop were not recovered, metallurgical examination of the tail rotor pitch control assembly determined that they were attached at impact. There was no evidence that pitch change control was lost prior to the tail rotor blade striking the tail boom. No evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction was found.  Further investigation determined that abrupt application of full left pedal during a simulated power failure could result in excessive flapping of the tail rotor and possible tail rotor blade contact with the tail boom.  At the time of the accident, the mean tail rotor blade angle was 21.5 degrees to 22.0 degrees.  Approximately three months after the accident, the manufacturer issued a service bulletin to re-rig the tail rotor to reduce maximum blade angle at the left pedal stop and required the installation of a harder teeter bumper.

The pilot was a company employee, and the other crewmember, who was not functioning as a pilot, was an employee of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Although the pilot was required by the company to remain present for the duration of the airplane fueling before the flight, he did not do so. A design peculiarity of the fuel quantity system prevented in-cockpit determination of the actual fuel quantity once the fuel level rose above a value that was 21 gallons below the actual maximum capacity. Only a visual inspection of the tank would enable determination of the actual fuel quantity above that level or whether the tank was completely full. The pilot reported that he began the flight with full fuel, but there was no evidence that he visually checked the fuel level. Therefore, it is possible that the flight began with as much as 21 gallons less than the pilot believed. After takeoff, the pilot radioed to his dispatch center that he had 4 hours 30 minutes of fuel on board. Company rules and the exclusive-use contract with the BLM required the pilot to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations that precluded departure without a 30-minute fuel reserve.The fire was located about 15 minutes (still air) flight time from the base airport, but the return flight would be subject to a headwind of about 10 knots. Exclusive of the 30-minute fuel reserve requirement for the beginning of the flight, there were no mission-specific or other factors that dictated the pilot's turnback time. About 4 hours 15 minutes after departure, with the airplane fuel quantity gauge indicating 0 gallons of fuel, the pilot turned back to base. Shortly thereafter, both engines lost power due to fuel exhaustion, and the pilot conducted a forced off-airport landing.The company's and BLM's guidance differed in several aspects regarding the flight planning, briefing, and communication requirements. Due in part to those differences, the two crewmembers did not conduct any preflight briefing, or any in-flight communications, regarding fuel status. Neither of the two was required to, and they did not, establish a minimum fuel value which, when reached, would require them to depart the operating area and return to base. The fuel quantity system had been calibrated about 14 months before the accident, and postaccident examination of the airplane did not reveal any mechanical problems that would have resulted in premature fuel exhaustion. The pilot reported that he relied on his time and fuel consumption calculations instead of the cockpit fuel quantity gauge to determine the fuel remaining and his turnback time. His calculations were based on starting the flight with full fuel tanks, and a nominal flight-planning fuel consumption rate, neither of which could be verified after the accident. Postaccident calculated fuel consumption rates for the flight were in the same range as both recent historical data from the accident airplane and the manufacturer's published values. Although the pilot could have used the fuel gauge in addition to his calculations to determine the remaining fuel, he chose not to. The more conservative risk management approach would have been to turn back to base when the fuel gauge reached the minimum value necessary to complete the flight safely. In addition, neither of the crewmembers explicitly determined and communicated a minimum fuel quantity value that mandated a return to base, and none of their guidance explicitly recommended or required them to do so.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's failure to comply with required fueling procedures and the pilot's poor decision-making in not monitoring his fuel gauge and turning back when it reached minimum fuel."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The single-engine helicopter was operating near its maximum gross weight and was on a repositioning flight back to its home base. About 6 minutes into the flight, cruising at 800 feet above ground level (agl), the helicopter experienced a complete loss of engine power. Witnesses observed the helicopter, which had been flying steadily in a southeast direction, suddenly descend rapidly into a densely populated residential area. Descent rates calculated from the last 10 seconds of radar data were consistent with an autorotation. The witnesses reported that, as the helicopter neared the ground, its descent became increasingly vertical. Examination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter was in a level attitude with little forward speed when it impacted a 5-foot-high concrete wall, which penetrated the fuselage and ruptured the fuel tank. A postimpact fire consumed the cabin and main fuselage of the helicopter.An open roadway intersection was located about 300 feet beyond the accident site, in line with the helicopter\u2019s flight path. It is likely that the pilot was attempting to make an autorotative approach to the open area; however, he was unable to reach it because he had to maneuver the helicopter over a row of 40-foot-tall power lines that crossed the helicopter\u2019s flight path near the accident site. This maneuver depleted the rotor rpm, which, as reported by the witnesses, caused the helicopter\u2019s descent to become near vertical before it impacted the concrete wall, which was across the street from the power lines. The pilot had no training flights during the 317 days since his most recent 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 check flight. The lack of recent autorotation training/practice, although not required, may have negatively impacted the pilot\u2019s ability to maintain proficiency in engine failure emergency procedures and autorotations. However, because the engine failed suddenly at low altitude over a congested area, more recent training may not have changed the outcome.External examination of the engine at the accident site revealed that the fuel inlet union that connected to the fuel injection manifold and provided fuel from the hyrdomechanical unit to the combustion section had become detached from the boss on the compressor case. The two attachment bolts and associated nuts were not present on the union flange nor were they located within the helicopter wreckage debris. Separation of the fuel inlet union from the fuel injection manifold interrupted the supply of fuel to the engine and resulted in a loss of engine power. Postaccident engine runs performed with an exemplar engine showed that, with loose attachment bolts and nuts, the union initially remained installed and fuel would not immediately leak. As the engine continued to operate, the loose nuts would progressively unscrew themselves from the bolts. With the bolts removed, the union would ultimately eject from the boss, and the engine would lose power due to fuel starvation. The helicopter's engine had undergone maintenance over several days preceding the accident. The maintenance was related to fuel coking of the fuel injection manifold. The operator's mechanics removed the engine from the helicopter and separated the modules. Another engine with the identical problem was also undergoing the same maintenance procedure at the time. A repair station technician was contracted to complete the maintenance on both engines. The operator's mechanics and the repair station technician disassembled the accident engine and set it aside. They then performed the required maintenance on the other engine, before returning to complete the work on the accident engine. While working on the accident engine, the repair station technician disassembled module 3, replaced the fuel injection manifold, and then reassembled the engine. This work required that the fuel inlet union be removed and reinstalled.  It is likely that the technician did not tighten the bolts and nuts securing the union with a torque wrench and only finger tightened them. The engine was reinstalled into the helicopter by the operator's maintenance personnel. The repair station technician was serving as both mechanic and inspector, and he inspected his own work. There were no procedures established by the operator or the repair station to ensure that the work performed by the technician was independently inspected. Further, although 14 Code of Federal Regulations 135.429, applicable to Part 135 operators using aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats, states, in part, \u201cNo person may perform a required inspection if that person performed the item of work required to be inspected,\u201d  there is no equivalent requirement for aircraft, such as the accident helicopter, with 9 or fewer passenger seats. An independent inspection of the work performed by the technician may have detected the improperly installed fuel inlet union.In 2008, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) principal maintenance inspector (PMI) for the repair station removed the repair station's authorization to perform work at locations other than its primary fixed location. However, the Repair Station Manual was not updated to reflect this change, and the PMI did not follow up on the change, nor did he log the change in the FAA\u2019s tracking system. The PMI was unaware that, in the year before the accident, the repair station had performed work for the operator at locations other than the repair station\u2019s primary fixed location at least 19 times. The FAA's inadequate oversight of the repair station allowed the repair station to routinely perform maintenance at locations other than its primary fixed location even though this practice was not authorized. The duty pilot performed a 7.5-minute abbreviated post maintenance check flight the evening before the accident. A full maintenance check flight conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's flight manual should, under normal conditions, take 30 to 45 minutes to complete. Had a full check flight been performed, it is likely that the union would have detached from the boss during the check flight. Because the helicopter would not have been operating near its maximum gross weight and the check flight would have been conducted over an open area, the pilot would have had greater opportunities for a successful autorotative landing.",
            "probable_cause": "The repair station technician did not properly install the fuel inlet union during reassembly of the engine; the operator\u2019s maintenance personnel did not adequately inspect the technician's work; and the pilot who performed the post maintenance check flight did not follow the helicopter manufacturer's procedures. Also causal were the lack of requirements by the Federal Aviation Administration, the operator, and the repair station for an independent inspection of the work performed by the technician. A contributing factor was the inadequate oversight of the repair station by the Federal Aviation Administration, which resulted in the repair station performing recurring maintenance at the operator\u2019s facilities without authorization."

The pilot was able to slow the spin rate and performed a hovering autorotation.  A portion of the tail boom impacted a barbed wire fence as the helicopter settled vertically.  Metallurgical examination of the gearbox case fractures disclosed overload features.  Internal examination of the gearbox and gears showed that the pinion and gear teeth had disengaged.  The disengagement lasted a short period of time.  As a result of the disengaged gear and pinion rotating against each other, the gearbox case became overloaded and subsequently separated.

During the engine inspection it was noted that the number 5 exhaust rocker arm was found broken.  Further disassembly of the number 5 cylinder revealed that the exhaust push rod was bent; due to the appearance and length it was determined that it was the intake push rod.  When the exhaust push rod and the intake push rod were placed side-by-side, the intake push rod was the longer of the two and the one that was bent.  Maintenance personnel stated that the only way an intake push rod could be installed in the exhaust side of the cylinder was to loosen the cylinder and pull it away from the case to allow for an increased distance between the rocker arm and lifter.

The pilot requested to land, and then heard a loud noise, followed by the engine cowling opening, and the pilot noted something fly out of the engine compartment followed by a total loss of engine power. Unable to reach the airport, the pilot subsequently made a forced landing in a plowed field. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the number 4 cylinder and piston had separated from the engine in flight and likely departed through the open engine cowling. The crankcase had mechanical damage concentrated at the number 4 and 6 cylinder bay areas. The number 4 cylinder bay area had missing crankcase material, with rubbed and displaced material noted on the cylinder attachment area. Further examination of the remaining cylinders found that the retaining self-locking nuts were loose and had not been tightened or properly torqued.

After returning to the Boise airport, the commercial pilot (examinee in the left seat) transferred control of the aircraft to the check pilot (right seat) who then demonstrated a simulated 180-degree autorotation. After the check pilot rolled off power, the GEN OUT caution light illuminated followed by the ENG OUT warning light. The check pilot noted rotor RPM in the green but decelerating engine RPM, and the commercial pilot reported that he felt the check pilot's flare was premature. The rotorcraft landed hard during which time the main rotor blades flexed down impacting and severing the tailboom. Post-crash examination revealed that the left and right seat throttle/collective controls to the engine fuel control unit had been misrigged, and a test run of the engine confirmed a flameout condition when the right seat throttle was retarded to the idle position. A review of the rotorcraft's maintenance log showed that the right seat controls had been installed two days previous and signed off as \"all rigging found to be within limits.\" The McDonnell Douglas MD500D Rotorcraft Flight Manual discusses throttle rigging in the Normal Procedures Section noting that a throttle rigging check must be performed prior to autorotation training, and the check must be performed on both left and right seat throttle controls if dual controls are installed.

The interagency dispatch system coordinated flight following of the two SEATs from the operator\u2019s airfield directly to the wildfire.  Prior to the flight, the accident pilot checked the weather for the area and declined support to the TA25 wildfire, due to high winds, but accepted a mission to another wildfire, approximately 55 nautical miles east, because of its location relative to wind activity and terrain.  While en route, the dispatch system informed the accident pilot that the airplanes were not needed for the other wildfire, but inquired whether they could support the TA25 wildfire.  Being halfway into their flight, the pilots decided they would at least check out the flight conditions at the TA25 wildfire rather than cancel the mission.  After arriving to the TA25 wildfire, the accident pilot coordinated the drop area with a ground contact, and the second pilot maintained aerial observation support.  The accident pilot performed a dry run over the area and then told the ground contact that the winds and turbulence were too strong to do a drop.  The drop zone was then moved to another location at the TA25 wildfire.  Gusty winds and power line hazards were reported to the accident pilot by the ground contact.  Witnesses observed the airplane drop the load, then enter a vertical climb, stall, and impact terrain.  The last calculated groundspeed of the airplane was 81 miles per hour (mph), and estimated winds at the time of the accident were at least 30 knots and gusting from the southwest.  Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no pre-impact anomalies.  The flaps were found in the full-extended position, and the airplane flight manual for fire control operations recommended a flap setting of 10 degrees.  Representatives of the land management agencies reported to the NTSB that due to the local procurement arrangement for this flight, several levels of personnel typically involved in the decision making and dispatch processes for wildfires, were not involved, and the airplane was not properly configured for aerial fire support.",

During the first test run, the fully-castoring nose wheel began to shimmy, and the pilot appeared to slightly raise and lower the airplane's nose, in what was assumed by witnesses to be an attempt to eliminate the shimmy. Upon reaching the end of the runway, the pilot reversed course and made another test run in the opposite direction. During the second test run, the nose wheel began a significant shimmy, followed soon thereafter by the nose of the airplane beginning to rise. Almost immediately after the nose began to rise, the airplane, in what was most likely an unintended consequence, lifted off the runway. Soon after it became airborne, the airplane's nose lowered, in what appeared to be the pilot's attempt to get it back onto the runway surface. The nose wheel then contacted the runway, and the airplane entered into a porpoising sequence that ultimately resulted in the nose gear strut collapsing. The airplane then slid off the side of the runway, and, after encountering soft terrain, it nosed over onto its back. The reason for the occurrence of the nose wheel shimmy could not be determined. The pilot had a reported history of sinus and migraine headaches, which had previously occurred during flight, requiring the pilot to turn over the aircraft controls to a different pilot. Results of post mortem toxicology testing were consistent with the relatively recent use of two different impairing antihistamines, which are often used to treat sinus symptoms.

As the second tank's contents became exhausted, the pilot, in an attempt to keep the engine running, switched back and forth between tanks a couple of times; however, this proved unsuccessful and the aircraft's fuel supply was now entirely exhausted.  Seeing that he would not make the runway, the pilot landed in a field just short of the runway.

The private pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the planned flight to Greater Rochester International Airport (ROC), Rochester, New York.The airplane was based at ROC and flew uneventfully to SLK earlier during the day of the accident. During the return flight, a witness, who was an airport employee, heard the pilot announce on the common traffic advisory frequency that the airplane was departing on runway 5. No further communications were received from the accident airplane and there were no eye witnesses to the accident. Due to smoke from a postcrash fire, which was observed by pilots in another airplane, the accident airplane was subsequently located about 1830 in a wooded area approximately .5 mile northwest of the departure end of runway 5. The airplane came to rest upright against several trees, oriented about a magnetic heading of 020 degrees. The beginning of a debris path was observed with several freshly cut tree branches. Red lens fragments from the left wing navigation light were embedded in one of the tree branches, consistent with a left-wing-low, nose-down impact. The debris path extended on a course about 195 degrees for 60 feet to the main wreckage, which had been partially consumed by the postcrash fire.The cockpit was consumed by fire and no readable flight instruments were recovered. The right wing remained partially attached to the airframe and exhibited more fire damage near the wingtip. The right flap and aileron remained partially attached to the right wing. The left wing remained partially attached to the airframe and was bent aft and twisted. A section of flap and aileron remained attached and the left wing was consumed by fire. The horizontal and vertical stabilizer remained intact, with elevator and rudder attached, and exhibited fire damage. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the respective left and right aileron sectors to the mid cabin area, with the balance cable intact. Elevator and rudder control continuity were confirmed from their respective sectors at the control panel in the cockpit to their sectors in the empennage. Measurement of the flap actuator corresponded to a flaps-retracted setting and the landing gear actuator corresponded to a landing gear retracted position. Measurement of the rudder trim linkage corresponded to an approximate neutral setting. Measurement of the elevator jackscrew corresponded to an approximate 13.5 degree tab up (50 percent nose down) setting.The propeller had separated from the engine and was located in a crater about 20 feet along the debris. One propeller blade was loose in the hub consistent with impact, while the other three remained attached. The propeller blades exhibited s-bending, chordwise scratching and leading edge nicks. The engine remained attached to the airframe and was separated for examination. Disassembly and examination of the engine revealed rotational scoring on both sides of the compressor turbine disc and blades. Rotational scoring was also observed on the both sides of the power turbine vane and baffle, and first stage power turbine disc and blades on the upstream face. The accessory gearbox and inlet were consumed by postcrash fire.The six-seat, low-wing, retractable tricycle gear airplane, serial number 4697117, was manufactured in 2001. It was powered by a Pratt and Whitney Canada PT6A-42A, 500-horsepower engine, equipped with a four-blade, controllable-pitch, Hartzell propeller.The pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration second-class medical certificate was issued on March 16, 2015. At that time he reported a total flight experience of 4,620 hours; of which, 60 hours were flown during the previous 6 months.The recorded weather at SLK, at 1751, was: wind from 360 degrees at 6 knots; broken ceiling at 6,000 feet; visibility 10 miles; temperature 20 degrees C; dew point 11 degrees C, altimeter 29.99 inches of mercury.The propeller was retained for further teardown examination.",

Title 14 CFR Part 135.225 indicates no pilot may begin an instrument approach procedure to an airport with an approved  weather reporting facility unless the latest weather report issued by that weather reporting facility indicates that weather conditions are at or above the authorized IFR landing minimums for that airport.  The listed minimums for the ILS approach to runway 05 was in part 3/4 mile visibility.  A METAR taken at the destination airport approximately 2 minutes after the accident indicated overcast clouds existed at 100 feet, the temperature and dew point were 4 and 2 degrees Celsius, respectively, and the altimeter setting was 30.16 inHg.  No precipitation was present across Arkansas, Mississippi, or Alabama, and no radar echoes were noted along the accident airplane's route of flight.  The freezing level near the departure and destination airports at the nominal time of 0600 (4 hours 17 minutes after the accident) was 12000 and 14,500 feet mean sea level, respectively.  A witness at the airport reported the fog was the thickest he had seen since working at the airport for the previous year.  The flight was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 05, and the pilot was advised frequency change was approved.  The witness waiting at the airport reported hearing a sound he associated with a shotgun report.  Radar data indicated that between 0138:47, and 0142:11, the airplane was flying on a northeasterly heading and descended from 2,400 feet msl, to 900 feet msl.  At 0142:11, the airplane was located .43 nautical mile from the approach end of runway 05.  The next recorded radar target 24 seconds later indicated 1,000 feet msl, and was .20 nautical mile from the approach end of runway 05.  The touchdown zone elevation for runway 05 is 700 feet msl.  The airplane crashed in a wooded area located approximately 342 degrees and .37 nautical mile from the approach end of runway 05; the wreckage was located approximately 4 hours after the accident.  Examination of trees revealed evidence the airplane was banked to the left approximately 24 degrees, and the descent angle from the trees to the ground was calculated to be approximately 22 degrees.  All components necessary to sustain flight were either attached to the airplane or in close proximity to the main wreckage.  There was no evidence of post crash fire and a strong odor of fuel was noted at the scene upon NTSB arrival.  A 8-inch diameter pine tree located near the initial ground impact sight exhibited black paint transfer and a smooth cut surface that measured approximately 46 inches in length.  The bottom portion of the cut was located 4 feet above ground level.  The flap actuator was found nearly retracted; examination of the components of the flap system revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the flight control system for roll, pitch, and yaw revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the engine and engine components with TSB of Canada oversight revealed no evidence of preimpact failure of the engine or engine components.

The experimental amateur-built airplane was a reproduction of a WWI British bi-wing fighter that was in production from 1916-1918. The pilot noted that the purpose of the flight was to obtain airborne fuel burn data and to further calibrate the airplane's electric fuel quantity gauge. The airplane's fuel tanks had been filled and drained several times during the pilot's previous attempts to calibrate the fuel quantity gauge. The pilot noted that the last time the airplane had been serviced with fuel was 5 days before the accident. He stated that while on initial climb from runway 14, a 5,502-foot-long by 100-foot-wide, about 60 feet above the ground, the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot reported that the airplane stalled as he attempted to restart the engine. The airplane impacted terrain about 60 feet west of the runway, approximately 2/3 down the length of the runway. The right upper and lower wings, the left lower wing, and the forward fuselage primary structure were substantially damaged. A postaccident inspection found no evidence of any usable fuel in the airplane's four fuel tanks. Additionally, there was no evidence of a fuel spill at the accident site. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane or its engine.

The aircraft wreckage was located the following day approximately 2.8 miles from the destination airport.  The airplane impacted terrain in a vertical descent and flat attitude and came to rest upright on its fuselage and wings.  The cockpit and cabin were intact and both wing assemblies remained attached to the fuselage.  Evidence of forward velocity and/or leading edge deformation was not observed to the wings or fuselage.  Mixed ice was noted along the leading edge of both wings.  At the time of the accident, weather conditions were reported as low ceilings and low visibility due to snow and mist.  The accident occurred during dark night conditions.  Air traffic control (ATC) transcripts indicated that shortly after entering the holding pattern at 11,000 feet the pilot was issued an approach clearance for the ILS.  The pilot acknowledged the clearance and approximately two minutes later ATC communications with the pilot were lost.  Pilot logbook records showed that the pilot's total flight time was approximately 1,987 hours.  In the six-month period preceding the accident, the pilot logged approximately 40 hours total time, 9 hours of actual instrument time and 7 instrument approaches in the accident airplane.  The pilot's total night flying experience was approximately 51 hours.  The pilot made no entries in his pilot logbook indicating that he had flown at night in the six-month time frame preceding the accident.

He said he 'may lose the left engine' & that he was unable to maintain altitude. He diverted to an alternate airport. During a right turn onto final approach, the airplane was observed to cross (overshoot) the extended centerline of the runway. It continued in a right turn back toward the centerline, and then entered a left turn to intercept the inbound course. The turn steepened, and then the airplane entered a spin & crashed 1/2 mile short of the runway. A warped flange & evidence of exhaust gas leakage were found on the Inconel exhaust system Wye collector, at the wastegate outlet of the left engine. Neither propeller was in a feather position. There was evidence that the left engine was providing low power during impact. A note on the pilot's clipboard indicated that the (left engine) fuel flow & cylinder head temperature went to zero, & the manifold pressure dropped to 10 inches. The note also indicated that the pilot switched the 'boost pump' to high, the fuel flow went to 260 psi, & manifold pressure increased to 18.5 inches. Calculations showed that the airplane's gross weight (GW) & center-of-gravity (CG) were 7,645 pounds & 158.32 inches. The maximum allowable GW & CG were 7,450 pounds & 158 inches. During impact, the flaps were fully extended. The 'Engine Inoperative Landing' procedure stated, 'Wing Flaps - DOWN when landing is assured.'  Most of the pilot's flight time in the Cessna 421 was before 1985; no record was found of recurrent training in the airplane since 1984.

The airplane was observed to continue flying southbound while circling then the airplane was observed flying low over trees and circled 2 times over a field sparsely occupied by trees.  The airplane then rolled inverted and impacted the ground slightly inverted.  Examination of the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.
