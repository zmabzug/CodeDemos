Examination of the airplane revealed the left main landing gear spring fractured into two sections at the point where the foot-step attached to the spring.  The fractured spring assembly, including the foot-step and bracket, were shipped to a metallurgical laboratory for further examination.  According to the Factual Report, the spring gear fractured at the point where the foot-step was installed to the spring.

Neither the flight instructor nor the pilot under instruction was injured. The instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The helicopter was operated by the Salt Lake City Utah division of Upper Limit Aviation, which was a Part 141 certificated training facility. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no FAA flight plan was filed for the flight.According to both pilots, a portion of the flight was being used to practice landings on, and liftoffs from, snow at a remote LZ, and they had already completed one landing and liftoff at the same LZ. After the second landing, which was uneventful, the helicopter sat on the snow-covered ground for a few minutes before the pilots initiated the next liftoff. Just after engine power application, the right forward skid sank into the snow, and the pilots were unable to arrest the ensuing rollover. Winds at the LZ were light, and the helicopter nose was pointed approximately into the wind for the landing and liftoff attempt. The helicopter was equipped with \"tundra pads\" mounted near the rear downtubes of the landing skids. Initial site examination by company personnel indicated that there was a soft layer of snow about 5 to 6 inches thick, that this overlaid a base of about 12 to 18 inches of more soft snow, and that the two layers were separated by a crust of firmer snow.Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) information indicated that the helicopter was manufactured in 1984, and was equipped with a Rolls-Royce (Allison) 250-C20 series turboshaft engine. The helicopter was recovered from the LZ the day after the accident, and was examined by FAA inspectors. The pilots did not report, and the FAA inspectors did not observe, any indications of any pre-existing mechanical deficiencies or failures.

The two flew a dual flight, and, later that same day, the pilot conducted a solo flight in the same airplane. The next day, the flight instructor and the pilot conducted another dual flight in the accident airplane. During their departure from the origination airport, they noticed that the landing gear retraction time was unduly long, and the flight instructor remarked about it to the pilot at that time. They continued the departure, conducted some airwork, and then the pilot performed a landing at another airport. Both the pilot and the flight instructor described that landing as \"hard;\" however, the flight instructor reported that he had experienced harder landings in that and other airplanes. After landing, the pilots taxied the airplane back for departure, and during the climbout, the landing gear could not be retracted. They cycled the gear to no avail, left it extended, and flew back to the origination airport, where the pilot conducted an uneventful landing. Postflight examination of the airplane revealed that the wing structure near the attach point for the left main landing gear was substantially damaged. Review of the airplane maintenance records revealed that the airplane satisfactorily passed a 50-hour inspection just prior to the dual and solo flights. Review of the airplane flight log revealed that no one other than the flight instructor and the pilot flew the airplane between the inspection and the discovery of the damage. Based on the initial gear retraction anomaly and the flight instructor\u2019s categorization of the subsequent hard landing, it is likely that that landing was not the event that caused the damage. Instead, the damage, which had to have occurred after the 50-hour maintenance inspection, likely happened the day before the damage discovery, and the hard landing during the dual flight was the event that caused the visible external manifestation of the preexisting internal wing structural damage.

After the pilot-in-command performed a simulated forced landing using flaps he was instructed to go around at about 400 feet. During climbout after flap retraction the left flap was observed to be bent and extended about 30 degrees at the inboard end and 10 degrees at the outboard end. The right flap was fully retracted and the flap lever was in the flaps retracted position. The flight returned to the airport for an uneventful landing. During taxi from landing it was found that the left aileron was binding on the bent left flap. During postflight examination of the left flap it was determined the inboard roller was jammed in the track. When pressure was applied to the flap the roller became free and the flap retracted rapidly. After removal of the inboard roller it was found to contain very little lubrication and to have rust on the roller surface.

The pilot contacted the village agent at the destination airport via radio, and received a weather report as 800 feet overcast, with the visibility as 5 miles.  The director of operations for the company reported that the weather at the accident scene was an indefinite ceiling of about 500 feet, and a visibility of about 2 miles.  After departure, the pilot proceeded toward the destination airport about 450 feet above the ground.  About 10 minutes after departure, the pilot said the horizon began to become obscured and the area ahead of the airplane turned white. He said there was no precipitation, rather the ground and sky became indistinguishable. He began a right turn toward the east, but about 2 seconds after beginning the turn, the airplane suddenly collided with snow-covered terrain.  A passenger reported the visibility was about 1 mile under gray skies.  The airplane was equipped with an avionics package provided by the FAA's Capstone Program.  The Capstone Program is a joint industry/FAA demonstration program that features, among others, global positioning system (GPS) avionics, weather and traffic information provided through automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), traffic information service-broadcast (TIS-B) equipment, and terrain information depicted on a multifunction display (MFD) installed in the cockpit.  The Capstone program provides radar-like services to participating air carrier aircraft operating in a nonradar environment of Western Alaska.  Terrain depiction information, based on GPS data, is one of several visual display options available to the pilot on the MFD.  Selection of the terrain mode for display, provides the pilot with color shading depicting areas of terrain that are black (2,000 feet below the aircraft), green (between 2,000 and 700 feet below the aircraft), yellow (between 700 and 300 feet below the aircraft), and red (at or within 300 feet of the aircraft).  Accurate depiction of terrain (in the terrain mode) requires the pilot to manually set a barometric pressure setting in the MFD menu.  The Capstone avionics equipment does not receive barometric pressure data from the aircraft's altimeter.  Selection of the map mode does not provide any terrain awareness information.  During the interview with the NTSB IIC, the pilot said that he selected the moving map display with a five mile scale. He did not observe any warning flags illuminated on the MFD, and he did not manually enter any barometric pressure data into the MFD.  The pilot said that he routinely utilized his own personal GPS receiver that has a color moving map display.  He said he is more familiar with his own GPS, and had it installed on the top of the instrument panel glare shield.  He said that since the terrain in Western Alaska is usually quite flat, he routinely utilized the Capstone map mode with the GPS \"go to\" function for each leg/destination of a route, not the terrain mode.",

Additionally the idle needle valve was found to be fully closed.  When the regulator cover was removed to free the inlet control ball, water stains were observed over a large sector of the control diaphragm.  Removal of the inlet fuel screen revealed that it too had experienced substantial long term water contamination some time in its past.\"  The TBI was reassembled and test run.  The manufacturer stated, \"Data readings of fuel flow and airflow obtained during this test were plotted to reveal a metering curve indistinguishable from a new EFS-2.\"",

The left-seat pilot landed in one of the lakes and then took off. When the airplane was about 400 feet above ground level, the pilot in command, seated in the right seat, announced a simulated engine failure and reduced the power to idle. The left-seat pilot pushed the stick forward to attain an approximately  15-degree nose-down attitude in order to maintain 70 mph and recalled announcing that they were at 70 mph. He then turned left to return to the lake for a landing, as there was no safe place in front to land. Halfway through the turn he visually located the landing spot. Rolling out of the turn into the final approach, in about 10 to 15 degrees of bank, the roll stopped without any change to his flight control inputs. The passenger checked the airspeed and assessed the attitude of the airplane before adding about a third of throttle for additional engine power. At this time, the airplane rolled left and the nose dropped fast. The airplane was low and impacted the water in a vertical position. A witness observed the airplane land and then take off. The plane lifted off and appeared normal until the airplane reached about 100 feet above the water. The airplane dipped to the left and then it seemed to overcorrect itself to the right as it entered the water flat.

The pilot stated that she had not conducted a water landing recently, so she elected to land on the water to maintain proficiency. She said that because the airplane had a tendency to turn left during water landings, she was not comfortable landing it in the lake\u2019s water lane (a confined area). Before landing, the pilot set about 50% right rudder trim to compensate for the left-turning tendency and confirmed that the wheels were in the up position. She noted that her airspeed during the approach was slightly faster than normal. The pilot said that during touchdown, the airplane veered to the left, then to the right, then veered violently to the right, as though it \"caught a float,\" and the right wing struck the water. The airplane then pivoted abruptly to the right, cartwheeled, and began to sink. The pilot was able to escape through a broken side window.Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.The flight in the government-owned, government-operated airplane was a public aircraft operation (PAO). Because the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has no statutory authority to regulate PAOs, the agency\u2019s training program was not subject to civil aircraft requirements. A review of the flight training program revealed that it did not include curriculums, events, or testing and checking procedures. No written maneuvers and procedures guide with acceptable performance standards had been developed. As a result, no standardization existed within the pilot group, and tribal knowledge and experimentation were accepted as part of the organization\u2019s culture. Multiple checklists existed for the airplane, and pilots were allowed to use whichever checklist they preferred. The agency did not, nor was it required to, incorporate best practices and industry standards into its training program and airplane operations, and no FAA oversight was required or provided. The agency\u2019s vendor pilot requirements were substantially higher with stricter standards, and required FAA oversight, compared to those for agency pilots flying similar missions. The pilot had logged 232 flight hours in the accident make and model airplane, including 68 water landings, only 2 of which were logged without an instructor on board. She stated that during her training in the accident make and model airplane, she completed only one step turn. She further stated that during her interagency pilot evaluation/qualification check, step turns were not completed. The pilot said that the check pilot was not comfortable performing the maneuver, so they agreed to sign off the maneuver on the check ride form but did not accomplish the task. Because performing step turns develops a pilot\u2019s skill in maintaining directional control of a floatplane during high-speed water taxiing, if the pilot had received thorough training in performing step turns in the accident make and model airplane, she would have been less likely to lose control of the airplane during landing. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing, which resulted in a collision with the water. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's lack of experience conducting waterborne operations in the accident make and model airplane and the public aircraft operator\u2019s lack of training standardization."

Approximately 23 seconds later, the airplane began to \"drop rapidly.\"  To arrest the descent, both pilots simultaneously applied full power on both engines, and the applicant (occupying the front left seat) increased the airplane's pitch attitude to 12 degrees.

The pilot/owner operated the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. The pilot and passenger were not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight departed Lake County Airport (LKV), Lakeview, Oregon, at 1200, with a planned destination to S12.According to the pilot, during the landing rollout, he applied the brakes, but the airplane did not stop. The airplane continued down the runway, departing the runway surface, and impacted a chain link fence.A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the airplane and reported that the brake fluid reservoir was empty. Upon further inspection, a broken elbow fitting was found on the right landing gear brake assembly.",

The pilot reported hearing a loud bang, followed by the engine spooling down.  The helicopter collided with a chain link fence during the forced landing sequence.  Postaccident inspection of the engine revealed an uncontained second stage turbine wheel burst (on-speed) as a result of oil starvation and subsequent bearing failure.  During the onsite examination, fresh oil residue was noted along the right side of the helicopter's fuselage, tail boom assembly and leading edges of the tail rotor blades.  Oil wetting and staining was also observed on the concrete hangar apron, and a trail of fresh oil extended from apron to the helipad where the helicopter departed.  Additionally, onsite investigators noted that the oil pressure transducer line coupling B-nut (near the foreword bulkhead) was found two flats loose, and four complete rotations from complete separation.  Evidence of oil loss, sooting and localized fire damage was observed in the area of the fitting union.  The accident flight was the helicopter's first flight following the completion of a maintenance action item in the general area of the aforementioned fitting.  Following the maintenance action, an engine run (ground) and post run inspection was completed by a line pilot.  No discrepancies were noted and the helicopter was returned to service.

After one such ride, a pilot, who was acting as a ground crewmember, measured the fuel level in the tanks with a calibrated wooden stick while the engine was running and the rotor blades were turning. He determined that about 8 gallons of fuel remained, which was sufficient for the next ride. About 9 minutes after takeoff, the engine lost power. Witnesses reported seeing the helicopter flying low when they heard the engine \u201csputter\u201d or \u201cpop.\u201d The pilot reported that he performed an autorotation to a field; the helicopter landed hard on sloping terrain and rolled over onto its right side. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the engine lost power as a result of fuel exhaustion. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have prevented normal operation. The helicopter manufacturer provided a wooden stick for pilots to dip a fuel tank during preflight to determine the total quantity of fuel available for flight. A representative of the helicopter manufacturer stated that caution must be exercised when measuring fuel quantity with a stick, because the irregular shape of each fuel tank can make it difficult to interpret the actual fuel quantity at lower levels. It is likely that the pilot who checked the fuel level before the accident flight did not accurately determine the amount of fuel in the tanks.

About 300 feet above ground level, the airplane pitched up to a nose-high attitude and rolled to the right; it subsequently impacted the ground in a right-wing-low, nose-down attitude. Postaccident examination did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or abnormalities that would have precluded normal operation. However, the weight of the airplane (not including fuel) plus the weight of the pilot exceeded the airplane\u2019s maximum gross takeoff weight and the center of gravity (CG) was aft of the most rearward limit. Although any fuel would have moved the CG forward of the most rearward limit, it also would have increased the airplane\u2019s takeoff weight. The pilot reported to his aviation medical examiner (AME) that the airplane was having \u201cgreat\u201d difficulty with longitudinal stability. He also noted that his weight gain caused the airplane to be \u201cover gross,\u201d most likely causing the control problems. The AME advised the pilot to stop flying the airplane.Because the airplane was at or aft of the rear CG limit, it would have been very sensitive in pitch control and may even have been at or near a dynamically unstable flight regime in terms of pitch handling. Accordingly, the airplane would have required more nose-down trim adjustment. Additionally, because stall speeds increase as gross weight increases, the airplane would have stalled at a higher airspeed. Therefore, it is likely that, during the climb, the airplane stalled at a higher airspeed than the pilot would have expected due to its exceedence of the maximum gross weight and that it subsequently entered a spin. A review of the pilot's logbook indicated that he had accumulated only 4.4 flight hours in the 2 years preceding the accident flight with only 0.3 hour in the accident airplane. It is likely that the pilot's lack of experience in the airplane\u00a0make and model contributed to his decision to take off with the airplane in an overweight condition and his inability to understand the seriousness of the situation. Although the postmortem toxicology testing was positive for three drugs used in the treatment of hypertension, none of the medications should have been impairing and were unlikely to have contributed to the accident.

However, the R2-53 relay also exhibited loose terminal studs and several holes that had burned through the relay housing that the other relays did not exhibit. The wire bundles that run immediately below the left and right heat exchanger cooling fans and the ground service tie relays exhibited heat damage to the wire insulation, with the greatest damage located just below the R2-53 relay. The unique damage observed on the R2-53 relay and the wire damage directly below it indicates that fire initiation was caused by an internal failure of the R2-53 relay.  Disassembly of the relay revealed that the R2-53 relay had been repaired but not to the manufacturer's standards. According to the manufacturer, the damage to the relay housing was consistent with a phase-to-phase arc between terminals A2 and B2 of the relay. During the on-scene portion of the investigation, three of the four circuit breakers in the left heat exchanger cooling fan were found in the tripped position.  To determine why only three of the four circuit breakers tripped, all four were submitted to the Materials Integrity Branch at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, for further examination.  The circuit breakers were visually examined and were subjected to an insulation resistance measurement, a contact resistance test, a voltage drop test, and a calibration test (which measured minimum and maximum ultimate trip times).  Testing and examination determined that the circuit breaker that did not trip exhibited no anomalies that would prevent normal operation, met all specifications required for the selected tests, and operated properly during the calibration test. Although this circuit breaker appeared to have functioned properly during testing, the lab report noted that, as a thermal device, the circuit breaker is designed to trip when a sustained current overload exists and that it is possible during the event that intermittent arcing or a resistive short occurred or that the circuit opened before the breaker reached a temperature sufficient to trip the device.",

A demonstration flight includes only low-G maneuvers.  The aircraft, designed for aerobatics, had, since its manufacture, performed aerobatic maneuvers on previous flights.  The maximum allowable gross weight for aerobatics is 1,550 pounds.  The aircraft weighed an estimated at 1,639 pounds at the time of the accident. An agricultural pilot reported seeing the aircraft in a shallow climb about 500 feet agl.  An eyewitness, over a mile from the accident site, heard an engine surging and looked up.  He saw a yellow aircraft flying straight and level, about 1,000 feet agl.  As he watched, something fell from the aircraft, which was followed by a loud boom.  The aircraft pitched up, nosed over, rolled, entering a spin that continued until impact.  The outboard portion of the left wing was found 0.17 miles from the crash site.  The main spar had evidence of a ductile fracture due to a positive overload.  The spar material met design specifications for metal composition and hardness.  There was no evidence of fatigue or corrosion.  The outboard section of the left wing did not exhibit any evidence of aeroelastic divergence.  A flutter test showed the aircraft design was free from flutter to speeds above its design envelope.  Wing load testing showed the wing design was able to support a limit load, +6 g's.  The wing also supported an ultimate load, +9 g's, for 3 seconds without failure.  The Engine Management System nonvolatile memory readout provided data points equivalent to 191 mph in level flight.

The student pilot reported dipping a \u201cfuel stick\u201d into the fuel tanks during the preflight to check the fuel levels. Although the flight instructor noticed that the fuel quantity indicators showed that 20 gallons of fuel were in one tank and 15 gallons of fuel were in the other tank, he did not question the fuel discrepancy. A review of security camera video revealed that the flight instructor did not supervise the student pilot\u2019s preflight inspection nor conduct a walk-around inspection. After departure, the student pilot flew the airplane to another airport for a short- and soft-field training lesson. After 45 minutes of training, they departed for their home airport. Although the flight instructor noticed that the fuel gauges were reading low, he chose to continue the flight. Five miles north of the airport, the engine began sputtering, and the flight instructor took control of the airplane. He turned on the fuel pump and richened the fuel mixture, and the engine started running normally. He then decided to climb to get as much altitude as possible while continuing to fly to the airport.

The flight was scheduled to be a single-pilot operation conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and the pilot-in-command (PIC) had been assigned to the flight. Although the second-in-command (SIC), also a Quest Diagnostics pilot, was not assigned to the flight, he asked the PIC if he could accompany him on the flight to gain familiarization with operations into Teterboro Airport. Typically, the PIC flies the airplane from the left seat; however, the PIC on this flight allowed the SIC to occupy the left seat and fly the airplane. The investigation could not determine if the pilots had coordinated responsibilities for the flight before departure or if the PIC was providing additional training to the SIC during the flight. Radar data indicated that, while on the base leg of the traffic pattern, the airplane had an airspeed of about 204 knots, which exceeded the maximum flap extension speed by more than 50 knots and the maximum landing gear extension speed by more than 80 knots. According to the SIC, during this critical portion of the approach to landing, the nonflying PIC remained focused on providing familiarization of the airport and city environment to the SIC, who was flying the airplane, and the PIC failed to monitor the airplane\u2019s airspeed. After the SIC recognized the airplane\u2019s excessive approach speed close to the runway environment, he attempted to slow the airplane. However, he inadvertently retarded the propeller levers and feathered the propellers instead of retarding the throttle levers. Recognizing the resultant loss of thrust, the PIC challenged the SIC\u2019s actions and stated that both engines had experienced power loss. The airplane\u2019s unfeathering accumulators had been removed; therefore, it was not possible for either pilot to quickly unfeather the propellers and reestablish engine power. Approaching the runway centerline at both low altitude and high airspeed and with the propellers feathered, the pilots were unable to slow the airplane and descend before overflying the runway.

During post-accident investigation of the wreckage, it was noted that the outboard section of one propeller blade was missing.  The inboard section of the Hamilton Standard propeller blade was sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory Division for examination.  It was reported that the blade was fractured approximately 26 to 27 inches from the butt end.  Optical examination of the fracture face found features consistent with fatigue progression over the majority of the fracture.  Closer examinations revealed beach marks and other progression features indicating fatigue initiation at a mechanical dent on the camber surface near midspan.  Further examination indicated that fatigue accounted for approximately 70% of the total fracture area.",

Toward the end of the flight, the engine suddenly lost all power without warning. He switched from the header fuel tank to the right main fuel tank and set up for a forced landing to a hayfield. Just before landing, the engine regained power for about 3 seconds and then again lost all power. The momentary gain in power placed the airplane on a high glidepath for the hayfield.

The mechanic who performed the work did not complete retraction tests of the landing gear and did not approve the airplane for return to service.  The pilot stated that braking action was normal during taxiing, but after takeoff, at approximately 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL), the main gear would not retract and he noticed the hydraulic pressure gauge indicating 0 pressure. He selected gear down, observed three green lights, used the hydraulic emergency hand pump, and turned back to the airport. While operating the hydraulic emergency hand pump, he noticed \"some pressure\" up to 800 psi.  While returning to the airport he moved the emergency hand pump selector valve to \"brake only\" to be able to stop the airplane but reported he did not get any pressure when using the emergency hydraulic pump.  On final approach he slowed the airplane to approximately 85 miles per hour, touched down, and started pumping the hydraulic emergency hand pump for the brakes, with no success.  Unable to stop the airplane, it collided with a ditch beyond the departure end of the runway.  Following recovery of the airplane, the emergency hand pump selector valve was not found in the \"brakes only\" position.  Operation of the hydraulic emergency hand pump with the selector set to \"brakes only\" revealed hydraulic pressure was produced.

About  20 to 30 seconds later, the pilot heard a loud bang and the engine lost total power.  The pilot intentionally ground looped the airplane during a forced landing in an open area in order to avoid a brick wall, fence, and a parking lot containing vehicles and people directly ahead.  Examination of the engine revealed the engine lost total power due to the failure of the No. 1 bearing, which resulted in axial and radial movement of the compressor rotor and severe over temperature damage to the gas path components. The bearing failure was due to electrical arcing between the bearing races and rolling elements.  The electrical arc pitting of the starter-generator gear shaft indicated a direct electrical arcing path from the starter-generator to the bearing. The exact source of the electrical arcing within the starter-generator was not determined.  According to the maintenance records, the starter-generator was replaced 172 hours prior to the accident due to bearing distress.  According to a Transport Canada Service Difficulty Advisory, No. AV-2007-05, dated October 29, 2007, in the PT6A engine, electrical arcing occurrences have caused pitting and subsequent failure of the No. 1 bearing.  Electrical current travels from the defective starter-generator (SG) spline shaft, through the engine accessory drive train to the engine No. 1 bearing causing mild to severe bearing damage such as pitting, grooves, or craters.  The extent of bearing damage, and therefore, the time before failure, is dependent on various factors such as the electrical current, exposure time, bearing load, and rotational speed.  The most common and preventable cause of electrical arcing, is from armature leakage occurring as a result of an accumulation of brush dust.  This dust can provide an electrical discharge path between the commutator and the shaft.  Secondly, a breakdown of the commutator insulation and/or the lamination slots can cause an electrical short.  In order to detect pending failure of the No. 1 bearing, the Pratt and Whitney maintenance manual addresses oil contamination monitoring procedures in the event of starter-generator replacement for electrical reasons.  The oil filter is to be inspected at 100-hour intervals for engine bearing material for 700 hours following starter-generator installation. There was no record of any subsequent oil filter patch checks or other related inspections after the starter-generator change.",
            "probable_cause": "Loss of engine power while maneuvering due to the failure of the number 1 bearing that was caused by electrical discharge damage to the bearing originating from the starter-generator.  Contributing to the accident was the operator's failure to follow the engine maintenance manual procedures for oil monitoring following generator replacement and the unsuitable terrain for the forced landing."

The left-seated pilot, a private pilot, owned the airplane and the right-seated pilot held an instrument rating; it could not be determined who was the pilot-in-command at the time of the accident. The left-seated pilot had a self-induced stress of completing the flight and attending the meeting as he was concerned about his company's financial health. The right-seated pilot's pressure to depart likely stemmed from him dedicating over a year preparing items to be presented in the meeting. The left-seated pilot had great confidence in the right-seated pilot's flying ability and history in operating in inclement environments, which most likely contributed to his decision to depart in poor weather conditions. An audio recording of the airplane just prior to the accident revealed that the engine was producing high power and the airplane was traveling at an airspeed of about 130 knots.

He heard another pilot announce he was departing on runway 16 so when he decided to land, he entered the traffic pattern for runway 16.  He said he was about 10 feet off the ground and at a speed of 10 knots when the helicopter 'just drop[ped] out of transitional lift. . .All of a sudden, [the] tail came up [and the] nose went down.  [I] pulled back and up on [the] collective [control], but could not recover.'  The pilot reported that the wind had shifted from the south to the north, and told an FAA inspector that it 'push[ed] me down and flip[ped] me over.'  The helicopter began to spun, struck the ground, and rolled over. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate weather evaluation, which resulted in a downwind landing, and his failure to maintain aircraft control.  A factor was the tailwind. "
