During the flight, the weather in the area began to deteriorate. Other pilots, ground personnel, and witnesses reported periods of heavy rain and reduced visibility. Infrared satellite imagery for the time period of the accident flight depicted an area of cumulus congestus cloud development over south-central Florida, north of a stationary frontal boundary, moving north. Ground personnel were monitoring the deteriorating weather as the accident airplane continued its mission. Although there may have been discussions of a weather recall, the evidence indicates that this did not occur. The accident pilot likely discontinued his mission and initiated a return to the airport due to the weather conditions. The airplane was not equipped with weather radar. As the airplane approached the airport from the north in night conditions, it encountered the edge of an area of echoes with a maximum core reflectivity of 55 decibels; such echoes are capable of producing severe turbulence and strong outflow winds. The right wing separated in flight, and the airplane crashed inverted in a farm pasture west of the airfield. An examination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of a preexisting mechanical malfunction or failure. All observed fracture surfaces on the right wing showed indications of overstress.",

The airplane rolled into a field and nosed over, coming to rest inverted.  During interviews and in a written report, the pilot stated his opinion that the loss of engine power was due to fuel exhaustion, which he attributed to a propeller change.

After leveling the wings following the turn from downwind leg to the base leg, he attempted to increase power but the engine was unresponsive.  He said that upon realizing the engine was not producing power, he also noticed the fuel flow was low.  At this point, he cycled the magneto switch, switched fuel tanks, turned on the fuel boost pump to \"low\" but there was no change in the fuel flow.  He then turned toward the airport, realized he was not going to make the runway, and elected to land on a golf course driving range north of the airport.  The pilot further stated the landing went well but during the landing rollout, the aircraft hit a berm and nosed over coming to rest inverted. During recovery of the airplane, the main fuel tanks were found to contain about 15 gallons of fuel in each. The auxiliary tanks contained about 5 gallons of fuel in each and the right tip tank contained 1 gallon of fuel. The left tip tank had been damaged by impact forces and contained no fuel. The fuel selector, magneto switch, and electrical master switch were found in the off position. Fire department personnel reported they turned off the fuel selector, magneto, and electrical master switches after the accident. No contamination was found in the airframe and engine fuel systems. All fuel lines were unobstructed. After recovery of the airplane, which required removal of the airplanes wings, a fuel supply was connected to the airplane and engine fuel system. The engine was then started and operated to full power with no evidence of failure or malfunction.

Examination of the engine revealed that the second stage turbine rotor was fractured, separated, and lodged in the back of the engine.  The second stage turbine stator seal plate assembly exhibited warpage.  The evidence was consistent with the warped second stage turbine stator seal plate contacting the second stage turbine rotor, causing the rotor to separate.  Airworthiness directive (AD) 86-08-06 R1 pertained to the accident engine, and required an x-ray inspection of the second stage turbine stator seal plate assembly.

Both aircraft were taxiing for takeoff on Papa taxiway (35 feet wide, ashphalt), which paralleled runway 18 at the Wittman Regional Airport (OSH), Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  The accident occurred during the EAA AirVenture 2006 air show.  The RV-6 pilot reported that he taxied forward on the P-1 taxiway and was directed by the volunteer flag person to taxi south on Papa taxiway.  He reported that he was taxiing behind a green and white, high wing airplane that had TUNDRA painted on the top of the wing.  The Avenger pilot reported he taxied the Avenger south from the warbird parking area toward the P-1 taxiway.  He observed the flag person clear him to begin taxiing on Papa taxiway.  The Avenger pilot reported that the airplane in front of him was a green and white, high wing airplane with TUNDRA written on top of the wing.  He reported that he taxied at a very slow speed with the propeller speed set about 800 RPM.  He reported that the Avenger had no mechanical defects and that the brakes were good.  The Avenger pilot reported that he observed the Tundra pilot taxi off the right side of the taxiway for some unknown reason.  The Avenger pilot reported that he spotted the airplane that was in front of the Tundra airplane, and he stated that he had \"100 yards of free pavement\" in front of the Avenger.  The Avenger pilot reported that when he heard the impact and saw debris flying, he shut down the engine.  He reported that he never saw the airplane that he hit while he was taxiing.  Witnesses reported that the Avenger pilot did not make any \"S-turns\" while taxiing.  The distance traveled by the Avenger from the intersection of the P1 taxiway and Papa taxiway to the impact point was about 1,180 feet.  The relative speed between the Avenger and RV-6 at impact was calculated to be approximately 6.9 knots.  A visibility study of the Avenger and RV-6 was conducted.  The visibility study indicated that an \"Area of No Visibility\" extended from the Avenger's pilot position out to approximately 170 feet.  No part of the RV-6 was visible to the Avenger pilot until it was positioned approximately 170 feet from the pilot in the Avenger.  CAD drawings used in the visibility study demonstrated the following results if an \"S-Turn\" of 10 degrees was performed on the taxiway: With a turn of 10 degrees, the wing of the RV-6 was visible all the way to the area of impact, and the airplane was never wholly within the Area of No Visibility.  A second visibility study was conducted and it confirmed that portions of the RV-6 could be seen from the cockpit of the Avenger all the way to the area of impact when the Avenger was angled 10-degrees from the taxiway centerline.  The Airplane Flying Handbook states the following about taxiing a tailwheel-equipped airplane: \"Since a tailwheel-type airplane rests on the tailwheel as well as the main landing wheels, it assumes a nose-high attitude when on the ground. In most cases this places the engine cowling high enough to restrict the pilot's vision of the area directly ahead of the airplane. Consequently, objects directly ahead of the airplane are difficult, if not impossible, to see. To observe and avoid colliding with any objects or hazardous surface conditions, the pilot should alternately turn the nose from one side to the other-that is zigzag, or make a series of short S-turns while taxiing forward. This should be done slowly, smoothly, positively, and cautiously.\"",
            "probable_cause": "The Avenger pilot's visual lookout was indequate and he failed to maintain clearance from the RV-6.  Contributing factors were the Avenger's restricted visibility and the RV-6."

As ice began to accumulate on the aircraft, the pilot entered a rapid dive to about 9,000 feet, but when he leveled off ice continued to accumulate, and the pilot felt the aircraft was near stalling. About that time he saw an opening in the clouds and observed what he thought was Box Lake. He therefore descended through the hole and found himself in a heavy snowstorm over the lake. He flew around the lake a few times, but could not find a way to escape the instrument conditions. Then, because more ice was accumulating, the pilot made the decision to attempt a precautionary landing near the shoreline of  the Lake. During the touchdown on snow that was ultimately determined to be more than ten feet thick, the aircraft collided with hidden obstructions and flipped over. The pilot was ultimately rescued two days later by snowmobilers who inadvertently came across the wreckage.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadvertent entry into instrument meteorological conditions while maneuvering in the area of rapidly growing cumulus clouds. Factors include the pilot's improper decision to try to out-climb the rising clouds, mountainous terrain, falling snow, icing conditions, and no suitable place on which to make a precautionary landing."

The flight crew was not properly briefed on the forecasted weather conditions for the destination airport, and were not provided with all of the adverse weather information and NOTAMS affecting their route of flight and their destination airport.  The flight crew missed the first approach to runway 17R due to strong crosswinds.  The flight was subsequently vectored for a Category 1 ILS approach to runway 35L.  Level 4 to 5 convective activity with tops to 42,000 feet were present over the destination airport at the time of the mishap.  The flight crew configured the airplane for an \"autoland\" approach with the auto-brakes set for maximum braking.  A strong crosswind to a quartering tailwind prevailed during the flight's final approach and landing.  The airplane touched down 17-feet left of the centerline of the 9,000-foot long ungrooved concrete runway, which was reported to be partly flooded due to its low crown.  The auto-pilot was never disconnected by the flight crew and no attempt was made by the flight crew to abort the landing during the accident sequence.  The tower had previously reported standing water a the intersection of runway 17R and taxiway Delta during the first approach.  The investigation revealed that the runway condition check was conducted by driving a vehicle over the runway centerline for the full length of the runway.  The investigation team was on the runway when another torrential rain shower moved across the airport.  The team was able to observe a rapid manifestation of water pooling on the runway, mostly away from the centerline.  The depth of the water pooling was measured to be at least 7- inches.  The investigation team concluded that the issued \"standing water\" report failed to indicate the severity of the amount of water actually flooding the runway.  Heavy rain showers, sometimes described as \"torrential\" prevailed throughout the area at the time of the accident.  Another weather station, located 29 miles to the southeast, reported 7.64 inches of rain from the tropical storm.  Witnesses reported the airplane produced a \"heavy rooster tail of water\" as soon as it touched down on runway 35L.  Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting personnel that responded to the accident site, reported that despite the location of their fire house, approximately 1/4-mile across the ramp from the resting place of the airplane, the aircraft was not visible due to the heavy rain that prevailed at the time of the mishap.  Some of the first responders reported that \"it was raining sideways\" at the time of the mishap.  Tire marks, similar to \"steam cleaning\" were found on the concrete surface of the runway, from the touchdown point to the point where the airplane exited the left side of the 150-foot wide runway, were consistent with the tires being in a state of hydroplaning.  Nose wheel steering was found to be operational during the landing sequence.  Main tire pressures were found to be within inflation limits (185 to 200 PSI).  Two of the main tires (no. 3 and no. 7) were damaged and deflated during the accident sequence.  One tire showed some discoloration (bluing).  On-board avionics test equipment did not record any faults with the autoland system during the accident flight.  Examination and bench testing of the eight brake assemblies did not reveal any anomalies.  The eight wheel transducers were also tested by the manufacturer and were found to be within limits.  The anti-skid/auto-brake control unit was also tested and found fully functional.  Flight data recorder data, as well as tire prints made by the nose wheel tire on the runway revealed that the inter-connect between the rudder and the nose wheel assembly attempted to steer the aircraft toward the localizer course.

The airplane veered about 100 feet toward the north from the runway's centerline during the initial takeoff climb. The airplane then impacted a telephone pole, while the airplane's vertical stabilizer collided with telephone cables at an estimated height of 25 feet above the ground. The airplane came to a stop and impacted the ground flat. A fire immediately erupted. All on board where able to exit the airplane, two required assistance. The pilot stated that the front seat passenger fueled the airplane and he did not know which tanks were fueled and the amounts.  He estimated the weights of the passenger and fuel. He has flown out of that airport before with 4 passengers during that time of the year. He believed the temperature was about 93-95 degrees Fahrenheit at the time of the accident. He recalls, during the takeoff, that the airplane lifted, climbed, and then stopped climbing. It started sinking, it was not gaining altitude. He elected to select the landing gear up to clean the airplane. He could not recall a loss of engine power. A wreckage examination was conducted by a representative of the Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM), and a representative of the Cessna Aircraft Company with FAA oversight. Examination of both engines did not reveal any abnormalities that would have prevented normal operation and production of rated power. The four magnetos were examined at the TCM facility with NTSB oversight.  Due to the thermal damage to the right engine's magnetos an operational bench test was not possible. With the exception of the thermal damage, no discrepancies were present. The left engine's magnetos harnesses assemble incurred fire damaged and were replaced. An operational bench test was conducted and no discrepancies were noted. All flight control and fuel systems that were not destroyed were examined. The landing gear in the retracted position, the flaps at 10 degrees setting, elevator trim to approximately 5 degrees tab down, and aileron and rudder trim neutral. Vortex generators were observed on the vertical stabilizer. The left fuel value selector was observed in the left main fuel tank position.

A detailed examination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact mechanical anomaly with the airframe, engine, or fuel system that would have precluded normal operation. According to the engine manufacturer, at the minimum allowable fuel flow, the engine had a fuel consumption rate of slightly less than 6 gallons per hour (gph) at 45 percent of rated power to slightly less than 15 gph at 100 percent power. Operators of similarly powered airplanes reported that the engine usually consumes 8.8 to 8.9 gph in a cruise configuration, which did not account for fuel used during taxi, takeoff, and climb. A review of flying club logs and aircraft fueling records revealed that the airplane consumed about 10 gph of fuel during the 12 flights in the month before the accident. According to the airplane manufacturer\u2019s Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook, the performance charts are unfactored, and the effect of conditions not considered on the charts, including wind aloft on cruise and range performance, must be evaluated by the pilot. The handbook recommends that pilots conduct in-flight fuel flow and quantity checks. ",

The helicopter rolled to the left, which the pilot was unable to counter with control inputs, and impacted terrain on the left side.  A post-accident examination of the helicopter by the pilot/builder revealed that a 27.875-inch aluminum control rod was fractured near the middle of the rod.  The control rod was connected between the collective-cyclic mixing assembly and a walking beam that connected to the stationary swash plate of the left side (pilot side) of the helicopter.  The break in the control rod was perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rod.  Examination of the control rod by a metallurgical laboratory revealed the failure was a result of a fatigue crack that had propagated through nearly 75 percent of the control rod.  A portion of the break was polished indicating that the crack had been present for quite some time.  The pre-existing crack in the control rod reduced its strength to a point that allowed the flight control forces to fail the remaining material.  According to the pilot/builder, a break in the control rod would result in flight characteristics consistent with that experienced by the pilot during the accident flight.  The control system has been redesigned by the kit manufacturer as a result of this accident and now incorporates steel control rods as opposed to aluminum ones.",

The private pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The local personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, the airplane had recently completed a 7-year restoration, and at the time of the accident, had logged about 8 hours of flight time since that restoration was completed.The pilot further noted that, on July 18, 2015, after an earlier flight that day, the Kinner B-5 engine lost power on takeoff, but the pilot was able successfully land the airplane. \"We found gas running out of the carburetor and believed the float was stuck. The engine appeared to have drowned by virtue of the rich mixture.\"The airplane was subsequently hangared, and the following week, the carburetor was cleaned and inspected. \"The float was determined to be intact but the float valve was not seating perfectly. It was removed, blued, reseated, reblued, and tested.  The carburetor was reinstalled and found to still be leaking.\"The carburetor was then removed and re-examined, and the float was found to be \"slightly sticking. A modest portion of material was removed from the float bowl where the sticking was occurring, the carburetor was checked in multiple angles, it was reinstalled. It no longer leaked or flooded. Two separate IA's inspected the work.\"On the day of the accident, the airplane was tied down and the engine run for \"an extended period at full throttle to verify there were no operational issues. Fuel was confirmed at 3/4 tank.\"The pilot subsequently took off, climbing the airplane to 50 feet above the runway, then landing it straight ahead to confirm no anomalies. He then made another takeoff, and about 150 feet above the runway, the engine stopped. The airplane was then not in a position to land on the runway, so the pilot landed off runway, and during the landing, the fuel tank ruptured and the engine broke away from the fuselage.",

The pilot reported that while landing the airplane experienced an uncommanded right roll after he advanced engine power to arrest the airplane's descent rate.  The pilot attempted a go-around by adding engine power; however, this exacerbated the airplane's right turning tendency.  The pilot reported he reduced power on both engines, and attempted to bring the airplane back to a level attitude using left rudder and aileron.  The airplane impacted the terrain in a right wing down, nose low attitude.  No anomalies were found with the flight control system during the post-accident examination.  Inspection of the propellers indicate at impact the left engine was producing significantly more power than the right engine.  The right engine was test run and no anomalies were noted with its operation.  All four fuel tanks were found damaged and/or ruptured, which prevented the post-accident determination of the fuel quantity and its distribution.  The airplane was fully fueled (163 gallons) prior to departing on the 2.5 hour flight.  The pilot reported he used the auxiliary fuel tanks during cruise flight, but did not recall if he had switched back to the main fuel tanks prior to landing.  The pilot said that \"as a habit\" he would have normally switched back to the main tanks.  The pilot reportedly turned the fuel selectors to the off position after the accident.  The flight's total fuel burn was approximately 75 gallons, based on an average fuel burn of 30 gallons/hour.  Although the auxiliary tanks hold a total of 63 gallons of fuel, pilots should only expect one hour of operation from the tanks because the engine recovery fuel is returned to the main tanks, not the auxiliary tanks.  The engine manufacturer reports up to 31.66 gallons/hour of fuel is recovered into the two main tanks.  The Cessna 310R Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) recommends the engines be operated on their respective main tanks for the first 90 minutes of a flight, as to allow ample space in the tanks to accept the recovery fuel from operating on the auxiliary tanks.  The POH specifically states that all takeoffs and landings should be made with the fuel selectors positioned on their respective main fuel tanks.",

Additional causes to the accident were the pilot not maintaining aircraft control during the engine failure and his delayed remedial action to the encountered uncommanded roll (VMC roll).

There were minimal propeller marks from the No. 2 (right side) propeller. Examination of the propellers revealed that the No. 1 propeller blades exhibited chordwise scratching and S-bending, consistent with operation at impact, but the No. 2 propeller blades did not exhibit any chordwise scratching or bending, which indicates that the No. 2 engine was not producing power at the time of impact.There was no evidence that the pilot attempted to perform the manufacturer\u2019s published single engine procedure, which would have allowed him to maintain altitude. Contrary to the procedure, the left and right throttle control levers were in the full-throttle position, the mixture control levers were in the full-rich position, neither propeller was feathered, and the landing gear was down. Postaccident examination of the No. 1 engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact malfunction or failure. However, the No. 2 engine's condition would have resulted in erratic and unreliable operation; the engine would not have been able to produce full rated horsepower as the compression on four of the nine cylinders was below specification and both magnetos were not functioning correctly. Moisture and corrosion were discovered inside the magneto cases; the left magneto sparked internally in a random pattern when tested and its point gap was in excess of the required tolerance. The right magneto's camshaft follower also exhibited excessive wear and its points would not open, rendering it incapable of providing electrical energy to its spark plugs. Additionally, the main fuel pump could not be rotated by hand; it exhibited play in the gear bearings, and corrosion was present internally.  When the airplane was not flying, it was kept outdoors. Large amounts of rain had fallen during the week before the accident, which could have led to the moisture and corrosion in the magnetos. Although the pilot had been having problems with the No. 2 engine for months, he continued to fly the airplane, despite his responsibility, particularly as president, director of operations, and chief pilot of the company, to ensure that the airplane was airworthy. During this period, the pilot would take off with the engine shuddering and would circle the departure airport to gain altitude before heading to the destination. On the night before the accident, the director of maintenance (DOM) replaced the No. 1 cylinder on the No. 2 engine, which had developed a crack in the fin area and had oil seeping out of it. After the DOM performed the replacement, he did not do a compression check or check the magnetos; such checks would have likely revealed that four of the remaining cylinders were not producing specified compression, that the magnetos were not functioning correctly, and that further maintenance was necessary. Review of the airplane's maintenance records did not reveal an entry for installation of the cylinder. The last entry in the maintenance records for the airplane was an annual and a 100-hour inspection, which had occurred about 11 months before the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s improper response to a loss of power in the No. 2 engine and his failure to ensure that the airplane was airworthy. Contributing to the accident was the inadequate engine maintenance by the operator's maintenance personnel."

The left wing tip fuel tank (left main) was partially severed from the airplane, breaching the tank. Additionally, the top of the vertical stabilizer and rudder were severed, and a portion of the windscreen was separated. A suggestion was made by the operator that the autopilot trim may have been improperly set, precipitating a nose pitch down upon engagement of the autopilot during the climb.  The airplane continued to fly for about 20 minutes, then impacted in a steep right wing down attitude into a densely wooded area that was surrounded by open terrain. The ensuing fire precluded any determination of engine malfunction, systems' discrepancies, or wire strike damage to the left propeller. No determination of pilot incapacitation was possible because of the post impact fire. Based upon the ground witness statement, the left engine was probably inoperative following the wire strike. The impact attitude was inconsistent with a decreasing speed loss of control with the left engine inoperative. However, the flight control trim settings, left main fuel tank selected, and throttle quadrant settings all may have been indicative of pilot incapacitation that precluded proper emergency procedure response. Additionally, the airplane impacted into a densely wooded area surrounded by flatter terrain absent of tall obstacles. ",

Both aircraft had just landed on runway 21 and were in contact with the ATCT.  The Piper was issued a clearance to taxi by the ground controller, and the Sabreliner had turned off the runway and was issued a taxi clearance by the local controller.  The Piper exited the runway at taxiway A11, and contacted ground control.  A taxi clearance was issued by the controller to proceed southbound on taxiway alpha to parking.  The controller did not advise the pilot of any traffic entering the taxiway from the runway.  At the time the ground controller issued the taxi clearance to the Piper, the Sabreliner was given a landing clearance by the local controller.  The Sabreliner slowed and was preparing to turn off the runway at A7; however, the local controller inquired where the aircraft was parking and subsequently told the crew to taxi forward on the runway, turn off at A5 and taxi to parking, and to monitor ground.  As the pilot of The Piper approached the intersection of A5, she observed the Sabreliner exiting runway 21 and continued taxiing because it appeared that the Sabreliner was stopping and no other instructions were issued by the ground controller.  When the Piper reached the intersection she realized the Sabreliner wasn't stopping and attempted to turn right and avoid the aircraft.  The left wing of the Piper struck the forward avionics bay of the Sabreliner.  The local controller did not advise the crew of the Sabreliner of any traffic on the taxiway.

He estimated the fuel level in the main fuel tanks was 2-3 inches from the top.  He also reported that before the accident flight he had never flown the accident make and model airplane, and that he had not had any flight training in the airplane.  The passengers were boarded, the flight departed and climbed to between 4,500 and 6,500 feet msl.  He leaned the mixture during cruise, and the flight continued.  He began descending when the flight was 12 miles from the destination airport, and he performed the pre landing checks when the flight was 3 miles from the destination airport.  The flight entered left downwind where he lowered the landing gear and turned on the fuel pumps.  When abeam the landing point he reduced power, lowered the flaps 10 degrees, and turned onto base leg.  During the base leg while rolling out of the turn and flying at 600 feet, \"the right engine suddenly came to a stop....\"  He banked to the left to maintain zero sideslip, pushed the mixture, propeller, and throttle controls full forward, and identified the right engine had failed.  He reportedly pulled the right propeller control to the feather position but during the postaccident investigation, the right propeller blades were not in the feather position and there was no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction of the propeller.  The pilot further reported that while pulling the right propeller control to the feather position, the airplane, \"began to yaw right and simultaneously bank right....\"  He moved the left throttle control to idle, and they were on the ground in a span of 6 seconds from the time the right engine quit.  No fuel leakage was noted at the scene, and no fuel contamination was noted in a nearby pond.  Additionally, only residual fuel was noted in the fuel lines in each engine compartment.  A total of 4.0 and 1.5 gallons of fuel were drained from the left and right auxiliary fuel tanks, respectively.  No evidence of preimpact flight control failure or malfunction was noted.  Neither propeller was at or near the feather range at the time of impact.  Both engines were removed from the airplane, placed on a test stand with a \"club\" propeller, and both engines were noted to operate normally during the engine run.  Examination of the right seat in the third row of the airplane revealed the seat frame was bent down on the left side, and all seat feet were in position but distorted; no fracture of the seat feet were noted.  Examination of the seat of the passenger who sustained minor injuries (left seat in the third row) revealed the seatpan was compressed down, and the lapbelt was unbuckled.  The inboard arm rest was bent inward, and the outboard arm rest was bent outward.  The seat frame indicated displacement to the left.  The seat back was twisted counter clockwise, and the left forward seat foot was in place.  The seat and attach structure was certificated for a maximum forward g loading of 9 g's, and a maximum sideward g loading of 1.5 g's.  This does not include a 1.33 margin of safety factor.  The seat and attach structure was tested to ultimate loads in a combined forward, sideward, and upward directions in accordance with CAR 3.390-2.  The same loads were also applied in a downward direction by itself.  The empennage was separated just aft of the aft pressure bulkhead but remained secured by flight control cables.  According to personnel from the airplane manufacturer, the tested load (150 percent limit) for the empennage in negative shear translates to 14.0 g loading.  Based on Cessna Engineering rough calculations, they believe the empennage is capable of sustaining an additional 30 percent beyond what it was tested to, or an estimated 18.2 g's in negative shear loading.",

The commercial pilot was fatally injured and his 3 passengers were seriously injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight that departed Spirit of St. Louis Airport (SUS), Chesterfield, Missouri, about 0738, and was originally destined for Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC), Kansas City, Missouri.The day before the accident, the pilot had flown from MKC to SUS. After landing, about 1207, the pilot told a fixed-base operator (FBO) line technician that he had a depleted battery because of an unspecified charging system malfunction. The pilot, who also was an aviation mechanic, removed the battery from the airplane to have it charged. About 1800, the pilot returned to the FBO with the recharged battery. After reinstalling the battery, the pilot started and ran the engine for about 5 to 7 minutes. Following the engine run, the pilot removed the cowling and began adjusting a subcomponent of the alternator control unit (ACU). After adjusting the ACU, the pilot performed another engine test run that lasted about 10 minutes. Following the second engine test run, the pilot told the FBO line technician that the airplane's ammeter was still showing a slight discharge while the engine was running, and that he was uncomfortable departing at night with a charging system issue. The pilot asked if he and his passengers could stay the night in the pilot's lounge so they could depart early the following morning. The pilot also asked for the airplane to be towed to the self-serve fuel pumps because he didn't want to further deplete the battery with another engine start.The pilot prepaid for 20 gallons of fuel at the self-serve fuel pump. According to the line technician, the pilot nearly topped-off the right inboard fuel tank with 13 gallons before switching over to the left inboard tank. Upon a visual inspection of the left inboard tank, the pilot told the line technician that it contained less fuel than he had expected. The pilot proceeded to add the remaining 7 gallons of the prepaid 20 gallons to the left inboard fuel tank. The line technician noted that after fueling the left inboard fuel tank, the fluid level was about 2 inches from the top of the tank. The pilot did not purchase any additional fuel and told the line technician that both outboard \"auxiliary\" fuel tanks were nearly full. The line technician then towed the airplane back to the ramp for the evening. The line technician reported that the airplane departed FBO ramp the following morning.According to one of the surviving passengers, while enroute at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet mean sea level, the flight encountered a line of \"dense clouds\" near Sedalia, Missouri. The pilot attempted to navigate beneath the clouds, at an altitude of about 1,500 feet msl, before deciding to make a course reversal and locate a nearby airport to divert to. The pilot told the passenger, who was seated in the forward-right seat, to be on the lookout for towers and obstructions because of their low proximity to the ground. The passenger reported that after flying east for a few minutes the pilot identified VER on his tablet computer. The flight approached the airport traffic pattern from the west and made a left base-to-final turn toward runway 36. The passenger reported that the pilot extended the landing gear without any difficulties. However, when the pilot reduced engine power, in attempt to reduce airspeed, the engine experienced a loss of power. The pilot was able to briefly restore engine power by advancing the throttle, but the engine quickly lost total power. The passenger reported that the pilot then began making rapid changes to the engine throttle and mixture control without any noticeable effect to engine operation. The passenger stated that the airplane eventually \"stalled completely\", about 250 feet above the ground, as the pilot prepared for a forced landing; however, the passenger did not recall the airplane impacting terrain.A postaccident examination revealed that the airplane impacted a harvested soybean field on a 305 degree magnetic heading. The initial point of impact consisted of three parallel depressions in the field that were consistent with the spacing of the accident airplane landing gear. The main wreckage was located about 24 feet from the initial point of impact in an upright position. The accident site was situated along the extended runway 36 centerline, about 0.4 miles south of the runway approach threshold. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit controls to the individual flight control surfaces. The electric master switch was found in the \"on\" position. The wing flaps were observed to be positioned about 1/2 of their full deflection. The landing gear selector switch was in the \"down\" position; however, all three landing gear assemblies had collapsed during the accident. The main fuel selector was found in the \"off\" position; however, a first responder had moved the fuel selector from the \"auxiliary\" position to the \"off\" position during rescue efforts. The first responder also turned the engine magneto/ignition key to \"off\" and disconnected the battery terminals after hearing the sound of an electric motor located under the floorboards. (The sound of an electric motor was later identified to be the electrohydraulic motor for the landing gear extension/retraction system.) The auxiliary fuel tank selector was found positioned to the \"right\" auxiliary wing tank. (The auxiliary fuel tank selector had two positions, \"right auxiliary\" or \"left auxiliary.\") The electric fuel pump switch was found in the \"off\" position. There were no anomalies identified during functional tests of the electric fuel pump and the aerodynamic stall warning system.The airplane was equipped with two inboard \"main\" fuel tanks and two outboard \"auxiliary\" fuel tanks. The reported capacity of each inboard fuel tank was 19 gallons, of which 15.5 gallons were useable per tank. The left inboard tank contained about 5 gallons of fuel. The right inboard tank contained 3-1/2 pints of fuel. The inboard fuel tanks appeared to be undamaged and there was no evidence of a fuel leak from either tank. The reported capacity of each outboard \"auxiliary\" fuel tank was 17 gallons; however, those tanks were placarded for level flight only. The outboard fuel tanks also appeared to be undamaged and there was no evidence of a fuel leak from either tank. A visual inspection of the left outboard tank confirmed that it was filled near its capacity. The right outboard tank contained about 11 gallons of fuel. No fuel was recovered from the fuel supply line connected to the engine-driven fuel pump inlet port; however, the fuel gascolator drain had fractured during the accident and there was evidence of a small fuel spill underneath the gascolator assembly at the accident site. Only trace amounts of fuel were recovered from the engine-driven fuel pump outflow fuel line. No fuel was recovered from the fuel supply line connected to the flow-divider assembly.The engine remained partially attached to the firewall by its engine mounts and control cables. Internal engine and valve train continuity was confirmed as the engine crankshaft was rotated. Compression and suction were noted on all cylinders in conjunction with crankshaft rotation. The upper spark plugs were removed and exhibited features consistent with normal engine operation. Both magnetos provided spark on all leads when rotated. There were no obstructions between the air filter housing and the fuel control unit. Mechanical continuity was confirmed from the engine components to their respective cockpit engine controls. The postaccident examination revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal engine operation.According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control data, the accident flight departed SUS around 0738. According to local law enforcement, the initial 911-emergency call was received at 0901. As such, the accident flight, from takeoff to the accident, was at least 1 hour 22 minutes in duration.

The fatigue had propagated significantly into the wall thickness of the end cap and through the thickness at one location.

The timing of the end cap inspection was in compliance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. Examination of the microstructure of the material revealed that the longitudinal grain direction was oriented parallel to the shuttle valve bore in the end cap. Resistance to fatigue can be improved by aligning the principle tension stresses in the end cap with the longitudinal grain direction.

He then initiated a descending right turn toward a saturated marshy field.  At 20-30 feet above the ground the helicopter started an uncommanded right turn, so the 5,000-hour pilot lowered the collective, rolled off the throttle, and deployed the skid mounted emergency floats.  The helicopter rotated approximately 270 degrees and landed \"hard.\"  The pilot recalled the power setting was at 87 percent when the event began.  Initial on-site examination of the helicopter by the operator revealed a hole on the top of the tail boom driveshaft cover adjacent to the #5 hangar bearing position (above the horizontal stabilizer).  The 6-inch long by 3-inch wide hole was large enough to clearly view a separation of the tail rotor driveshaft at the #5 bearing position.  Examination of the helicopter revealed that the #5 driveshaft segment was fractured at its forward end adjacent to the journal for the #5 hangar bearing.  The initial fracture appeared to occur in the journal for the #5 bearing adjacent to the coupling adapter (commonly called the \"Thomas Coupling\").  The outer ends of coupling lugs and the Thomas coupling lugs exhibited wear where they had contacted the inner portion of the tail boom drive shaft cover.  The forward half of the fracture appeared to have been worn after the initial fracture occurred.  The splined end of the #5 driveshaft segment remained in the coupling adapter at its forward end.  Some material was missing from the forward half of the fracture on the splined end of the shaft.  The fracture face exhibited a \"broom straw\" appearance consistent with the fracture occurring at or near the melting point for the material.  The driveshaft material was made from 2024 aluminum alloy.  The retainer ring for the #5 hangar bearing was found plastically deformed and out of its housing, and the cage in the bearing was fractured with the 13 balls (all balls were present as per the engineering drawing).  The bearing exhibited overheating signatures.  The balls and inner ring exhibited thermal discoloration.  The inner ring appeared to have aluminum galled to the surface, and micro-examination of a section though the inner ring revealed the heating had progressed from the ball path to the inner diameter of the ring.  The bearing shields were deformed and the elastomeric seal was missing from the shields.  An intact ring of the elastomeric lip apparently torn from one of the shields was present.  The edge of the elastomeric seal that had been adjacent to the bearing inner ring showed evidence of thermal distress on the edge that was against the inner ring.  The bearing cage halves displayed fractures at the spot welds, and segments of the cage halves were fractured.  Fatigue fractures were found at two cage welds.  Grease samples at hangar bearing #5 were taken from the bearing's forward face, aft face, and grease holes in the outer ring.  These samples, when tested, were found to be chemically similar to \"Royco 13\" (Mil-G-25013) grease that was specified for use in the bearing (p/n 407-340-339-101).  After the accident,  the manufacturer issued an Alert Service Bulletin No. 407-04-63 that outlines procedures for the replacement of bearings using \"Royco 13\" grease with new bearings that uses Mobile 28 grease.  Readily identifiable colored seals differentiate between the bearings with regard to the type of grease.  Bearings with Royco 13 grease have a light blue seal, and bearings with Mobile 28 grease have an orange seal.  Additionally, a new part number for bearings with Mobile 28 grease was assigned, p/n 407-340-339-107.  According to the manufacturer, Mobile 28 grease is more tolerant to heating.",

He noted little puffs of black smoke, coming out of the stacks around the fuselage, and since there was a heavy forested area ahead, he said he turned the airplane toward a field, to affect a landing. The approach and landing flare/touchdown were uneventful, but during the landing rollout the airplane impacted a ditch, and incurred substantial damage.

Minutes later, the left engine began to surge again.  She was able to substantially restore power to the left engine.  During approach to landing, the power on the left engine began to surge again, followed by a partial loss of power.

Examination of the engine control unit's nonvolatile information revealed there was no rpm exceedence, and in fact there was an underspeed situation recorded, which was attributed to a high engine rpm indication.

At the time of the incursion, the LC was also the front line manager (FLM). VM206 was holding short of runway 19R at the midfield taxiway C waiting to back-taxi toward the approach end of the runway for departure. One of four vehicles was holding behind VM206 on taxiway C waiting to cross the runway from west to east, and three other vehicles were on taxiway S waiting to cross the departure end from east to west. After landing traffic cleared runway 19R, the LC/FLM cleared VM206 for takeoff from runway 19R at taxiway C, permitting the use of the full runway for takeoff. VM206 entered runway 19R at taxiway C, turned left and taxied approximately 500 feet toward the approach end of the runway, turned, and commenced the takeoff roll. As VM206 was turning and beginning its takeoff roll, the GC asked the LC, \u201cam I crossing?\u201d. The request was not made on a recorded landline as required by local air traffic control directives. The LC responded to the GC on the recorded land line, \u201cYou\u2019re not crossing.\u201d The GC then instructed the vehicles to cross the departure end of the runway. The vehicle operator who was holding behind VM206 again requested clearance to cross. The GC, performing tasks associated with CD, stated in her interview that she cleared the vehicle to cross runway 19R without visually scanning the runway. According to the controllers interviewed, the Airport Movement Area Safety System did not alarm. The LC noticed the vehicle cross the departure end and directed the GC to stop the vehicle. However, the vehicle was nearly across the runway by the time the GC instructed them to stop. The vehicle operator continued across the runway until clear of runway 19R. FAA Order 7110.65, \u201cAir Traffic Control\u201d states that the LC has primary responsibility for operations conducted on the active runway and must control the use of those runways. The GC is required to obtain approval from the local controller before authorizing an aircraft or a vehicle to cross or use any portion of an active runway and advise the local controller when the coordinated runway operation is complete.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the ground controller to coordinate the runway crossings with the local controller and her failure to scan the runway prior to issuing the crossing instructions. Contributing to the incident was the combination of the front line manager/tower supervisor and the local control position, which prevented diligent oversight of the tower cab operations."

After seeing the wind socks were hanging limp (no wind), he initiated his approach to runway 18. While on final approach , the pilot realized that he was \"coming in a little high,\" so he slipped the aircraft in order to lose altitude.

According to the pilot, a slight tailwind seemed to come up while he was on final approach. The approach to runway 18 (the recommended landing direction) was made up the narrow Selway River Canyon and is a \"blind approach.\" The first 400 feet of runway 18 is \"very rough,\" and the Idaho Airport Facility Directory  states that \"inexperienced pilots\" should use this field for emergencies only.
