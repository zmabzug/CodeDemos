The airplane was flown by another pilot during that filming, which was accomplished on the day of the accident. After the filming, the airplane was fueled, and the pilot and his family departed on their return trip. En route to the destination, the pilot diverted to another airport because one of the children did not feel well. They spent about 20 minutes at that airport, and then re-boarded the airplane to complete the trip. Engine start, runup, and the takeoff roll were normal, but when the airplane was about 100 feet above ground level, the engine began to lose power. The pilot pushed the nose down to maintain his target airspeed, but the airplane continued to decelerate. The pilot then landed straight ahead in a plowed field off the end of the runway. Initial examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any preimpact discrepancies that would have precluded continued flight. \u000b\u000bNormal procedures call for the takeoff to be conducted with the electric fuel boost pumps operating and then switched off during the climb. The pilot reported that the boost pump switch was on for takeoff and that he did not turn it off before the engine power loss. Postaccident engine test runs revealed that the engine would not run at high rpm without the boost pumps operating. Further examination and testing revealed that a fuel check valve, designed to ensure sufficient fuel flow to the carburetor when the fuel boost pumps were not operating, did not function properly due to a deteriorated gasket. As a result, fuel from the engine driven pump could be pumped back into the fuel tanks instead of into the carburetor. Although the engine test runs demonstrated that, due to the failed check valve, the engine would not run at high rpm without the electric boost pumps, the investigation was unable to determine why the deteriorated check valve did not manifest itself on previous flights. Because the pilot reported that he did not turn off the boost pumps on the accident flight, the defective check valve likely did not cause the loss of engine power. \u000b\u000bA chart for carburetor icing potential indicated that conditions were conducive to icing at glide and cruise power. Even if the airplane had developed carburetor ice on the approach, it is likely that the 20 minutes spent on the ground, at an ambient air temperature of 33 degrees, would have melted that ice. The fact that the power loss occurred with the engine at takeoff power suggested that while takeoff carburetor ice might have been possible, it was not likely. The temporary nature of carburetor ice, combined with the fact that the airplane was not examined in detail immediately subsequent to the accident, precluded the investigation from determining whether carburetor icing was present at the time of the power loss. \u000b\u000bFinally, because the fuel quantities in the low-wing airplane were relatively low, the resultant head pressure in the fuel lines would be low. This, in combination with the hot engine and the 20-minute ground time on a hot ramp at an airport with an ambient temperature of 33 degrees C, could have precipitated partial or full vapor lock in the fuel system, which did not manifest itself until the takeoff demanded full power and maximum fuel flow. The investigation was not able to determine whether the source of the power loss was fuel system vapor lock or carburetor ice. ",

Evaluation of the flight data recorder information revealed that the left engine experienced four Type II (compressor stall) PF events, and the right engine experienced one Type I (partial/full quenching of the engine's combustor flame) PF event and one Type II event.  The flight descended, the power fluctuations ceased, and the flight proceeded to land at its intended destination.  The Saab 340 fleet has undergone extensive research, with regards to power fluctuations, since it was certified in the U.S. in 1985.  In 1985, it was determined that ice accumulates on the engine inlet splitter lip, breaks off, and enters the engine resulting in a flame-out.   An auto-ignition system was developed to provide a means to re-light the engine.  Aircraft certification rules require that no accumulation of engine inlet ice occur that will adversely affect engine operation.  In 2000, the FAA's position was that even though no re-design of the engine inlet was found that would preclude ice accumulation on the splitter lip, the risk associated with a PF event was acceptable.  Furthermore, the FAA determined that the risk of a dual engine power loss due to the existence of an icing condition and failure of both engines' auto-ignition systems was acceptably low.  Lastly, the FAA stated that inappropriate crew response risks associated with PFs combined with an in-flight shut down were quantitatively indeterminate, but deemed qualitatively acceptable by FAA certification pilots and human factors specialists.",

In a 40-degree flap configuration, with reverse thrust, the required landing distance for the airplane was 2,013 feet. In a configuration of 30 degrees of flaps, and no reverse thrust, the airplane required 2,933 feet of landing distance.

A fly-by was requested and the controller informed the pilot that  the nose gear was extended,  however the main landing gear was not extended. The pilot entered the traffic pattern and made an emergency landing to the sod area left of runway 04.  The landing gear actuator was forwarded to an authorized repair station for further examination. The examination revealed the actuator was in the partially extended position during the gear up landing. The repair station confirmed the hydraulic pump was functioning, and the landing gear actuator was in the partially extended position during the gear up landing.  The teardown concluded, \"It is our professional opinion, based on non-teardown of the unit that the power pack would have functioned and sequenced as designed; however, there is serious question as to the ability of the main gear actuators to overcome the flight loads if operated at 60 percent (fluctuating between 750 psi and 900 psi) of designed system pressure (required to be at 1950 plus or minus 50 psi.\")",

The glider pilot reported that the airplane made two passes by the glider.  When the airplane passed by the glider for the second time, it was \"in coordinated flight,\" with the flaps up, and it was either flying level or descending slightly.  At the time, the glider was at an altitude of about 8,900 feet and had a ground speed of about 57 knots.  The glider pilot lost sight of the airplane as it proceeded north into a cirque or bowl formed by a mountain range (peak elevation about 9,600 feet) running north to south and a transverse range (peak elevation 8,916 feet) running west and then hooking south.  The glider pilot and passenger did not witness the accident.  However, the glider did enter the bowl about 90 seconds after the airplane had passed the glider.  The glider pilot executed a left 180 degree turn in the bowl.  During the turn, the glider was at altitudes of 9,100 to 9,200 feet and encountered an air mass that was sinking about 100 to 200 feet per minute.  The surviving passenger, who was seated in the left rear seat, reported that as the airplane made the second pass on the glider, the stall warning indicator sounded.  The pilot dropped the nose to level out, and the stall warning indicator stopped sounding.  The passenger heard a high-pitched whine that sounded like a noise he had heard during the preflight check.  He thought it was the sound of the flap motor, but when he looked out, he saw that the flaps were not moving.  He could not see the pilot moving the flap control, and neither the pilot, nor the other passengers made any comments about the flaps.  The pilot then initiated a descending left turn.  During this turn, the pilot looked over his shoulder and, in a normal tone of voice, said, \"hang on, we might get a couple of trees on this one.\"  It was about 10 to 15 seconds from the time the stall warning horn stopped sounding until they hit the trees.

About 51 minutes into the flight, while about 2,200 ft above the ground, the engine rpm began to decrease. The pilot attempted to restore power by repositioning the fuel selector, turning on the auxiliary fuel pump, pushing the throttle, and verifying that the mixture control was full rich; however, none of these actions restored engine power. The pilot declared an emergency to the tower air traffic controller, who then provided a vector to a nearby airport. The pilot was unable to visually locate the airport and recognized that he would be unable to land there, so he maneuvered for a forced landing on an expressway. The onboard camera showed the propeller stop while the airplane was on approach and the pilot turn off the fuel selector. The pilot subsequently landed the airplane hard on the expressway, which caused substantial damage to the airplane. Following recovery of the airplane, 45 gallons of uncontaminated fuel was drained from both fuel tanks; however, fuel system components in the engine compartment contained minimal fuel, consistent with fuel starvation. Although the airplane was equipped with an engine monitor that records and retains engine parameters, it did not record fuel flow. However, the engine monitor did record a sudden and equal decrease in the exhaust gas temperature and cylinder head temperature for all of the cylinders, consistent with the loss of engine power described by the pilot.

He made a forced landing in a nearby pasture; however, the airplane struck a railroad track during the landing roll, and a postcrash fire ensued. Examination of the radial engine revealed that the connecting rods for the pistons in cylinders 3 and 8 had failed, resulting in significant internal engine damage and the partial loss of power. Examination of the remains of the connecting rods for both cylinders revealed wear signatures that were mostly consistent with engine operation after failure. Because the engine continued operating after the failure, most features on the connecting rods fracture surfaces were obliterated, which made it difficult to identify the initial failure. However, further examination of the inside diameter surfaces of the wrist pin bearing of the number 3 cylinder connecting rod revealed wear signatures consistent with normal engine operation. Based on this finding, it is most likely that the event was initiated by the failure of the number 3 piston rod because it was not affected by the continued operation of the engine. The design of the engine's fuel priming system was such that cylinder number 3 was prone to piston hydraulic lock due to its low position within the priming system. Hydraulic lock is caused by excessive fuel being injected into a cylinder prior to engine start, and can be caused by either excessive priming, or a failure in the plunger or check valve assemblies, either of which could result in fuel trickling from the lowest nozzle within the system during non-operation. Postaccident fire damage precluded a thorough examination of the plunger and check valve assemblies. Hydraulic lock can result in a bent connecting rod and subsequent rod failure. The airplane was a low wing type, with integral wing fuel tanks located below the engine, and as such, it is unlikely that fuel had leaked into cylinder number 3 during non-operation.",

The pilot reported that the power loss was sudden, and there had been no prior indications of a decreasing electrical power reserve such as dimming lights and fading or unreadable radios.  The pilot circled and attempted to rectify the problem without success.  He then decided to return to the airplane's home airport.  As he entered the traffic pattern, the pilot and passenger visually examined the position of both the right and left main gear, which appeared to be in the down and locked position.  The pilot then extended the hand pump, pumped it a few times, and felt strong resistance from the system.  About 2 seconds after touchdown, the airplane shuddered, and then veered off the right side of the runway.  After exiting the airplane, the pilot noticed that the right main landing gear had folded under the fuselage.  A recovery crew lifted the airplane by a sling, and manually extended the right main gear into the down and locked position, where it remained during towing operations back to the pilot's hangar.  The emergency section of the POH under the emergency gear extension section says to pump the hand pump until \"strong resistance is felt.\"  Without electrical power, the landing gear warning lights and horn do not work and the pilot would have to rely on a visual inspection of the main landing gear to determine if they were in the down position.  Post accident inspection of the electrical system revealed that the alternator switch contact was not functioning properly.  This resulted in a lack of field current and eventual complete discharge of the battery.",

During the landing flare, the airplane's right wing impacted a tall sign post, but the touchdown and roll out were successful. A Federal Avaiation Administration inspector examined the airplane on scene and found that the right tank was empty and the left tank contained 15 gallons. The pilot told the inspector that he failed to use a checklist during the restart attempt and, as a result, forgot to activate the required fuel boost pump after switching tanks. After the airplane was recovered and fuel was placed in the left tank, the engine was successfully run with the fuel selector on the left tank.",

He decided to conduct a precautionary landing on a highway, but, while setting up for the landing, the engine experienced a complete power loss.  The pilot landed the airplane uneventfully on the flat desert terrain. After he secured and exited the airplane, a fire developed in the engine compartment and consumed most of the airplane.

The crew chief recharged the blade with nitrogen and allowed the helicopter to remain parked overnight.  The next morning he checked the BIM and found it had retained its charge.  The crew of the accident aircraft, who were accompanied by the company's chief pilot in a second aircraft, made the decision to continue to fly the helicopter to its destination. There were several cellular calls both to and from the operator on the evening before the accident.  A new exclusive-use contract for both aircraft was already in effect.  The maintenance history of the green blade contained an unspecified minor repair after a reported overhaul.  The operator stated that, at no time, had it performed any maintenance or repair to the blade.  After the blade's mating fracture surfaces were examined, it was found that a hole had been drilled from the underside into the spar.  The hole terminated at a conical point that is consistent with a drill bit.  Fatigue banding could be seen in the immediate vicinity of the hole.  Striations near the conical point, typical of fatigue, were seen with a SEM.  The drill hole was under a blade pocket and had not been visible during previous inspections.  There is no prescribed inspection/maintenance procedure short of removing the blade pockets that would have revealed the hole.  Blade pockets are condition items.

In his written statement the pilot attributed the lack of aircraft performance to; a high density altitude (estimated to be 7,698 MSL) and a 10 knot tail wind during takeoff.  He also reported that the propeller control knob was incorrectly set to a high pitch low RPM setting during takeoff, and that he had not completed the before takeoff checklist prior to departure.  The before takeoff checklist procedures for the Cessna 182P, as published in Section four of the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), specify that the propeller be placed in the \"high RPM (full in)\" position before takeoff.

During the engine start, one of the two linemen providing ground services to the airplane departed the ramp area leaving one lineman alone, which the operator allowed for normal ground servicing operations. After completing the engine start, the copilot gave the disconnect ground power hand signal to the lineman. The lineman responded with the hold hand signal and then moved to the left and rear of the airplane to disconnect the ground power unit (GPU).

The pilot then looked out the window and realized that the airplane was moving forward. The pilot took the controls, applied the brakes, and set the parking brake. The pilot did not have visual contact with the lineman, so he asked the two crewmembers seated in the cabin to locate him, and one of the crewmembers reported that she saw him standing next to the GPU.

The pilot performed an autorotation to an island peninsula located on a nearby river. The landing flare eliminated the helicopter's forward movement and touchdown was made on both skids. The helicopter remained upright momentarily before the right skid sank down into the muddy terrain. The helicopter subsequently rolled over onto its right side. The vertical stabilizer, tail boom, and all five main rotor blades were substantially damaged.Postaccident engine inspection revealed that one airfoil (blade) had separated near the rim of the fourth-stage turbine wheel. The fracture initiated at the airfoil trailing edge root fillet and propagated in high-cycle fatigue until finally separating in mechanical overload. No machining anomalies were noted at the fracture origin area. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of all the observed fractures revealed no metallurgical or geometric anomalies at the fracture origin. Material properties near the fracture origin were consistent with the engine manufacturer's specifications. All additional damage throughout the engine was secondary to the airfoil separation from the fourth-stage turbine wheel.The fourth-stage turbine wheel had accumulated 2,918.7 hours and 1,718 cycles since new. The turbine wheel was the current design used in the Series II \"Enhanced\" Power Turbine assembly. The enhanced power turbine design was used in a variety of fixed-wing and rotorcraft aircraft. There have been five known airfoil separations with the enhanced power turbine design, four of which occurred the same model aircraft.A root cause investigation revealed the possibility of a higher stress state in the turbine wheel airfoil trailing edge root fillet than was originally modeled when the turbine wheel was released in 1999. This elevated stress state, which was modeled to occur during engine startup, was the result of a thermal gradient in the turbine airfoil geometry. This thermal gradient could result in a residual stress condition in the airfoil hub trailing edge, and potentially lead to the initiation of fatigue crack. If a crack was initiated, operation of the engine in a wheel resonance mode may propagate the existing crack in high-cycle fatigue and ultimately result in an airfoil separation. The wheel resonance mode occurred during sustained engine operations between 75 and 88 percent N2. This engine speed avoidance range had been previously communicated to operators in the form of an alert bulletin that was originally issued in December 2006, approximately 10 months before the accident. According to the helicopter operator, upon the bulletin's release, they had adhered to the specified speed avoidance range during all flight and maintenance operations.In response to this accident and other similar wheel failures, the engine manufacturer issued an alert maintenance bulletin that required the one-time inspection of the third and fourth stage turbine wheels for possible airfoil cracks. The bulletin was applicable to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter models equipped with a Series II \"Enhanced\" Power Turbine Design. The bulletin stated that prolonged engine operation in the 75-88 percent N2 speed avoidance range could result in airfoil fracture and possible separation. The inspection was to be completed at the next 1,750 hour overhaul and required the removal of the applicable turbine wheels for fluorescent-penetrant and visual inspections. The bulletin called for the replacement of any wheel that contained a fracture of an airfoil trailing edge near the rim where the fillet engages the trailing edge.To mitigate future turbine wheel airfoil fractures, the engine manufacturer has redesigned the turbine wheel to adequately accommodate the higher thermal gradient encountered during engine startup. As of January 2011, the required design changes have been approved and the new wheel design will be deployed during the fourth quarter of 2011.",

The purpose of the flight was to conduct simulated engine out landings.  Both pilots estimated the wind as coming down the runway about 5-10 knots.  The student had landed two previous times with no problems noted by him or the CFI.  On the third landing the CFI simulated an engine out.  When the student entered onto the final leg of the approach he noted that the winds had increased, or were stronger than expected.  He informed the CFI that he was not going to add the second notch of flaps because of the increased drag.  On short final he estimated that at his current altitude and airspeed, with the given wind condition, he would not be able to make the landing.  He called out a go-around, and was instructed to continue the approach.  The CFI then added the second notch of flaps.  He adjusted his airspeed to compensate for the increased drag and noted that the airplane was rapidly losing altitude.  He called out for a go-around and advanced the throttle full forward; however, the airplane continued to sink.  The CFI thought they had encountered a wind shear event, from a straight headwind to no wind at all.",

She descended to 800 feet and prior to turning base leg she slowed to between 65 and 70 knots, which she maintained on base and final.

The airplane travelled onto a portion of the runway that causes undulations and with aft stick applied after encountering the undulations, she tapped the brakes. The airplane then nosed over. She further reported that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the airplane that caused the nose over, and the area of the runway where the undulations were located also was not the cause of the accident.Various video recordings depicted the approach and nose-over sequence; however, the actual touchdown point was not captured.An individual at the accident airport provided a reference for where the airplane came to rest, which was located before a diagonal line that is visible in a Google Earth image.Plotting on Google Earth of the pilot reported touchdown point indicates that position was located about 800 down the 2,200 foot long grass runway, which has the west 500 feet described as being unsuitable for takeoff or landing due to uneven surface.

Postaccident examination of the landing gear revealed that the right main landing gear actuator rod end was separated from the actuator ball joint. No other anomalies were noted. Further examination of the actuator rod and ball joint revealed that the ball joint was not centered or set in its normal position. In April 2013, after several other events involving similar landing gear malfunctions, the manufacturer issued two mandatory service bulletins (SB), which outlined protocols for inspecting the pistons and rods of the landing gear actuators, inspecting the ball joint centering of the landing gear actuators, and measuring the ball joint mismatches. In March 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive, which required compliance with the manufacturer\u2019s SBs and the repair or replacement of affected parts. ",

The flight instructor moved the trim wheel and noted no resistance. He then looked down at the wheel and observed the trim cable protruding from its side. The flight instructor assumed control of the airplane, advised the tower air traffic controller of the emergency, and landed the airplane without incident. Examination of the elevator trim cable assembly revealed that the trim cable failed due to fatigue cracking of the individual wires. The wire breaks were so numerous and over such a sizable length that they should have been detectable by a visual inspection. However, a review of the aircraft logbooks revealed that maintenance personnel did not detect the fatigue cracking of the wires during the most recent 100-hour and annual inspections nor during compliance with an airworthiness directive (AD) that required, in part, that all control cables be inspected for broken wires strands and that any broken wire strands be replaced; the inspections and AD were accomplished less than 2 months before the incident.",

The airplane's information manual contains several pages of limitations and warnings about departing with even small amounts of frost, ice, snow, or slush on the airplane, as it adversely affects the airplane's flight characteristics.

The crew also noted hydraulic and flight control annunciator messages and a gear unlocked indication. The flight remained in the traffic pattern and the airplane landed with a fuel imbalance of about 1,000 pounds. An examination of the airplane after the incident revealed minor damage in the left wing and gear well areas. The left main gear aft trunnion pivot pin was not in place, resulting in separation of the aft portion of the left main gear trunnion from the aft trunnion fitting. The end of the aft trunnion punctured the interior of the gear well, resulting in damage to surrounding structure and damage to the fuel cell and hydraulic line. The damage resulted in the fuel leak and the flight control and hydraulic messages. The pin was later found loose and undamaged in the flap track area of the left wing. The aft trunnion pivot pin retaining bolt that was intended to restrain the pivot pin was in place and secured with a nut and cotter pin. A review of maintenance records for the airplane revealed that the left main gear trunnion was removed and replaced with a new unit about six weeks before the incident. The maintenance was performed by an outside vendor. According to the airplane maintenance manual, when installing the aft main landing gear trunnion, the trunnion pivot pin must be slid forward, aligning a hole in the trunnion with a hole in the pivot pin. The trunnion pivot pin is then secured in place with the retaining bolt, washers, nut, and cotter pin.
