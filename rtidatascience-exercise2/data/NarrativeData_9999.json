Witnesses reported that, after takeoff, when the airplane was beyond the departure end of the runway and about 200 to 300 feet above the ground, the engine began sputtering and backfiring. The airplane then turned sharply to the right (back toward the runway), stalled, and spun. It began to recover, and, as it did, several witnesses heard a brief reestablishment of power before impact. An examination of the wreckage indicated that, at the time of impact, the airplane was in an approximate 20-degrees-nose-down left rotation. No preexisting mechanical anomalies were noted with the engine or the airplane. Both fuel tanks were found empty but compromised. Areas of browned vegetation at the crash site indicated that, although specific fuel amounts could not be determined, very little fuel had been in the left fuel tank and far more fuel had been in the right tank. Although the fuel selector was found in the right tank position, its position prior to the loss of engine power could not be determined. If the fuel selector had been selected to the right tank while the airplane was in its initial climb attitude, it is possible that there was an insufficient quantity of fuel in the tank to cover the port that supplied the engine and that, when the nose of the airplane subsequently fell during the stall, fuel moved forward to cover the port and resupply fuel to the engine, resulting in the restored power heard by witnesses. A more likely scenario is that the pilot took off with the fuel selected to the left tank, and, once the loss of engine power occurred, he selected the right tank, which resupplied fuel to the engine before impact. ",

As he got closer to the runway, he noted that he was right of centerline, and made corrections to return to the runway centerline for landing. The pilot indicated that he was still making corrections as he initiated the flare to land. The flare was too high, and as a result, the airplane developed a greater than desired sink rate, which he corrected by adding power.

The pilot flew the airplane to an offshore island that did not have fuel, deplaned passengers, and was returning to the mainland. The pilot planned for 4.6 hours of round trip operation and had previously flown similar flights to the same destination with durations of 4.6 to 5.1 hours. The outbound leg was completed without any anomalies noted; the pilot reported that the preflight inspection, start, taxi, runup and takeoff checks for the returning accident flight were \u201cnormal.\u201d Throughout the climb after takeoff, the pilot noted less manifold pressure on the left engine, and, by the time the airplane reached a cruising altitude of 10,500 feet, the engine was unable to maintain more than 55 percent power at 2,200 rpm and 26 inches of manifold pressure. The pilot matched the right engine power setting to the left and switched from the main fuel tanks to the outboard tanks at the top of the climb.He consulted the pilot operating handbook, which indicated a 4 gallon-per-hour reduction in fuel consumption at that power setting. En route, the left outboard tank emptied about 15 minutes before the right tank, which the pilot later reported was unusual because both engines normally burned evenly. About 60 nautical miles (nm) from the destination, the pilot initiated a descent, and about 55 nm from the destination, the left engine began surging. According to the pilot, the fuel gauges at the time indicated just below 1/4 full on the left main fuel tank and above 1/4 full on the right main fuel tank. The pilot turned on the emergency boost pump and selected fuel crossflow, which restored power to the left engine. The pilot then turned the airplane toward the nearest mainland airport, about 32 nm away, and contacted approach control. Shortly thereafter, the left engine surged, then lost power, followed closely by the right engine. The pilot turned on the emergency boost pumps, switched to the outboard and inboard fuel tanks sequentially (separately and with cross flow) but was unable to restore engine power. With the airplane descending through about 7,500 feet, the pilot completed the feathering procedure for both engines and established a best glide attitude, eventually landing the airplane on a beach.On-scene examination of the airplane did not reveal the presence of fuel, and no evidence of fuel leakage. The investigation did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation, and the pilot did not note any preexisting anomalies with the fuel quantity indicators. Insufficient and contradictory information precluded a determination as to why the airplane ran out of fuel. The pilot had previously flown the same route with ample fuel remaining, but couldn\u2019t for this flight. The left engine would not produce normal power, so the pilot reduced right engine power, which should have resulted in more en route flight time, but didn\u2019t. Lower power settings should have resulted in a longer time to destination, yet based on provided flight times, it didn\u2019t. The left outboard fuel tank ran out of fuel sooner than normal, indicating that either the left engine was utilizing an excessive amount of fuel, or the fuel tank had not been filled completely or fuel was drained from it at the intermediate stop. Also, when the left engine stopped the first time, the fuel gauge, which had not been previously been noted as inaccurate, reportedly still indicated the presence of fuel at just under 1/4 tank. \u00a0A direct line plot from the departure airport for the accident flight to the intended destination indicated the airplane overflew an island airport with fuel facilities about 105 nm from the destination and about 50 nm before the left engine began to surge. It is unknown if the pilot had sufficient information at that point to properly judge whether he should bypass an available en route fuel stop. However, with the information he did have, he judged that he had adequate fuel to complete his flight, which ultimately proved to be incorrect.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s in-flight misjudgment of fuel remaining resulting in fuel exhaustion and a total loss of engine power. Contributing to the accident was an inadequate fuel quantity for the flight for reasons that could not be determined during postaccident investigation."

The flt instructor (CFI) in the glider said the standard procedure for the tow plane was to depart with 10 deg of flaps & to turn left after takeoff. He said the tow pilot took off with 20 deg of flaps & made a right turn, then entered a steep turn to the left. Also, he said that during the steep turn, slack developed in the tow rope. The CFI tried to disconnect the tow rope, but was unable. The student said the rope became 'taught pulling up on the tow plane's tail.' The student then actuated the release; this time the rope released. The tow plane continued the left turn, nosed down, & struck the ground. The glider was landed uneventfully. Neither the tow plane nor the glider was equipped with a radio. Exam of the wreckage revealed no preimpact failure of the tow plane's flt controls or engine; 30 feet of tow rope was found attached to the tow plane, which had failed under tension. Two witnesses reported that the tow plt's hands always shook. One witness said his hands were shaking 'excessively' on the day of the accident. During toxicology tests, an undetermined amount of metoprolol was detected in the tow plt's blood & urine. Metoprolol is a medication that is frequently approved by the FAA for use by pilots with high blood pressure; drugs like metoprolol may also be used to treat a tremor. ",

The airport was situated in high desert terrain at an elevation of about 6,000 feet. About 1300, when the pilot had already completed 8 flights, and the other airplanes and pilots had also been actively flying, the pilot boarded three young passengers. According to the pilot, there were no clouds in the immediate vicinity, the wind was calm, and an automated weather broadcast for an airport about 17 miles to the northeast reported similar conditions. He started the airplane and taxied out for departure on runway 8. The airport windsock was \"motionless\" as he began the takeoff roll. A few hundred feet down the runway, while the airplane was still below liftoff speed, the left wing rose up, and the airplane weathervaned nose left about 60 degrees. The airplane exited the left (north) side of the runway, and then rotated about 120 degrees nose right before it came to rest. The right wing and fuselage sustained substantial damage, and the pilot and passengers were uninjured. About the same time, a flight instructor in an airplane on the downwind leg for runway 8 encountered \"turbulence,\" which resulted in a 500-foot altitude loss before she could stop the descent by \"climbing\" at her best angle-of-climb speed. Numerous persons at the airport for the event reported that a sudden, strong, and unexpected \"wind gust\" swept across the airport, and disturbed many objects on the ground, including some airplanes. They reported that it traveled approximately northwest to southeast, which meant that it approached the accident airplane from its left rear quarter. One pilot on the ground reported that there was a \"storm brewing\" near the mountains, about 6 miles northwest of the airport, at the time of the accident. According to Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 00-24 (Thunderstorms), \"Gust fronts often move far ahead (up to 15 miles) of associated precipitation. The gust front causes a rapid and sometimes drastic change in surface wind ahead of an approaching storm.\"",

At the time of the incident, COM26 was holding in takeoff position on runway 9L, and USA1251 was on approach to runway 9L.  USA1251 contacted the Fort Lauderdale (FLL) tower at 2342, and was cleared to land on runway 9L.  The local controller advised that there would be several departures before USA1251's arrival, and the pilot acknowledged.  At 2342:48, the controller cleared  a Southwest flight for takeoff and instructed Comair 716 (COM716) to taxi into position and hold, advising the pilot that there was arrival traffic on 9-mile final.  At 2343:52, the controller cleared COM716 for takeoff and instructed COM26 to taxi into position and hold on runway 9L, advising the pilot of COM26 that there was arrival traffic on 4-mile final.  At 2344:46, COM716 was instructed to contact departure control.  At 2344:52, the controller advised an arriving Gulfstream jet that they were number 2 for the runway, following a 737 on 2-mile final.  At 2345:15, the controller began a series of exchanges with a helicopter that was 38 miles from FLL and trying to contact Miami approach control.  At 2345:48, USA1251 asked if they were cleared to land; the controller responded, \"USA1251 cleared to land runway 9L.\"  Immediately, an unidentified voice on the frequency stated, \"Traffic on 9 left.\"  The controller transmitted, \"USAir go around, USAir go around, USAir 1251 go around.\"  USA1251 did go around, and, according to recorded radar data, passed about 100 feet above COM26.  After USA1251 was given back to Miami approach for resequencing, the flight returned and landed uneventfully. The LCN controller notified the tower supervisor of the incident as soon as it occurred, and she initiated a quality assurance review (QAR) that was logged in the Daily Record of Facility Operation.  According to the QAR summary, the supervisor interviewed both the local and ground controllers and reviewed the tape, concluding that there was no loss of separation between USA1251 and COM26 because USA1251 was instructed to go around when approximately one mile from the runway.  The pilot of COM26 filed a near midair collision report with FLL tower on the day after the incident. At the time of the incident, the Local Control North (LCN) controller was responsible for both the LCN and Local Control South (LCS) positions, and was therefore required to monitor operations on all runways. The tower is located between runways 9L and 9R, so the LCN controller was therefore required to divide his attention in opposite directions while handling aircraft on both of those runways.  Runway 9L is normally used for jet traffic, and runway 9R is normally used for general aviation traffic.  While USA1251 was on approach there were multiple departures and arrivals operating on runway 9L, and a Seneca waiting to depart on runway 9R.  Neither aircraft was damaged, and there were no reported injuries.  Weather conditions at FLL at 2253 UTC were reported as wind 060 at 12 knots, visibility 10 miles, with scattered clouds at 3,500 feet.",
            "probable_cause": "the local controller's failure to monitor the operation and recognize a developing traffic conflict which resulted in a loss of separation between USA1251 and ComAir 5026.  Contributing to the accident was the controller's incorrect prioritization of his workload."

At 1415, the observed wind, approximately 28 nautical miles south of the accident site, were 250 degrees at 6 knots.  The runway in use was runway 33.

The helicopter landed to the north on the front lawn of a private residence. After the patient was boarded, the commercial pilot attempted to determine the wind direction, but found no visual cues. However, he estimated the winds were about 10-15 knots from between 330 and 030 degrees. He stated that he had encountered similar winds while en route to the landing zone. A second EMS pilot who arrived at the scene after the accident stated that the winds were from 030 to 050 at 10 knots. The accident pilot stated that he brought the helicopter to a hover and maneuvered the helicopter to the right to avoid power lines that crossed the residential property. The pilot stated that when he departed, he began a vertical ascent but was trying not to increase the collective above the available torque. He stated that he was concerned about clearing the power lines and losing tail rotor effectiveness. When the helicopter reached an altitude abeam of the power lines, it began an uninitiated spin to the right. The pilot stated that the torque was near 100 percent. He applied full left torque pedal, and attempted to gain forward airspeed. He also used the cyclic to follow the nose of the aircraft in an attempt to fly out of the turn. The pilot was unable to gain airspeed and the helicopter continued to spin to the right and to descend. The pilot initiated an autorotation by lowering the collective and placing the throttle in the idle position, which he stated stopped the spinning. When the helicopter was about 10 to 20 feet above ground, the pilot placed the collective in the full-up position to cushion the landing. However, there was not sufficient main rotor rpm to stop the high rate of descent and the helicopter landed hard in a field adjacent to the private residence.

Pilot and mechanic witnesses on the airport described the engine sounds during the takeoff as abnormal.  The takeoff ground roll was over 3,000 feet in length, and the airplane's climb out angle was much shallower than usual.  Two other witnesses said the engine sounded \"like a radial engine,\" and both believed that the power output was lower than normal.  One mechanic witness said the engine was surging and not developing full power; he believed the symptoms could be associated with a fuel feed problem, a turbocharger surge, or an excessively lean running condition.  The ground witnesses located near the impact site said the airplane began a steep left turn between 1/4- and 1/2-mile from the runway's end at a lower than normal altitude.  The bank angle was estimated by the witnesses as 45 degrees or greater.  The turn continued until the nose suddenly dropped and the airplane entered a spiraling descent to ground impact.  The majority of these witnesses stated that they heard \"sputtering\" or \"popping\" noises coming from the airplane. Engineering personnel from the manufacturer developed a performance profile for a normal takeoff and climb under the ambient conditions of the accident and at gross weight. The profile was compared to the actual aircraft performance derived from recorded radar data and the witness observations.  The ground roll was 1,300 feet longer than it should have been, and the speed/acceleration and climb performance were consistently well below the profile's predictions.  Based on the radar data and factoring in the winds, the airplane's estimated indicated airspeed during the final turn was 82 knots; the stall speed at 45 degrees of bank is 82 knots and it increases linearly to 96 knots at 60 degrees of bank.  No evidence was found that the pilot flew the airplane from December until the date of the accident.  The airplane sat outside during the rainy season with only 10 gallons of fuel in each tank.  Comparison of the time the fueling began and the communications transcripts disclosed that the pilot had 17 minutes 41 seconds to refuel the airplane with 120 gallons, reboard the airplane, and start the engine for taxi; the maximum nozzle discharge flow rate of the pump he used is 24 gallons per minute.  Review of the communications transcripts found that a time interval of 3 minutes 35 seconds elapsed from the time the pilot asked for a taxi clearance from the fuel facility until he reported ready for takeoff following a taxi distance of at least 2,000 feet.  During the 8 seconds following the pilot's acknowledgment of his takeoff clearance, he and the local controller carried on a nonpertinent personal exchange.  The aircraft was almost completely consumed in the postcrash fire; however, extensive investigation of the remains failed to identify a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure in the engine or airframe systems.  The pistons, cylinder interiors, and spark plugs from all six cylinders were clean without combustion deposits.  The cockpit fuel selector lever, the intermediate linkages, and the valve itself were found in the OFF position; however, an engineering analysis established that insufficient fuel was available in the lines forward of the selector to start, taxi, and perform a takeoff with the selector in the OFF position.

Factors in the accident include the pilot's failure to detect the power deficiency early in the takeoff roll due to his diverted attention by a nonpertinent personal conversation with the local controller, and, the lack of suitable forced landing sites in the takeoff flight path.

He drained about 6 ounces of fuel from the fuel strainer, and found 'no visible contaminants.'  The fuel vent next to the pitot tube 'appeared to be open.'  The pilot started the airplane, taxied it to the runway, and performed an engine run-up.  He then back-taxied down the runway, then took off.  After takeoff, about 125 feet agl, the engine lost all power, and the pilot made a forced landing.  Several hours later, the left wing drain was still frozen, but there was fuel coming out of the wing vent.  The pilot thought the sun had warmed the vent, which then melted ice inside, and allowed the fuel to leak out of the tank.  The following morning, the pilot drained over 10 gallons of fuel into containers 'with no hesitation or water.'

Finding no apparent damage, the helicopter was started, ground run, and then hovered. While hovering, a tail rotor driveshaft coupling separated, and the pilot did a hovering autorotation back to the snow-covered ice field. As a result of the tail rotor driveshaft coupling separation, the helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tail rotor drive shaft assembly. The damage to the tail rotor drive shaft occurred as the helicopter was being ferried from the site, not during the original event. Most likely the drive shaft was degraded during the first landing, but it did not separate until the ferry flight.",

The recently overhauled engine had just been installed the morning of the accident in the airframe and this was the first flight following this maintenance activity.  The mechanic who installed the engine said after he completed the reinstallation he performed a 20-minute ground run of the engine.  A fuel leak was noted in a fitting in the line to the carburetor and that was tightened.  There were no other discrepancies noted in the engine indications.  The pilot arrived at the airport after the mechanic had performed the ground run of the engine.  He said the mechanic told him that the airplane was ready for a test flight and that he should take it up for about an hour to break-in the engine, changing the rpm setting every 5 minutes.  The pilot said he did a preflight inspection, which included the determination that he had 6 gallons in each of the wing tanks and 6 gallons in the header tank, for a total of about 18 gallons.  After the preflight, he started the engine and taxied down to the runway where he did his normal run-up process, which included two separate magneto checks.  After takeoff he flew out about 3 miles and orbited while varying the rpm every 5 minutes.  During the entire flight from engine start, the power plant performed perfectly with no abnormal engine indications.  At the end of 1 hour, he reported to the control tower that he was ready to land and turned inbound toward the runway.  On final approach, the engine just quit without any precipitating roughness or engine spool down.  He said it was \"like someone just turned off the key.\"  He did not have enough altitude to make the runway and the airplane hit a fence and landed inverted on the highway.   Post accident examination of the engine and related systems found numerous discrepancies and abnormal conditions related to the engine overhaul and its reinstallation in the airframe.  While many of these discrepancies would have eventually induced a catistrophic engine failure, they were not contributory to the loss of engine power.  Three specific conditions were likely related to the engine power loss.  The engine driven fuel pump's outlet fitting was found loose and was easily moved, and the nuts attaching the fuel pump to the crankcase were found to be only finger tight.  The nuts securing the P-leads for both magnetos were loose, with the nuts 2-turns from finger tight.  The scuffing on the pistons indicates that the overhaul shop did not pre-oil the pistons, rings, and cylinders when the engine was put back together; this dry condition allowed a large quantity of oil to migrate past the rings, fouling the plugs with carbon deposits.  The fuel system in the aircraft consists of a 6-gallon tank in each wing and a 6-gallon header tank, which is mounted in front of the cockpit.  Fuel is supplied to the engine's carburetor via gravity fed line only from the header tank.  The engine driven fuel pump moves fuel from the wing tanks to the header tank to replenish that supply as the engine uses it.   According to the Teledyne Continental operating manual for the \"C\" series engines, the typical cruise fuel consumption rate of the C75 engine is between 5 and 6 gallons per hour.   At the conclusion of the impact sequence, the aircraft came to rest inverted, with all three fuel tanks breched.  A fuel spill was noted  under the fuel tank locations in both wings, and based on the size of the fuel stain, investigators estimated at least 10 gallons had leaked.  The loose fitting on the fuel pump likely allowed it to suck air and resulted in inefficeincey to the extent that the header tank was depleted of fuel, which in turn resulted in a fuel starvation event.  The mechanic was going to leave town immediately after completing this job for a planned multi week vacation trip.",
            "probable_cause": "fuel starvation due to the mechanic's failure to properly tighten a fuel line fitting on the engine driven fuel pump, which led to a depletion of the fuel in the header tank.  The mechanic's self induced pressure to complete the job prior to leaving on vacation was a factor in the accident."

The force of the case rupture caused the hinge-mounted core cowl halves to distort and strike the leading edge and underside of the airplane's left wing, resulting in minor airplane damage. Metallurgical investigation and review of the engine's maintenance records determined that cracks in the engine's diffuser case rear flange (M-flange) and cracks in the HPT case forward flange (M-flange) were not detected when the cases underwent fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) during the engine's last shop visit, 3,479 cycles before the event. The undetected cracks continued to  propagate, leading to the in-service diffuser case rupture. The reason for the ineffective inspection was not determined, but was narrowed to chronological- and operator-based scenarios. A suspect population of 50 engines was identified that included sub-populations for both possibilities. The FAA published airworthiness directive (AD) 2014-05-32, requiring the M-flanges of PW2037, PW2037D, PW2037M, PW2040, PW2040D, PW2043, PW2143, PW2240, PW2337, PW2643, and F117-PW-100 engines in the identified suspect population to undergo eddy current inspection within 100 flight cycles or 30 days.

The airplane initially had a positive rate of climb, but then immediately yawed to the left as it cleared 30-foot-high power lines that were perpendicular across the flight path. The airport is at the east end of a lake in a mountain valley; the airplane departed to the west and was flying over the lake. The airplane was about 2 miles from the runway when witnesses observed dark smoke coming from the left engine, and the smoke increased significantly as the flight continued. The airplane banked hard left with the wings perpendicular to the ground, and then nosed in vertically. The landing gear remained down throughout the accident sequence. On site examination revealed that the top spark plugs for the left engine were black and sooty. A detailed examination revealed that the left turbocharger turbine wheel shaft fractured and separated. Extreme oxidation of the fracture surfaces prevented identification of the failure mode; however, the oxidation was the result of high temperature exposure indicating that the fracture occurred while the turbocharger was at elevated temperature during operation. The multiple planes exhibited by the fracture also were not consistent with a ductile torsional failure as would be expected from a sudden stoppage of either rotor.  No evidence of a mechanical malfunction was noted to the right engine. The Cessna Owners Manual for the airplane notes that the most critical time for an engine failure is a 2-3 second period late in the takeoff while the airplane is accelerating from the minimum single-engine control speed of 87 KIAS to a safe single-engine speed of 106 KIAS. Although the airplane is controllable at the minimum control speed, the airplane's performance is so far below optimum that continued flight near the ground is improbable. Once 106 KIAS is achieved, altitude can more easily be maintained while the pilot retracts the landing gear and feathers the propeller. The best single-engine rate-of-climb is 108 KIAS with flaps up below 18,000 feet msl.  Section VI of the manual provides operational data for single-engine climb capability. The data was only valid for the following conditions: gear and flaps retracted, inoperative propeller feathered, wing banked 5 degrees toward the operating engine, 39.5 inches of manifold pressure if below 18,000 feet, and mixture at recommended fuel flow.",

On base leg, he switched to the right tank.  After turning final, he initiated a go-around due to conflicting traffic.  The engine sputtered and lost power on the go-around.  There was insufficient altitude to reach a suitable landing area, and the airplane settled into the trees in a nose down attitude.  The fuel selector was turned off as the airplane began hitting the trees.  Examination revealed the left fuel tank was empty, and when the cap on the right fuel tank was loosened, fuel gushed out around the edges of the cap.  When the fuel selector was positioned to the right tank, fuel flowed from the right tank to the sump, which was broken, and the odor of fuel was detected in the air.  The airplane had operated for 1 hour, 43 minutes on a fuel tank with a listed capacity of 12.5 gallons. ",
