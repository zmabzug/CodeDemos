The prior flight was flown from Chino, California, to Sacramento, California, and back to Chino without refueling after landing.  The fuel computer/totalizer indicated that 58 gallons were left onboard following the trip.  On the accident flight, the pilot leaned the mixture and engaged the autopilot after leveling out.  A short time later, the engine began surging.  The pilot enriched the mixture and turned the fuel boost on low, and the engine lost total power.  He went through the emergency checklist, maintaining boost pump on and switching through the fuel tanks.  After realizing he could not make the airport, he decided to land on a road and hit a truck. Examination of the wreckage revealed no fuel leaks were found in the lines or tanks.  During disassembly, no fuel was found in the right main tank.  Six gallons were in the left main tank; 7 gallons were in the left tip tank, and 2 gallons were in the right tip tank.  The fuel selector was positioned to the left tip tank.  A wet smear caked with dirt was present on the left tip tank from the filler port aft along the outboard side toward the trailing edge tip.  The stopper type filler caps for the tip tanks were found loose in the filler ports.  Also, the rubber stoppers were found to be cracked and deteriorated.  The continuity of the fuel system was established.  The aircraft master switch was energized and the sending unit floats were manipulated by hand and found that the gauges read high.  The engine was restarted with the aid of serviceable propeller and fuel.  The engine accelerated normally to 1,700 rpm where a magneto check was performed, and with a 60-rpm drop for both magnetos. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper management of his fuel supply which resulted in fuel starvation.  Factors in the accident were the inadequate annual inspection which resulted in fuel siphoning, and a high reading fuel gage. "

The flight crew executed a go-around about 360 feet above ground level.  Despite continued difficulties with the rudder, the flight crew was able to land the airplane successfully.  Examination of the autopilot yaw actuator revealed two main findings:  (1) the wiring to the two main valve solenoids had been cross connected, and (2) a foreign-particle contaminant in the green system engagement valve solenoid had prevented disengagement of the yaw actuator.  Investigators found that when these two conditions exist, turn coordination system inputs can cause uncommanded rudder movements.  Inspections of A300 and A310 airplanes after the incident resulted in the discovery of another American A300 with cross-connected solenoid wiring.  American indicated that it had installed new autopilot actuator solenoids on this airplane and the rest of its A300 fleet.  At the time the solenoids were installed, American's procedures did not include a check for proper installation of the solenoid wiring.  The manufacturers of the airplane and the actuator have since incorporated new procedures to ensure that the solenoids are wired properly.  As part of the investigation, numerous additional solenoids were examined for the presence of contaminants.  Although contaminants were discovered on several other solenoids, they were smaller than that found on the incident airplane's engagement solenoid and did not affect solenoid functionality.  Audits of the solenoid assembly process revealed the need to update production and inspection documentation and the need to include measures to prevent foreign particles from contaminating adjacent workstations.  The manufacturer of the solenoids took corrective actions that included improving production facilities, implementing more stringent sampling and inspection procedures, and clarifying assembly instructions.",

The pilot then departed on a dark night.  According to a performance study of radar data, the airplane proceeded over land at 5,500 feet.  About 34 miles west of Martha's Vineyard Airport, while crossing a 30-mile stretch of water to its destination, the airplane began a descent that varied between 400 to 800 feet per minute (fpm).  About 7 miles from the approaching shore, the airplane began a right turn.  The airplane stopped its descent at 2,200 feet, then climbed back to 2,600 feet and entered a left turn.  While in the left turn, the airplane began another descent that reached about 900 fpm.  While still in the descent, the airplane entered a right turn.  During this turn, the airplane's rate of descent and airspeed increased.  The airplane's rate of descent eventually exceeded 4,700 fpm, and the airplane struck the water in a nose-down attitude.  Airports along the coast reported visibilities between 5 and 8 miles.  Other pilots flying similar routes on the night of the accident reported no visual horizon while flying over the water because of haze.  The pilot's estimated total flight experience was about 310 hours, of which 55 hours were at night.  The pilot's estimated flight time in the accident airplane was about 36 hours, of which about 9.4 hours were at night.  About 3 hours of that time was without a certified flight instructor (CFI) on board, and about 0.8 hour of that was flown at night and included a night landing.  In the 15 months before the accident, the pilot had flown either to or from the destination area about 35 times.  The pilot flew at least 17 of these flight legs without a CFI on board, of which 5 were at night.  Within 100 days before the accident, the pilot had completed about 50 percent of a formal instrument training course.  A Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular (AC) 61-27C, \"Instrument Flying:  Coping with Illusions in Flight,\" states that illusions or false impressions occur when information provided by sensory organs is misinterpreted or inadequate and that many illusions in flight could be caused by complex motions and certain visual scenes encountered under adverse weather conditions and at night.  The AC also states that some illusions might lead to spatial disorientation or the inability to determine accurately the attitude or motion of the aircraft in relation to the earth's surface.  The AC further states that spatial disorientation, as a result of continued VFR flight into adverse weather conditions, is regularly near the top of the cause/factor list in annual statistics on fatal aircraft accidents.  According to AC 60-4A, \"Pilot's Spatial Disorientation,\" tests conducted with qualified instrument pilots indicated that it can take as long as 35 seconds to establish full control by instruments after a loss of visual reference of the earth's surface.  AC 60-4A further states that surface references and the natural horizon may become obscured even though visibility may be above VFR minimums and that an inability to perceive the natural horizon or surface references is common during flights over water, at night, in sparsely populated areas, and in low-visibility conditions.

As he entered the downwind leg of the approach, the engine lost all power. Unable to restart the engine, the pilot performed a forced landing into an adjacent field, where the airplane sustained substantial damage.A wasp was found in the carburetor fuel bowl, and a wasp head was located wedged within the inner sleeve of the carburetor metering valve. The head was adjacent to the fuel channel hole, blockage of which would have resulted in a loss of fuel flow to the engine and subsequent loss of engine power. Both fuel tank vent ports were also found completely blocked with mud that was likely deposited by the wasp. However, the blocked fuel tank vent ports were unlikely to cause fuel starvation because fuel was present in all the supply lines and the fuel tanks were equipped with venting fuel caps, which were operational.The only path for a wasp-sized insect to access the carburetor fuel bowl was via the atmospheric bowl vent, the opening of which was located at the carburetor's air inlet. The vent leads directly to the fuel bowl and is wide enough for a wasp to pass through. The wasp most likely accessed the vent through either a hole in the air induction system, a gap in the carburetor-heat door seal, or through the carburetor-heat door opening (assuming the door had not been fully closed on the ground).It is not known when the wasp entered the fuel system. The airplane\u2019s last annual inspection was performed about 2 1/2 years prior to the accident; however, it is unlikely the wasp would have been discovered during an annual inspection because the carburetor is not an inspection item. The insect would also be difficult to detect during preflight inspection.",

At that point, he decided to return to the local airstrip. The pilot stated: \"Approximately 1/2 mile away I slowed down and added 20 degrees of flaps.  As I approached the threshold end at a heading of 090 degrees, I applied more flaps.  The airplane stayed in ground [effect] and didn't land until about 2/3 of the way down the runway.  Upon touchdown I took out all flaps as the airplane slid down the grass/muddy runway.  The airplane slid off the end of the runway with the nose wheel striking a gravel road and breaking off.  The airplane then flipped over coming to rest upside down in the road ditch.\"  The pilot reported that he decided to approach straight-in, for a downwind landing, due to the lack of available power, as well as the rising terrain and two sets of power lines east of the airstrip.  He noted that he was slightly fast on final approach.  According to the pilot, his preflight weather briefing advised of winds from 240 degrees at 14 knots.  Winds reported 20nm north of the accident site were from 330 degrees at 17 knots.  During a post accident examination, no compression was obtained on engine cylinder 2.  The number 2 cylinder was removed and the cylinder and piston were inspected.  The bottom edge of the number 2 piston head was eroded and burned.  The damage extended past the piston rings and included a hole in the side of the piston.  In addition, the side of the piston as well as the cylinder wall, exhibited scoring in the direction of piston travel. The piston rings were broken.  The condition of the piston was consistent with pre-ignition.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power due to the erosion of the number 2 piston, resulting in loss of compression on that cylinder.  Contributing factors were the tailwind, the muddy runway condition, and the roadway and ditch."

The pilot requested to climb to 10,000 feet and was cleared to do so. Shortly thereafter, the pilot reported that he was level at 10,000 feet. Approximately 33 minutes later, air traffic control (ATC) radioed the pilot with a frequency change; however, the pilot did not respond. Repeated attempts to contact the pilot were unsuccessful as the airplane continued flying a straight course, while at 10,000 feet, towards its intended destination. One hour and 33 minutes after the last pilot contact, the autopilot equipped airplane made a rapid descending right turn before radar contact was lost. In the area of the last radar contact, several fishermen reported observing the accident airplane descending nose down and impacting the surface of a reservoir. The airplane's wreckage came to rest about 40 feet below the surface of the water. Calculations revealed that if the pilot maintained full throttle and did not switch fuel tanks during the flight, the selected fuel tank would have been nearly empty by the time it reached the area near the crash site; thus a loss of engine power could have occurred. Multiple dives were conducted in an attempt to recover the wreckage. The ballistic parachute was found in its storage bag and had not been deployed. The fiberglass fuselage and wings were not located. In addition, the avionics equipment with nonvolatile memory, that would have recorded the accident flight, was not located. Maintenance records revealed that in the previous year and a half, the airplane\u2019s number six exhaust header was found to be cracked and was replaced three separate times; however, the exhaust system was not recovered and therefore could not be examined to see if possible carbon monoxide leaks were present. The airplane was not equipped with a factory installed carbon monoxide detector, and investigators were unable to determine if an aftermarket unit was installed. Due to the limited remains that were recovered, an autopsy could not be accomplished on the pilot or passengers. In addition, adequate specimens were not recovered to perform toxological testing for the presence of carbon monoxide or cyanide. No reported radio communications with the airplane for the hour prior to the accident, straight and level flight consistent with flying with an autopilot with no deviations, estimated fuel calculations indicating that the airplane could have exhausted all its fuel by the time it reached the accident location, a repeated history of exhaust leaks, no evidence of an on-board carbon monoxide detector, and radar showing the airplane in an unarrested descent prior to impact, suggest that the pilot and passengers may have been incapacitated during the last portion of the flight.

After starting the engine, he performed a pedal turn to the right, and brought the helicopter to a 4 foot hover with all engine indications in the green. He commenced a southeasterly takeoff profile into the 10-15 knot wind while maintaining a steadily climb at 30 to 40 knots. When the flight was at approximately 20 foot, the helicopter yawed to the right \"sharply.\" He stopped the climb and was able to correct back to the original heading with left anti-torque pedal input. When the helicopter attained the original heading, it started spinning to the right \"uncontrollably.\"  He then entered an autorotation into the water where he and the passenger evacuated the helicopter before it sank approximately 60 yards from the dock. The pilot stated he maintained a southerly heading from the point of hovering to the autorotation and he did not contact any object during the entire flight. Examination of the tail rotor conducted by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the tailrotor drive shaft was fractured approximately six inches aft of the tailrotor drive shaft damper assembly. NTSB review of pictures provided by FAA revealed both ends of the fracture surfaces of the tailrotor drive shaft exhibited evidence of torsional twisting. The tailrotor blades were found to be fractured approximately 8 inches from the center of rotation. The FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21) states that unanticipated yaw, also referred to as loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), may occur in all single-rotor helicopters at airspeeds less than 30 knots, and occurs to the right in helicopters with a counter-clockwise rotating main rotor (Robinson 22). It is the result of the tail rotor not providing adequate thrust to maintain directional control. The suggested recovery technique of a sudden unanticipated right yaw is to apply full left pedal while simultaneously moving cyclic control forward to increase speed. As recovery is effected, adjust controls for normal forward flight. Collective pitch reduction aids in arresting the yaw rate but may cause an excessive rate of descent. Any large, rapid increase in collective to prevent ground or obstacle contact may further increase the yaw rate and decrease rotor revolution per minute (RPM). NTSB review of the Robinson R22 Beta Pilot's Operating Handbook revealed that the recommended takeoff profile, from a hover, is to maintain 5 feet until reaching 40 knots. This is where a steady climb may be commenced while accelerating to 60 knots.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot-in-command to comply with performance data related to the recommended takeoff profile and his failure to perform remedial action following reduced tailrotor effectiveness, resulting in subsequent initiation of an autorotation and ditching."

The airplane was owned by Air USA Inc., and operated as a public use flight in support of the United Stated Air Force (USAF). The airline transport pilot and pilot rated passenger were not injured. The driver of the truck sustained fatal injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence. The local area flight departed Yuma at 1148. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a Military visual flight rules flight plan had been filed.The airplane was being utilized along with a second similarly equipped Hawk (callsign BADGER2) by the USAF as part of the Special Operation Terminal Attack Controller Course (SOTACC). Their mission was to provide close air support for the training of Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC's). The airplane was equipped with external fuel tanks on each wing, along with a series of practice ordinances attached to two wing-mounted bomb dispensers.At the time of the accident, a construction crew was preparing a concrete pad at the left edge of Runway 03L in preparation for the installation of an expeditionary arresting gear system. The pad was located 10 feet from the runway edge, about 6,500 feet from the Runway 03L landing threshold. The construction operation, which included support vehicles, crew, and construction equipment, occupied the space from the runway pad outwards about 150 feet. The truck that was struck was located 140 feet from the runway edge, and was occupied by a Marine Lance Corporal who was providing operational escort and safety support for the construction crew.The pilot reported that the preflight, engine start, taxi, and line-up on Runway 03L were uneventful. The airplane was positioned on the right side of the runway, with BADGER2, positioned as the wingman to the left and aft, on a 15 second departure delay. The pilot stated that once cleared for takeoff, he applied engine thrust and the engine run-up, take-off roll, and acceleration check speeds were as expected. He felt the airplane's nose wheel become light about the time they reached rotation speed. The nose of the airplane then lifted, and a short time later the main wheels became airborne. The left wing then dropped, and the nose yawed about 10 degrees to the left. He applied corrective control inputs, but the airplane did not respond as he expected, and they continued to drift to the left. The airplane continued to bank left and then right, at an altitude of between 5 and 15 feet above ground level, and the main landing gear touched the runway and then the adjoining shoulder multiple times during the recovery attempt. The airplane was now flying directly over the shoulder, about 100 feet left of the runway edge, when a short time later, its right wing struck the truck. The airplane yawed to the right, coming to rest on the shoulder, about 650 feet beyond the point of impact. The truck came to rest about 160 feet beyond the point of impact.The airplane's fuselage separated from the wing center section during the accident sequence, and was partially consumed by fire.

The helicopter was in a climb at 95 knots indicated airspeed and the pilot had just applied power when he and his passenger noticed a moderate to severe vibration which lasted a few seconds. The pilot reduced power and it went away. The pilot then reduced power to around 55 psi torque at about 90 knots indicated airspeed and trimmed forward to do a reverse trim check while trying to maintain torque and altitude with slightly heavy collective.

The controller then turned his attention to other air traffic, and about 1 minute later again advised the Piper pilot of the traffic at 2,200 feet. Immediately after the transmission, a mid-air collision occurred between the two airplanes. Radar data revealed that between the two callouts by the controller, the Cessna had altered its course from a general heading of 220 degrees magnetic to a heading of 177 degrees magnetic. Sun position, about the time of the accident, was 27 degrees above the horizon, bearing about 227 degrees; however, the extent to which the sun factored in the Cessna student pilot's ability to see the Piper is unknown.

While in the hover, the pilot allowed the aircraft to move a short distance back and to the side. This put it into a position where its main rotor blades came in contact with a coniferous tree. Although the ground crew transmitted a warning to the pilot to power up and out of the trees, the rotor blades began coming apart before the pilot was able to take corrective action.

While turning to the base leg from about 735 feet above the runway elevation, the pilot lost visual reference to the horizon due to a frontal air mass about 20 miles northwest of the airport, and he had no visual reference to the ground because he was flying over an unpopulated river bottom. After leveling the airplane on the base leg, the pilot suddenly saw a treetop to the left of the airplane and immediately added full power and initiated a climb, but he was unable to avoid striking trees. The pilot was able to maintain control of the airplane and land safely. The pilot said that he did not feel any wind gusts but thought that he encountered some sort of \u201cdowndraft\u201d that resulted in a rapid loss of altitude with no gain in airspeed.A weather study conducted by an NTSB meteorologist revealed that conditions were favorable for the formation of a weather phenomenon known as a mesoscale gravity wave. These waves can result in rapid wind changes and areas of increased windshear and turbulence. The study determined that the wave likely originated from a strong downdraft or microburst from a large thunderstorm complex in central and northeastern Texas then propagated eastward toward the accident site. At the time and place of the accident, the wave dramatically reduced the southerly wind component above the low-level inversion; therefore, it is likely that, as the pilot descended, he inadvertently encountered a sudden wind shift or rapid decrease in the speed of the southerly wind component that resulted in a rapid loss of altitude. A review of available weather information revealed that the mesoscale gravity wave was not forecasted; however, such waves are rare and difficult to forecast.  A research study suggests that there is a \u201cpoor understanding of gravity waves\u201d and that \u201cacknowledged skepticism of their existence stems from the fact that it is both difficult and tedious to conduct a study of even a single event.\u201d The study further notes that \u201cforecasters have often been misled by the existence of large scale gravity waves.\u201d",

There were no reported radio communications or distress calls.  During post accident component examinations, while performing the rigging procedure for the Hydro-Mechanical Unit (HMU) during an engine test cell run, anomalies were noted with the actual position of the throttle Position Lever Angle (PLA) and the readings obtained from the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).  During the test cell run, the Full Authority Digital Electronic Control System (FADEC) controlled engine operated erratically in the Auto mode when rigged with its original Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and (HMU).  The engine control was then changed from Auto to Manual mode, and the engine responded to throttle input as required; however, the ECU readings were erratic.  After a slave ECU was installed, the engine operated with similar erratic readings.  A slave HMU was installed, and the engine operated normally without erratic readings.  The ECU's nonvolatile memory was downloaded, and revealed no faults on the accident flight.  Extensive electrical and mechanical testing of the HMU revealed severe signal fallout on the PLA signal, which was found to be random in location, bi-directional, and present during both rotational and stationary operation of the PLA input of the HMU.  The source of the fallout was traced to the HMU potentiometer.  The PLA potentiometer examinations consisted of mechanical measurements, electrical testing, inspection of the conductive epoxy joints, and microscopic examination of the three lead wire connections to the potentiometer elements.  The PLA potentiometer was found faulty due to insulation breakdown between the rotor and shaft, resulting in a single-point failure that induced erratic fuel metering to the engine.  As a result of the findings from this investigation, the Safety Board issued four safety recommendations (A-03-18 through A-03-21), on May 27, 2003, to the FAA that addressed the PLA potentiometer deficiencies.",

The aircraft passed through the tops of trees approximately 150 feet beyond, and entered a stall/spin maneuver, impacting a power line and the ground approximately 2,800 feet short of the runway threshold. The flaps and landing gear were in a retracted position. Post-crash examination revealed the crankshaft separated in fatigue which originated from a circumferential gouge mark on the aft face of the #2 cheek at an area located outboard of the forward radius of the #1 rod journal. The circumferential gouge mark on the crankcheek was consistent with the connecting rod shifting forward during engine operation. The rub marks on the cheek walls of the #1 connecting rod were consistent with tight piston pin bushing to piston pin clearance. Additionally, the bushings for all the connecting rods were undersize. Airframe/engine logs revealed a top overhaul of the engine approximately 23 hours prior to the crankshaft failure, during which the piston pins were replaced but the connecting rod bushings were not. No dimensional check of the bushings was made or required at that time. The engine was overhauled 515 hours previous to the top overhaul. The manufacturer's overhaul manual specifies that the new bushings should be reamed to the specified (inside) diameter. Post-crash examination of the engine revealed non-standard connecting rod cotter keys and light fretting between the engine case halves. ",

As the pilot approached his destination, which was surrounded by high terrain, the scattered cloud layer below him became broken and light conditions were dimming as the sun set. After seeing a break in the clouds and being uncomfortable with what he observed, the pilot requested the GPS-A approach then maneuvered to intercept the inbound course at the initial approach fix (IAF). Before reaching the IAF, he saw a clear visual path to his destination. At the same time, the air traffic controller was awaiting cancellation from a landing aircraft and advised that the pilot should expect an instruction to hold. The pilot advised that visual meteorological conditions existed and that he would continue visually. He then turned, descended, and crossed the final approach course inside of the final approach fix. The controller then received the cancellation he had been waiting for and cleared the pilot for the GPS-A approach. The pilot acknowledged and continued his descent. The controller then asked the pilot to cancel his IFR clearance with him or on the ground. The pilot replied with his intention to fly a visual flight rules (VFR) approach and canceled the IFR clearance. The pilot had the town in sight and estimated there was a 2,000-foot ceiling. Light conditions were significantly darker below the cloud layer. He switched to the Unicom frequency and keyed the microphone five times to activate the runway lights but did not see them. He tried twice more, and the lights still did not activate. As the pilot considered whether to climb or circle the airport and try the lights again, he maintained his last heading, which he believed would keep him over lower terrain. However, the airplane drifted right of course. The pilot had decided to climb when a passenger then observed trees. The pilot pulled up to avoid them, but the airplane struck trees and terrain, sustaining substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage. Radar data revealed that the pilot had never become established on the approach, at no point was in position to land, and was never closer than 1 mile northeast of the airport before flying into rising terrain. No anomalies with airport lighting were discovered. Examination of the GPS-A approach procedure revealed that it was not authorized for use at night.

He executed a forced landing in a water-filled rice paddy adjacent to the airstrip. After touchdown, the airplane nosed over onto its back. The non-U.S. designed airplane was originally manufactured and delivered with a reciprocating engine. About 18 years before the accident, that engine was replaced with a U.S. military turboshaft engine via a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) field approval. About 15 years after the engine change, and 3 years before the accident, the FAA mandated that piston-to-turbine engine conversions required the use of either an amended Type Certificate or a Supplemental Type Certificate, and that field approvals were no longer appropriate. Detailed examination of the engine revealed that most of the power turbine blades were severely damaged or missing. Material analysis of the turbine components revealed that the first stage turbine blades failed due to short-term exposure to excessively high temperatures and that other turbine blades failed due to impact damage from the thermally-failed first stage blades. The combustor was equipped with multiple fuel vaporizers, nearly all of which exhibited significant long-term thermal damage. None of the vaporizers were within the operable damage limits specified by the maintenance guidance. The damaged fuel vaporizers altered the combustor exit temperature profiles, which precipitated the first stage turbine blade failures. Maintenance records indicated that the 600-hour inspection interval of the engine hot section had been exceeded at least twice in the 14 years preceding the accident, and that, at the time of the accident, the engine had exceeded the hot section overhaul interval by about 300 hours. In-service records for the failed components could not be located. Although they did not contribute to the accident, multiple irregularities with the airplane's maintenance documentation were discovered during the investigation.",

The airplane was on a positioning flight following a right engine change because of a previous engine failure, which had occurred about 1 month prior to the accident.  The airplane had remained parked on the ramp at the airport without security. The operator said that they usually provided security for airplanes parked in remote locations due to past incidents of vandalism and fuel theft, but did not do so on this occasion.  The pilot of the accident airplane did not visually check the fuel quantity; instead, he relied on the fuel gauges.  He did not open the cowling on either engine but relied on the mechanic's word that the aircraft was ready for flight.  After takeoff, when he changed the left fuel selector from the main to the auxiliary tank, the engine quit.  He turned toward the runway, switched the fuel selector back to the main tank, and turned the left fuel boost pump switch to high.  The left engine fuel flow was near zero and there was no effect with the boost pump.  He then noticed that the right engine was losing power.  He did not feather either propeller.

The castellated nuts that secured the flex coupling to the aft flange of the shaft were found loose, and the bolts were sheared. An examination of the bolts and flex coupling determined that the nuts were most likely hand-tightened and that cotter pins were not installed on three attachment bolts between the flex coupling and flange portion of the drive shaft.A review of the maintenance records revealed that, about 75 flight hours before the accident, the engine had been removed so that maintenance personnel could perform a modification.

The engine subsequently experienced a total loss of power. The pilot maneuvered the airplane to a pasture where the airplane collided with a fence during the landing roll.  According to the engine logbooks, the last engine annual inspection had been performed about 6 months and 124 hours prior to the accident.  The left magneto had been replaced about 3 months and 54 hours prior to the accident. A teardown inspection of the engine disclosed that the left idler gear was damaged with several teeth missing and one tooth wedged between the forward face of the gear and crankcase. A detailed metallurgical examination of the left idler gear revealed that it failed due to fatigue. Fatigue features were observed at two locations, and both had initiated in the radius between a gear tooth flank and the root. The gears that were engaged with the idler gear were intact and mostly undamaged. The fracture surface at one fatigue location on the left idler gear was much more reflective than the other. A reflective surface, indicative of a rubbing motion of one fracture surface against another, indicates a misalignment of the meshing gears to produce the motion. The fracture surface at the other location was duller, indicating that little or no rubbing occurred, consistent with the fracture occurring after the first fracture with the rubbed surface. The second fracture propagated until the material below the gear teeth could no longer support the stresses of operation and the portion of the gear located between the two fatigue fractures departed the left idler gear. The fatigue was probably initiated by abnormal contact between the left idler gear and the other mating gears, with the relatively recent installation of the left magneto gear being suspect as the likely source of the initiating stressors.",

He said he touched down on the main landing gear \"fairly long\" on the first portion of the turf runway at a speed of about 60 mph. The pilot delayed lowering the tailwheel until the airplane was crossing the asphalt surface and then lowered the tailwheel firmly to the ground. The airplane began to veer left, and the pilot applied full right rudder and a \"slight amount\" of right brake to regain directional control. When the airplane transitioned from the asphalt surface to the turf runway, it abruptly nosed over. The airplane came to rest inverted, incurring substantial damage to the rudder. An examination of the runway's asphalt to turf transition section revealed that the airplane's main landing gear tires dug into the turf as it left the slightly higher asphalt. The pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures during the landing and rollout. While the airplane was being repaired after the accident, a mechanic determined that the bolts holding the main wheel halves in position were excessively long, causing the wheel halves to separate and the brake discs to change position when the airplane transitioned from the asphalt to the turf runway.

He and the other balloon pilots flying that day compared the weather information and determined that the weather was good enough to fly. About 45 minutes into the flight, at 3,000 feet above ground level, the pilot noticed that the other balloons flying nearby were \"screaming up and down\" and that, within 5 minutes, the wind, which had been carrying them easterly at 6 to 8 knots, shifted to the southwest at 30 knots or more. The balloon was getting bounced around, and the wind was not subsiding, so the pilot decided to immediately land the balloon. The pilot briefed the passengers for a high-wind landing and landed the balloon in a conservation area. The basket tipped over and was dragged for about 50 to 60 yards until a wind gust lifted the balloon about 5 feet above the ground. The pilot pulled in the top vent, which put the balloon back on the ground, and it finally stopped moving.A review of meteorological data available at the time of the preflight briefing indicated, in part, that wind from the west existed at 10 knots or less before takeoff. The National Weather Service (NWS) terminal area forecast expected easterly wind shifting to the northwest during the anticipated flight at 13 knots with wind from the north gusting to 23 knots after 1000 mountain daylight time. The NWS area forecast did not expect any high winds across Colorado. The NWS Aviation Forecast Center had no advisories current for low-level turbulence or high winds over Colorado surrounding the anticipated flight. However, shortly after takeoff a sudden increase in windspeed occurred across the region with wind gusts from 20 to 38 knots. The NWS misjudged the timing and underestimated the magnitude of the frontal boundary moving across the region. It is likely that, if the pilot had known about the gusting wind at the time of takeoff, he may not have chosen to fly that day.",

The private pilot was fatally injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed Farmingdale Republic Airport (FRG), Farmingdale, New York at 0850, and was destined for Long Island MacArthur Airport (ISP), Islip, New York. The personal flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Preliminary air traffic control radar and voice communication information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that after departing FRG, the airplane tracked east-southeast before turning north into the class C airspace at ISP. After entering the airspace, the pilot contacted air traffic control (ATC) and stated, \"I need your help sir.\" ATC queried the pilot as to the airplane's location, heading, and destination, and the pilot replied that he was going to ISP, but \"[did not] have visibility.\" When asked if he was declaring an emergency, the pilot replied, \"no.\" Shortly thereafter, the pilot indicated that he intended to return to FRG. ATC acknowledged the transmission, and radar contact was lost shortly thereafter. A witness located near the accident site observed the accident airplane approach from the east and circle his home twice at a \"very low\" altitude. The witness described the airplane \"flying on its side\" in a right-wing-low attitude as it passed over his home the second time, and shortly thereafter, he heard a \"loud boom\" and observed black smoke.

The private pilot, who was the sole occupant, sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the vicinity and a flight plan was not filed. The local flight was being conducted under the provisions of Federal Code of Regulations Part 91. The flight originated from Riverview, Michigan, about 1125.The single-seat gyrocopter wreckage was resting in a deep ditch on the north side of Sherman Road near the intersection of Wunsch Road in Moorland Township near Ravenna, MI. Evidence at the accident site showed that the gyrocopter had impacted 30-foot high power lines, consequently breaking the two of the lines. The power line pole on the north side of Sherman Road was broken and unattached to its base. The pilot's headgear showed thermal damage to the face shield and soot was evident inside of the shield and around the face relief of the helmet, consistent with electrical arcing. The helmet was found in a ditch just west of Wunsch Road about 40 feet from the wreckage.The gyrocopter's rotor mast was broken off, about seat height. The rotor blades were coned upward consistent with low RPM and high loading. The trailing edges of the blades exhibited buckling between fasteners. One rotor blade had scuff marks on the bottom side. The other blade had buckling failure in the aft direction. One of the propeller blades of the pusher propeller was separated and was found about 50 yards beyond the wreckage. The broken blade leading edge exhibited leading edge marks consistent with contact with the broken power line wires.  The Volkswagen engine appeared to be mostly intact. The crank would rotate by hand, but was limited due to adjacent impact damage. Automotive gasoline was present in the fuel filter and some gas was dripping out of the carburetor when first responders arrived. The broken ends of the power lines showed some broom straw signatures, some cut failures, and some right angle bending near the wire failures. The wires consisted of five aluminum wires wrapped about  a steel core.  ",

On the morning of the accident, the owner\u2019s brother joined him at a remote turf airstrip in mountainous terrain to conduct a flight. The brother, who was also a pilot, took the aft cockpit seat, which was the primary pilot position in the airplane. The owner took the forward cockpit seat. The brother conducted the engine start, taxi-out, run-up, and takeoff, which were all normal. During the climbout, the owner realized that the airplane was not performing as it should, and, when he asked his brother about it, his brother reported that the engine was losing power. The owner took control of the airplane and began a turnback to the airport, and the engine lost total power shortly thereafter. An attempt to restart the engine was unsuccessful, and the airplane landed short of the runway. Examination of the airport revealed an oil spray trail on the turf that began at the parking location and extended along the taxi route and through the takeoff path. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed a significant oil streak on the exterior side of the airplane that emanated from the oil cooler. The engine was also devoid of oil. Detailed examination of the oil cooler revealed deformation of its containment frame and damage to some of the unit\u2019s oil tubes, which included separation of the cooling fins from the tubes and several holes in the tubes that permitted oil to escape the cooler. The damage signatures were not consistent with preaccident or postaccident impact or other structural deformation damage. The damage signatures were somewhat, but not completely, consistent with an internal overpressure of the oil cooler; however, the reasons for the internal overpressure could not be determined during postaccident examination.\u00a0",

The certified flight instructor and student pilot received fatal injuries. The helicopter was owned and operated by Precision Flight Training Incorporated, of Newberg. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The local instructional flight was being operated in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and a flight plan was not filed. The operator reported the flight departed 17S about 2200.A witness, who is a helicopter mechanic, reported that after observing the helicopter depart to the northwest of the airport at about 500 ft above ground level, he heard the engine roll back (power reduction), which was followed by the helicopter starting an auto rotation. The witness reported that he heard the main rotor blades flutter, and then heard the engine rpms increase, followed by hearing the drive belts squeal prior to the impact. A second witness, who was located at the departure airport, stated that he heard a high-pitched squealing noise, similar to that of an ungreased belt on a car, followed by a sound similar to a backfire. The witness opined that prior to the accident he heard the helicopter operating at the airport, and at that time there were no audible concerns with the helicopter.A postaccident survey of the accident site revealed that the helicopter impacted terrain upright on a southerly heading, and subsequently came to rest in a somewhat upright position oriented on a northerly heading. With the exception of the tail boom, tail rotors, tail rotor gearbox and associated components, and two of the three main rotor blades, the helicopter was destroyed as a result of impact forces and thermal damage. The helicopter was recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

The pilot banked the airplane slightly to the right to avoid an approaching tree line and initiated an emergency landing to an open grass field.  Subsequently, the airplane impacted terrain.  The pilot stated that the airplane was last refueled using fuel from five five-gallon plastic containers prior to the flight.  He noted there was 12 gallons of fuel in the left fuel tank, and three gallons in the right fuel tank.  Examination of the airplane's fuel system revealed a light brown milky substance in the carburetor bowl and both wing fuel tanks.

The pilot stated that personnel from Naples Airport Authority were busy and unable to take several passengers to the airplane from the fixed base operator (FBO).  During the preflight, he noted the light pole was just behind the outboard side of the right wing.  He obtained his IFR clearance and was cleared to taxi.  He began to taxi without a marshaller and with a row of airplanes ahead of his location, he initiated an immediate left turn to maintain right wingtip clearance with parked airplanes.  During the turn, the right horizontal stabilizer contacted the light pole.  Individuals nearby who witnessed the collision ran near the airplane and got the pilots attention who then secured the airplane.  According to a Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness inspector who examined the airplane, the leading edge of the right horizontal stabilizer and the forward and aft spars of the vertical stabilizer were damaged.  Examination of the area where the airplane had been parked revealed double concentric circles pole painted on the ramp centered on the light pole; the outer circle had a radius of approximately 32 feet.  Radial lines were painted on the ramp from the base of the light pole to the inner circle line.
