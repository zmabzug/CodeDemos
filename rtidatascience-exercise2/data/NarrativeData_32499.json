During the test, the engine experienced an uncontained failure of the high pressure turbine (HPT) stage 1 disk.  Examination of the pieces of the disk revealed the disk failed from an intergranular fatigue crack that originated from a small depression on the blade slot bottom aft corner radius.  There were two other intergranular fatigue cracks that originated from small depressions on other blade slot bottom aft corner radii.  Intergranular fatigue cracks are typically associated with very high stresses that exceed the material's capability.  GE issued service bulletins (SB) to require inspections of CF6-80A and -80C2 HPT stage 1 disks that the FAA mandated with airworthiness directives (AD), but the SBs and AD did not establish a compliance schedule.  When the SBs and AD was revised to establish a compliance schedule, the schedule was such that disks with much higher cycles since new, than those that had previously failed or were found cracked, were permitted to remain in service. On August 26, 2006, the Safety Board issued safety recommendation A-06-60 through A-06-64, which addressed these deficiencies.

The inadequate design of the disk resulted in a high stress area in the blade slot bottom aft corner that was at or nearly at the material's capability so that there was no damage tolerance such that a small dent could cause a crack to initiate and propagate to failure.  Contributing to the disk's failure was the FAA's failure to mandate an accelerated inspection schedule after a previous CF6-80A uncontained HPT stage 1 disk failure had occurred and after other CF6-80A HPT disks had been found during routine overhaul to have cracks in the blade slot bottom aft corners."

The density altitude was reported to be 7,200 feet msl. On the second flight, he had another three passengers and 38 gallons of fuel. Density altitude had increased to 8,500 feet msl. The mixture was leaned. The pilot said \"the plane did not develop the same amount of power as on the previous takeoff\" and the takeoff roll was longer. \"The plane rotated approximately 200 yards before the departure end of the runway, and did not accelerate beyond 70 knots.\" He lowered the nose to gain airspeed. Airspeed slowly increased and the airplane \"was ascending at about the same rate as the terrain. Approximately eight seconds after take off, I felt a slight surge in power and lifted the nose.\" He then heard a \"pop\" and \"felt a slight shudder.\" He concluded he had \"grazed over the top of some object with the stinger at the rear of the plane.\" Concerned about possible damage to the airplane, the pilot radioed the airport manager and asked that he inspect the airplane when he made a low pass over the airport. He lowered the landing gear and flew over the runway. The airport manager advised him that \"everything looked fine.\" The pilot then proceeded with the flight. As the passengers disembarked, they noticed the rear foot step had been knocked off. Further investigation revealed a gash under the right wing, 2 feet outboard from the fuselage, that extended from just aft of the leading edge to the flap. Based on a maximum gross weight of 3,600 pounds and a density altitude of 8,500 feet,  it was computed that the airplane would require 2,100 feet for the takeoff roll and would climb approximately 600 feet per minute. According to the engine manufacturer, a full power setting is to be used for pre-takeoff leaning on all normally-aspirated reciprocating engines. This information is contained in the various engine handbooks. If the engine were to be leaned at a lower power setting, the mixture would become richer as power was increased beyond the setting used for leaning, and would result in lower rpm and reduced horsepower.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to achieve an adequate climb rate, resulting in an inflight collision with the sign. Contributing factors were the pilot's improper mixture leaning procedure, the high density altitude, his failure to abort the takeoff in a timely manner, and the highway sign near the end of the runway."

During the climbout, and at 50-60 mph and approximately 140 feet above ground, the engine rapidly lost power.  The pilot executed an autorotation landing from an airspeed/altitude condition slightly outside the limitations of the height-velocity diagram and landed hard.  Post crash examination revealed that the #1 cylinder fuel injector line had separated approximately one inch outboard of the injector unit.  Metallurgical examination revealed the separation as fatigue.  The engine log showed this to be the second #1 cylinder fuel injector line separation in recent history.  Further examination revealed that 3 of the hold down bolts for the #3 cylinder had separated and metallurgical examination revealed the separations as fatigue.  The flange for the #3 cylinder was observed to be painted with primer paint measuring from about 0.0014 inch to 0.0028 inch in thickness.  Both cylinder hold down plates were examined and showed fretting and rubbing damage.  According to Textron Lycoming Service Bulletin 271A, the primer paint thickness on the flange should not exceed 0.0005 inch.  According to the engine log the engine underwent a major overhaul on July 8, 1994, during which the '...engine was painted assembled and delivered to Cascade Airframe Repair....'

The helicopter impacted the parking lot in a nose down attitude on the left side.  In an interview several days after the accident, the pilot said she was at about 100 feet agl, and had slowed to 20 - 25 knots when she felt the helicopter nose come up and to the right gently, but not as a yaw or a roll.  She said she corrected left with the cyclic, and the helicopter responded with a significant and violent roll to the left.  She remembered the helicopter starting to spin (at least once), and saw the buildings of the strip mall.  She then put the cyclic to the full left to avoid the building.  She said she saw the hydraulic caution light on, but did not hear the aural warning.  She then grabbed the cyclic with both hands and pulled back and right, but it didn't move.  The anti-torque pedals appeared to work and stopped the spin.  The helicopter then impacted the ground.  The engine continued to run after the ground impact, and a surviving passenger and multiple rescue personnel moved numerous switches in the cockpit in an attempt to shutdown the engine, hence all postimpact switch positions are unreliable.  A guarded hydraulic system on/off toggle switch is mounted on the end of the collective control  that allows the pilot to manually turn off the hydraulic system.  The collective control and the switch guard were damaged in the impact sequence; the hydraulic switch was found in the OFF position.  The systems control panel on the center pedestal has 36 back-lighted, mechanically latched push-on/push-off switches.  The hydraulic test switch, which deactivates the hydraulic system for a preflight check of the accumulator pressures, is located diagonally next to the landing light switch.  The pedestal switch positions were documented the morning after the accident, and the hydraulic test switch was in the OFF position (OFF is normal, ON turns the system off).  In the 3 months prior to the accident, four discrepancies were written against the helicopter for various control system problems, including stiff flight controls, excessive control inputs required for normal flight, and nuisance hydraulic warning light and horn activations.  The most recent write-up was 1 month prior to the accident.  The company maintenance department's corrective actions included cleaning the control system bearings, replacing the left hand and collective hydraulic system actuators, and repairing damaged electrical wiring and cannon plugs.  No evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction was found in examinations of the control system and functional testing of the hydraulic system components.

On July 18, 1998, about 1840 local (equivalent of central daylight time), a Bell UH-1H helicopter, operated by the Colombian National Police (PNC), as PNC-159, crashed in a swampy/wooded area about 1 mile north of the village of Nueva Colonia.  The two pilots, two flight crewmembers, and three passengers were fatally injured.  The passenger-transport flight from Turbo to Carepa, Colombia, had stopped at a soccer field at the Nueva Colonia.  It remained turning for approximately 20 minutes, awaiting, according to witnesses, the passage of a weather system which included low visibility and thunder showers.  The helicopter was observed to take off from the field, about the time of official sunset, in low visibility and low clouds.  It then circled low level to the north of the field.  Ground witnesses observed a lightning flash, and shortly thereafter heard the sound of impact.  ",

The three flightcrew members and one security guard on board were killed, and a motorist was killed on the ground. The airplane was destroyed by impact and a postcrash fire. The cargo flight, with a scheduled destination of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, was conducted on an instrument flight rules flight plan and operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a Supplemental air carrier. Prior to takeoff, the airplane was misloaded to produce a more aft center of gravity and a correspondingly incorrect stabilizer trim setting.  This precipitated an extreme pitch-up at rotation.  Because of the incorrect stabilizer trim setting the pilots could not gain adequate control of the airplane before it struck the ground  : ",

Contributing to the accident was the failure of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to adequately monitor Fine Air's operational control responsibilities for cargo loading and the failure of the FAA to ensure that known cargo-related deficiencies were corrected at Fine Air.

The airplane was descending through 450 feet agl when he decided that he was too low to make the runway and he initiated a go-around.  He added power, and did not bring the flaps up.  He pulled the stick back and established a positive pitch up attitude.  He thought that the engine responded, but the airplane was still descending and it impacted terrain about 50 yards from the airport.  During a post accident examination, the engine ran successfully through the range of power settings from idle up to 2,600 rpm.  The engine ran for approximately 3 minutes.  Downloaded information from the Avidyne Engine Data Log indicated that during the last 6 seconds of recorded data, the rpm went from 1,200 to a maximum of 2,300, manifold pressure went from 8.8 to 21.4 inches, and fuel flow went from 1.9 to 19.2.  The recorded data did not show any anomalies in power development for the flight.",

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident with clear skies and unrestricted visibilities.  The pilot reported the loss of engine power about 16 minutes prior to the accident and requested clearance to the nearest airport.  Air traffic control (ATC) issued vectors to the Southwest Michigan Regional Airport (BEH).  About 10 minutes prior to the accident, the airplane was positioned approximately 1.3 nm north of BEH at 13,500 feet.  The pilot elected to follow ATC vectors verses circling down over BEH.  ATC provided vectors for runway 27 at BEH.  Witnesses to the accident reported seeing the airplane \"spiraling down and crashing into the ground.\"  The wreckage was located on the extended runway 27 centerline, about 1.12 nm from the runway threshold.  The distribution of the wreckage was consistent with a stall/spin accident.  Approximately four minutes before the accident, the airplane was on a 9.5 nm final approach at 6,700 feet.  Between 9.5 and 5.3 nm the airspeed fluctuated between 119 and 155 knots, and the descent rate varied between 1,550 and 2,600 feet/min.  Between 5.3 nm and the last radar return at 1.5 nm the airspeed dropped from 155 to 78 knots.  According to the Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) the accident airplane should be flown at best glide speed (92 knots) after a loss of engine power.  An average engine-out descent rate of 700 feet/min is achieved when best glide speed is maintained during engine-out descents.  An engine teardown inspection revealed that the crankshaft was fractured at the number five crankpin journal.  Visual examination of the crankshaft (p/n 13F27738, s/n V537920968) showed a fatigue-type fracture through the cheek, aft of the number five crankpin journal.  The exact cause of the crankshaft failure could not be determined, due to mechanical damage at the fatigue initiation point.

He received instruction in weight-shift aircraft with the goal of obtaining his sport pilot endorsement. On the day of the accident, the pilot received his solo endorsement from his instructor and made a 1-hour solo flight. After resting for about an hour, the pilot began his second solo flight. The accident occurred about 40 minutes into this flight. According to witnesses, the pilot performed several touch-and-go landings without incident. During the initial takeoff climb following another touch-and-go landing, the aircraft climbed at a \"steep\" angle, and at an altitude of about 100 to 200 feet above ground level, the aircraft rolled left, nosed down, spiraled and descended to ground impact. One witness stated that the engine remained at takeoff power throughout the entire event. An on-scene examination of the wreckage conducted by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector indicated the aircraft impacted in a near-vertical attitude. The examination revealed no evidence of any preimpact damage or discrepancies. An autopsy determined the pilot's cause of death was blunt force trauma, and the findings in the autopsy report did not include any notations of preexisting disease. The reason the pilot lost control of the aircraft could not be determined.",

The minimum glideslope crossing altitude at the initial approach fix was 4,484 feet msl.  Radar data indicated the airplane tracked inbound on headings varying from 360 degrees to 270 degrees.  Approximately 6.7 miles from the initial approach fix, the airplane descended from 4,600 feet to 3,400 feet, at a rate of 850 fpm.  The last radar hit was recorded at 3,400 feet, approximately 4.7 miles from the initial approach fix.  The airplane was located about 11 miles from the end of the runway, at an elevation of 2,461 feet, about 300 feet below the peak of a ridgeline.  Examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical deficiencies.  According to the pilot's toxicology test results, 6.51 (ug/ml, ug/g) of DESIPRAMINE was detected in his blood, and DESIPRAMINE and IMIPRAMINE were detected in his urine.  The pilot's wife reported that the pilot had been taking Desipramine for approximately 10 years, to treat depression.  She stated that she was a doctor and had prescribed the Desipramine to him.  A review of the pilot's FAA medical file revealed he never reported taking Desipramine, and never reported any history of mental disorders.  Imipramine is a prescription antidepressant, and often results in sedation and psychomotor impairment in healthy adults.  Desipramine is a metabolite of imipramine and a prescription antidepressant in its own right.  The levels of desipramine found in the pilot's toxicology report were more than 20 times the expected level for chronic use of a typical dose.

Most of the spray passes were consistent in terms of heading, altitude, etc., as recorded by the on-board global positioning system (GPS) receiver. The chief pilot, who was flying another company airplane at the time of the accident, noticed the accident pilot returning to the home base and asked him if he was landing. The accident pilot responded that he wanted to go back and make a few more passes. Readout of the GPS receiver revealed that during the last 22 seconds of flight, the heading remained nearly constant at 030 degrees, the altitude decreased to an adjusted value of 48 feet above ground level, and the groundspeed increased to the last recorded value of approximately 152 mph. A witness familiar with agricultural spray operations reported hearing a normal propeller sound during the last 2 to 3 spray passes; however, during the last pull-up and turn maneuver, the witness stated that the sound from the propeller was not the same at the end of the procedure as it had been previously. He reported that it started low and then became louder and at a higher pitch that seemed to remain elevated a moment too long before he heard the sound of the impact. The airplane came to rest inverted in a corn field approximately 1220 feet and 223 degrees from the last recorded GPS data point, though no determination could be made as to what maneuver(s) was or were performed during the last portion of the flight. No swath thru the corn was noted and there was no evidence of forward energy displacement on the ground. Inspection of the airplane revealed extensive damage to the left wing, consistent with ground contact first. There was no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction to the flight controls, engine, or propeller. At the time of impact, all propeller blades were in the normal operating range.Although the airplane was equipped with a Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 model engine, which was not called for in the  airplane type certificate, the airplane had been flown in that configuration since March 1992. The PT6A-27 is an approved engine for a S2R-T15 airframe, which according to the engineering manager for the airplane type certificate holder, is nearly identical to the accident airframe and as such would not result in any unusual flight characteristics. Recent work to the airplane within the last month consisted of reinstallation of the power section and a new propeller. The removal of the propeller 11 days before the accident was to replace the spinner dome; the propeller was reinstalled 4 days before the accident. Earlier on the day of the accident the airplane was flown by the chief pilot of the operator for approximately 14 minutes.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The captain stated he was the pilot flying and the takeoff and climb to the cruise altitude of 33,000  feet was conducted within normal parameters. After level off the relief pilot left the cockpit to begin his rest period. Within a few minutes he observed that the number 2 engine master warning light was illuminated, as well as a level 3 alert on the Engine and Alert Display and a red light on the number 2 fire handle and fuel shutoff lever. The fire bell did not activate. He and the first officer performed the memory and initial action items on the hard card checklists for an engine fire and shutdown the No. 2 engine. In addition, the captain discharged an engine fire bottle. The engine fire light continued to illuminate. The captain then fired a second engine fire bottle. The engine fire light continued to be illuminated. The captain requested that the relief pilot return to the cockpit. He then contacted  Air Traffic Control (ATC) and told them that their No. 2 engine was on fire and that they intended to land at the nearest suitable field. ATC responded that Charlotte was 35 miles away with a 10,000 foot runway. He asked for radar vectors and an immediate descent into Charlotte. They were given a lower altitude. The first officer initiated fuel dumping. The relief pilot returned to the cockpit and he asked the relief pilot and the first officer to run the checklists. As they descended the aircraft encountered heavy rain, light hail, and moderate turbulence. In addition, they observed a bright flash to the left of the nose, which might have been a lightning strike. As they completed the descent and approach checklists he told the crew to expect an emergency evacuation upon landing and directed the first officer to so inform the flight attendants. The aircraft was configured for an engine out approach and they reviewed the loss of a second engine procedure. The remainder of the approach, touchdown and landing roll occurred within normal parameters. He brought the airplane to a stop on the runway. The engine fire indication remained illuminated. The relief pilot stated they did not terminate fuel dumping prior to landing. They completed the items on the evacuation checklist. He then ordered an evacuation of the airplane. According to Delta Air Lines representatives, examination of the No. 2 engine by company maintenance personnel found one fire loop chafed through an adjacent cable, an integrated drive generator (IDG) feeder cable, inside the No. 2 engine cowling This allowed a direct 115 volt AC connection between the IDG and the fire detection control unit. The result was an electrical short and complete failure of the detection control unit that was indicated in the cockpit as a  fire warning. There was no evidence of fire in the No. 2 engine. Boeing Service  Bullettin MD11-71-086 was issued on May 21, 1996. The subject of the service bulletin was \"Power Plant - Electrical Harness - Replace/Modify Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) Wire Harness Support Brackets\". On May 21, 2001, Boeing elevated the service bulletin to the \"Alert\" level. Boeing recommended that aircraft operators accomplish the service bulletin within 1 year. According to Delta Air Lines personnel, in November 2001, Delta Air Lines Aircraft Engineering issued a Engineering Order to comply with Alert Service Bulletin MD11-71A086. The Engineering Order stated that all engines should be inspected and modified by November 2002. All three engines on the accident aircraft were inspected and modified in accordance with the Engineering Order on March 3, 2002. On March 28, 2002, the No. 2 engine was changed and the engine installed had not been modified by the Engineering Order.The Delta Airlines descent, approach, and before landing checklists dated June 30, 2000, and which were in use at the time of the accident, required the pilots to check the Engine and Alert Display. When fuel dumping is activated, a message is displayed on the Engine and Alert Display.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the aircraft operator to comply with, in a timely manner, on the No. 2 engine, Boeing Alert Service Bulletin MD11-71A086, resulting in the integrated drive generator feeder cable chaffing through a fire warning loop and failure of the fire warning system due to electrical damage. This resulted in a continuous indication in the cockpit of a No. 2 engine fire, an emergency descent and landing, and injuries to passengers during the subsequent emergency evacuation of the airplane."

The pilot attempted to maintain directional control with rudder input, but the airplane veered to the right and departed the runway. Initial examination of the airplane at the site revealed that the nose landing gear had collapsed and the attachment components between the nose landing gear actuator and the engine mount were fractured. Each of the right and left two-piece attachment feet were fractured at the nose landing gear actuator attach location. Detailed examination of the right foot showed evidence of fatigue, which covered a 0.75-inch arc and approximately 0.04 inches of the 0.06-inch wall thickness of the foot. The left foot also showed evidence of fatigue, which covered a 0.35-inch arc and was approximately 0.03 inches deep. The manufacturer had issued a series of Service Bulletins (SB 1103, with subsequent revisions A, B, and C) for PA-46-350P models that required inspections for cracks in the engine mounts in the areas of the nose landing gear actuator attachment feet. Inspections were to take place at the next regularly scheduled maintenance event, and at each 100 hours time in service or annual inspection, whichever occurred first. Records showed that SB 1103B was accomplished on the accident airplane during an annual inspection in 2007, but records of subsequent annual inspections in 2008 and 2009 showed that SB1103 was not accomplished. Previous nose gear failures and runway excursions resulted in the redesign of the original engine mount due to compliance (flexibility) in the engine mount actuator attach feet structure. This compliance issue was sometimes exasperated at various speeds, resulting in a high speed shimmy effect and subsequent uncommanded left or right turn of the nose wheel during takeoff and/or landing. The new engine mount incorporates a one piece design at the actuator attach point, eliminating the two piece feet design. The one piece design provides a less compliant structure, which prevents relative motion between the two feet in the original engine mount design.The Federal Aviation Administration did not mandate the actions outlined in SB 1103B, but compliance could have alerted the operator of any problems because the SB inspection criteria called for examinations of the engine mount in the areas where the fatigue cracks were located. Replacement of the engine mount with the new design that had one-piece nose landing gear actuator attachment feet would have relieved the operator of the manufacturer's repetitive inspection requirement, but because the accident airplane still had the welded two-piece attachment feet it was subject to the repetitive inspection per the service bulletin.",
            "probable_cause": "The inadequate design of the engine mount by the manufacturer, resulting in collapse of the nose landing gear. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the operator to adhere to the manufacturer's suggested engine mount inspection schedule."

The pilot, who was also the builder of the airplane, was on an instrument flight.  While established in cruise flight at an elevation of approximately 5,000 feet mean sea level and 200 knots, radar contact was suddenly lost when the airplane entered a rapid descent.  Review of the aircraft's radar data revealed primary radar returns were located near the aircraft's mode C returns near the time of the upset.  Aerial and ground searches using trajectory data analysis on the primary radar returns commenced; however, no additional components were located.  During a post-accident examination of the wreckage, investigators were unable to identify the stabilizer.  The day prior to the accident the pilot indicated that he was experiencing control problems with the elevator trim system on the airplane.  A manufacturer of another experimental aircraft kit, similar in design to the accident airplane kit, performed structural testing of his kit.  These tests indicated that the flight loading could exceed the structural strength of the horizontal and vertical stabilizer control surface so modifications were made in his model to increase the structural strength.  These structural modifications were not completed in the accident airplane, nor were they required.  There is no requirement for experimental aircraft manufacturers or kit suppliers to analyze the structural integrity of the airplane throughout its operating envelope, nor does a builder have to establish the adequacy of the design during flight tests.

At the refueling stop, the pilot/owner asked a passenger to show the refueler the location of the fuel caps.  The refueler only had experience pumping jet fuel to single point aircraft.  Per the refueler's request, the passenger advised him when 40 gallons was pumped.  The refueling took place in a dark area, and the light for the fuel truck meter was inoperative.  The passenger misread the meter, and instead of receiving 40 gallons of fuel, the airplane received 4 gallons.  The mistake was noted by another FBO employee after the airplane had departed, but he was unable to contact the pilot/owner.  The airplane's fuel gauges were inoperative, and indicated half full, even when empty.  Neither pilot visually confirmed the amount of fuel onboard prior to takeoff.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to verify the amount of fuel onboard before takeoff.  Factors in the accident were the airplane being under fueled, the refueler's experience, the airplane's inoperative fuel gauges, unsuitable terrain for landing, and night lighting conditions."

Examination of the engine revealed a 1-inch by 6-inch hole, in the engine crankcase adjacent to the number two cylinder, and a fractured number two cylinder connecting rod.  Additionally, the crankshaft installed in the engine, required the installation of sludge tubes in the crank-pins.  Examination of the crankshaft revealed that the sludge tubes had not been installed.  According to a representative of the engine manufacturer, the crankshaft installed in the engine was not approved for use in that model engine.  Additionally, the absence of the crankshaft sludge tubes would not allow pressure oil to reach the connecting rod bearings and the connecting rod bearings would only receive splash, vapor and centrifugal force oil.  The engine had been operated for about 940 hours since it was overhauled on April 16, 1990 and there were no logbook entries which indicated the crankshaft had been removed or replaced since the overhaul.

The wind was light and variable as he made a stabilized approach. The airplane touched down long, bounced, and was firmly on the ground by midfield. When the pilot applied brakes in the sand runway, the wheels locked, the airplane skidded, and the pilot lost directional control. Approaching the runway's end, the airplane veered off its left side, went down an incline and nosed down. The pilot had relied upon a non-government publication in his preflight planning that appeared to indicate the airstrip was open for public use. The Federal Aviation Administration's aeronautical chart, while not depicting the (uncharted) airstrip's location, did show that the area was within the boundary of National Park Service-administered land, and that landing without authorization was prohibited.",

To ensure clearing a fence that had been erected at the very edge of the airstrip that penetrates approximately 4 feet into the 20 to 1 glide slope I held power a couple of seconds longer than usual.  Just at the point of touchdown I withdrew the flaps and had landed hard on the main wheels and had a rise of 3 to 4 feet.  The second contact was also on the mains with less rise-approx[imately] 2 feet.  Final contact with the ground was on the nose gear. At that time the aircraft was moving very slowly and the nosewheel did not collapse quickly-rather it gently folded under the plane and the plane stopped forward motion in approx[imately] 10 feet.'
