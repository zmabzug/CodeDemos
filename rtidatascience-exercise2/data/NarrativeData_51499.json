The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed by the ground impact and post-impact fire. The flight was operated by Global Positioning Services, Inc., under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 with no flight plan filed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The local flight departed Birchwood Airport about 1315.According to an operator's representative, the pilot had been conducting practice flights with a 150-foot long-line attached to a fluid-filled, 55-gallon barrel in preparation for an upcoming project. Several witnesses at the airport said that they saw the helicopter flying on the day of the accident with the barrel suspended beneath it by the long-line. One witness who was flying his airplane on short final for runway 20 when the accident occurred had heard the helicopter pilot communicating on the airport common traffic advisory frequency, providing regular position reports as he maneuvered the helicopter. That witness saw the helicopter maneuver from a hover over the end of runway 20 with the barrel suspended on the long-line to the area east of the runway on the ramp near where the accident occurred. Other witnesses reported that the ramp location is where the pilot typically sets down the barrel and lands the helicopter. The airplane pilot reported that he saw the nose of the helicopter pitch up before it rolled to the left, descended, and impacted the ground. Other witnesses on the ground reported hearing two loud \"bang\" sounds a few seconds apart and said that, when they looked to see what made the sound, they saw the helicopter on the ground in flames. Initial examination of the helicopter at the accident site revealed that the fuselage came to rest on its left side on a gravel road adjacent to the paved airport ramp, and much of the cockpit and cabin structures were consumed by fire. The tail boom and tail rotor were on the ground aft of the burned fuselage. The main rotor mast assembly with the main rotor hub attached was found separated on the ground several feet away from the fuselage and engine. One main rotor blade was separated outboard of the hub near the blade root, and the other main rotor blade was attached in its entirety and damaged. All separated pieces of main rotor blade were located at the accident site. The length of a linear ground scar near the fuselage was consistent with the length of a main rotor blade. The barrel with which the pilot had been practicing was found on its side in the grass adjacent to the airport ramp. The long-line was attached to the barrel and was not attached to the helicopter's pilot-controlled, belly-mounted cargo hook.The closest official weather observation station is located at the Birchwood Airport. At 1416, an Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) was reporting, in part: Wind, 300 degrees (true) at 3 knots; visibility, 10 statute miles; clouds and sky condition, clear; temperature, 57 degrees F; dew point, 43 degrees F; altimeter, 30.10 inHg.",

After the first takeoff, while on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, the pilot noticed an engine rpm decrease, and he responded by checking the engine controls. After the control check, the pilot re-checked the tachometer, and noticed that the rpm continued to decrease. He was unable to maintain altitude, and set up for a forced landing in a clearing. The airplane struck vegetation prior to the clearing, and came to rest inverted. The airplane was approved to use automotive gasoline. The associated operating limitations prohibited the use of automotive gasoline that contained ethanol, due to its adverse effects on engine components and operation.

The pilot holds a private rotorcraft helicopter rating, and had accrued 58.5 hours in the accident helicopter make and model, with 19.2 hours as pilot-in-command.  The pilot reported that about 15 feet above ground level (agl), and about 20 knots, he began adding engine power at the conclusion of the landing approach.  The nose of the helicopter began to rotate to the right, which quickly became very rapid.  The pilot reported that he thought the helicopter made about 5 revolutions.  He said that because of the rotation, he was unable to roll the engine throttle to idle.  Witnesses reported that the helicopter was near midfield in about a 20 foot-high hover when the nose of the helicopter began to rotate to the right and the helicopter began to climb.  The rotations became increasingly rapid as it reached about 100 feet agl.  The helicopter then descended to the ground while rotating, and came to rest on the turf along the south edge of a runway.  The landing gear collapsed, and the tail rotor blades fractured about mid-span.  The main rotor blades continued to turn, and the engine remained running for a short period of time. The accident sequence was recorded on an on-board video camera mounted in an airplane that was taxiing for takeoff as the helicopter was landing.  The camera captured images of the accident helicopter coming into view at the right edge of the camera screen.  The helicopter appeared to be in a stable, slow speed hover about 15 to 20 feet agl.  The helicopter then began to rotate to the right and climb before descending.  It spun about 7 turns before ground contact.  The helicopter was examined after recovery by the NTSB investigator-in-charge.  No preimpact mechanical anomalies were discovered.  The reported wind at the airport was from 250 degrees (true) at 4 knots.  The FAA and the U.S. Army have published information about the loss of directional control that produces a right yaw, other than a mechanical malfunction, which is also called loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE).  LTE may be attributed to operations conducted in a high power, low airspeed environment, including left crosswind conditions, wind conditions that may produce weather cocking or weathervaning, a tail rotor vortex ring state, or during the loss of translational lift.  Tail rotor effectiveness may be influenced by gross weight, density altitude, low airspeed flight where the tail rotor is required to produce 100 percent of the directional control, and any droop in main rotor rpm.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of tail rotor effectiveness during aerial taxi, and the pilot's delayed remedial action to counteract a rapid right yaw, which resulted in an in-flight loss of directional control, and in-flight collision with terrain.  A factor contributing to the accident was the pilot's lack of total experience in helicopters."

The airport employee informed the pilot that the \"winds were from 180 at 12 knots gusting to 17.\"  The pilot then responded that he would be landing on runway 18, and was advised by the employee that there was no \"runway 18.\" The pilot then stated that he would land on runway 27, and shortly thereafter said that he would land on runway 22. The employee said that out of curiosity he stepped outside to witness the approach of the airplane. He said that the airplane was southwest of the airport moving northeast perpendicular to runway 22, at an altitude of approximately 500 feet. He watched as the airplane was on a left base for runway 22. He said that the airplane overshot the runway and began a \"tight, low right turn\" away from the airport. Shortly thereafter, the airplane stalled and completed two revolutions before it was lost from his sight. Examination of the airframe, flight controls, engine assemblies and accessories revealed no evidence of a pre-crash mechanical failure or malfunction. A forensic toxicology test was performed on specimens from the pilot by the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The specimens contained, Tramadol (also known by the trade name Ultram), which is used for the management of moderate to severe pain. The level of Tramadol found in the pilot's blood on post-mortem toxicology testing was at least twice that of maximal regular doses of the substance. Single doses have been shown to cause mild impairment of psychomotor abilities in healthy volunteers. Diphenhydramine was also found in the blood of the pilot. The pilot may have been impaired, at that time, due to the use of Tramadol or Diphenhydramine or both. ",

The aircraft began to skip and tipped to the right.  The airplane came to rest off the left side of the runway.  The right wing dragged on the runway.  The landing gear gouged the asphalt.  The prop struck the dirt alongside the runway.  The wheel was found lying on the runway.  The right spring on the tail wheel was found detached.  The accident airplane's annual inspection was completed on May 25, 1999 and accumulated nine hours of flight time since the annual.  The axle was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory for examination.  An excerpt from the laboratory's report states, 'The circumferential portion of the fracture surface was located on the inboard side of the circular plate at the top of the axle and had a dark brown and rubbed appearance, indicative of a crack that has been in existence for an extended time.  This portion of the fracture was directly adjacent to the circular plate, through either the weld of heat affected zone adjacent to the weld between the upper struts and the circular plate.  The circumferential portion of the fracture contained what appeared to be a wide but shallow crack arrest position, suggestive of crack initiation from a wide area approximately in the center of this portion of the fracture.'  The pilot's safety recommendation states, 'The crack in the axle was tucked within the brake cylinder.  The only way to inspect it would be removal of the wheel & brake assembly.' ",

The non-federal control tower was manned by one controller who was handling 3 aircraft at the time of the accident.  After taking off from runway 22, the Cessna was cleared to depart on a westerly heading. The Cessna pilot intended to drift northeast and intercept highway 64 to follow it to the west. The Cessna pilot missed the highway and drifted too far to the northeast into the final approach course for runway 13.  The pilot of the Piper descended his airplane after observing the climbing Cessna at his 2 o'clock position on a collision course.  The Cessna pilot pitched his airplane up to avoid the descending Piper.  The collision occurred at 1,400 feet MSL, approximately 2 miles northwest of the runway 13.  Following the collision, both airplanes landed at the Tyler Airport without further incident.  Examination of the airplanes revealed that the top half of the rudder and the vertical stabilizer sustained structural damage on the Piper.

The certified flight instructor (CFI) and the private pilot sustained serious injuries.  According to the CFI, the flight's purpose was to meet the dual instruction requirements of the Wings Program.  The CFI's accident report stated, \"Upon the completion of the turn the engine lost about 50 [percent] of its power.  We thought that we could make it to Kingman Airport and started a course for it.  [Approximately three and a half] miles from the airport the engine stopped [abruptly] the prop continued to windmill we made an approach to a wheat field.  The pilot made a very good approach and a smooth landing.  After approximately 400 ft of ground roll we encountered a terrace.  It appears that this caused the nose wheel to shear off.  With nothing to support the nose it caused the airplane to flip over on its back.\"  The last annual inspection of the airframe and engine was on September 2, 2004, and the tachometer read 3,191.7 hours at the time of that inspection.  That annual inspection's endorsement indicated that the number two and four cylinders were removed during that inspection.  The number two cylinder was found with an eroded exhaust.  That number two cylinder was replaced with an overhauled cylinder.  On-scene examination of the bottom of the fuselage revealed a trail of oil on its left side.  Examination of the engine revealed a hole in the top of the crankcase near the number two cylinder.  Examination of the oil pressure line from the engine to the turbocharger revealed a loose \"B\" nut.  The tachometer read 3,192.1 hours on-scene.  The engine was disassembled and internal examination revealed that the rod ends for the number one and number two cylinders were discolored, deformed, and separated from the crankshaft.  The crankshaft was discolored.  The discoloration present was consistent with the heat produced by a lack of lubrication.  The examination revealed silver colored and copper colored debris in the oil sump.  That debris was consistent with bearing material.  The tee fitting and pressure line with the loose \"B\" nut were removed from the engine case.  The line's end and tee fitting's end were capped off and a fluid under pressure was supplied to the tee fitting.  That fluid was observed leaking from the loose \"B\" nut.",

According to one passenger and multiple witnesses, thunderstorms and lightning were observed at the time of the accident. Extreme weather radar echoes containing thunderstorms were recorded southwest through the east of the accident site. An analysis conducted by Safety Board meteorologists indicates that turbulence, including vertical and horizontal wind changes, would have been associated with this thunderstorm activity. The terrain would have enhanced the intensity of these parameters, resulting in an encounter of a strong convective outflow of approximately 45 knots from the south. Toxicology testing of blood drawn within an hour after the accident detected butalbital (a prescription barbiturate typically used for severe headaches) and diphenhydramine (an over-the-counter antihistamine commonly known by the trade name Benadryl).

The airplane was registered to and operated by Gilleland Aviation, Inc., Georgetown, Texas, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a business flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed. The flight originated at 0947 and was en route to the Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport (KMEZ), Mena, Arkansas. According to the air traffic control (ATC) recordings, at 0947:06, the airplane departed runway 1R and was instructed by the controller to fly runway heading. At 0948:17, the pilot declared an emergency and stated that he \"lost the left engine.\"According to witnesses on the ground, after the airplane departed runway 1R, a left turn was initiated and the airplane's altitude was estimated less than 150 feet above the ground. One witness observed the airplane shortly after it became airborne and heard a reduction in power on one engine before it entered the left turn. Another witness saw the airplane from about 20 yards away. He said the airplane was in a left turn and approached the hangars east of FSI, then the wings were level as it flew west toward FSI. The airplane's landing gear were \"down and locked\", the flaps were extended, the rudder was neutral, and the right engine was at full power. The witness did not see the left engine.  The airplane then disappeared from his view and he heard the sound of an impact.  Another witness observed the airplane in its final seconds before it impacted the FSI building. He said the airplane was on a heading of 240 degrees and was in a \"gradual\" descending left turn. He thought the airplane was going to land on the west runway, but then it collided with the northeast corner of the FSI building. The witness said the landing gear were extended and both propellers were rotating, but he could not determine at what power setting. He said the airplane's left engine struck the building first just below the roof line, followed by the outboard section of the left wing. When the wing impacted the building it separated and the airplane rolled to about 70 degrees bank angle. The nose of the airplane struck the roof of the building and the airplane slid for about 20-30 feet before the tail section came over the top of the airplane followed by a large explosion.  A postimpact fire ensued. Surveillance video from the surrounding buildings was obtained and will be reviewed. The airplane was equipped with a Fairchild Model A100S cockpit voice recorder (CVR). The unit was removed from the wreckage and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for download. The airplane was equipped with two Sandel ST3400 Terrain Awareness and Warning System / Radio Magnetic Indicator (TAWS/RMI) units. These units were retained by the NTSB and will be examined for recorded flight data. At 0953, the automated weather observation at KICT reported wind from 350 degrees and 16 knots, 10 miles of visibility, a few clouds at 15,000 feet, temperature 59\u00b0 Fahrenheit (F), dew point 37\u00b0 F, and altimeter setting 30.12 inches of mercury. The wreckage has been retained for further examination.",

The temperature was approximately 83 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pilot noticed a reduced climb performance.  After a local flight of approximately 15 minutes, the pilot returned for a full stop landing.  He did not recheck the windsock, and elected to use runway 36.  During his landing attempt, the pilot noticed that the airplane \"wouldn't settle.\"  The pilot considered aborting the landing, but decided against it due to the airplane's position, and the reduced climb performance during the previous takeoff.  After touchdown, he retracted the wing flaps in order to obtain maximum braking performance.  However, this action also delayed brake application, since the airplane was only equipped with hand-activated brakes.  At approximately 30 mph, the pilot steered the airplane off the right side of the runway, in order to avoid running off the end and incurring more severe damage.  The airplane continued down an embankment, and was stopped by underbrush and trees approximately 250 feet beyond the runway.  According to an eyewitness, the airplane touched down on the last third of the runway, and the wind was from the south at the time of the event.",

A review of maintenance records revealed that the last recorded annual inspection was completed on March 21, 2004, at an airframe total time of 5,506.2 hours. On March 13, 1980, the FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive (AD) 80-05-05 addressing Schweizer Helicopters Model 269 series equipped with a tail boom center support (saddle) fitting certificated in all categories. The AD was issued to prevent fatigue failure of the tail boom center support fitting and the resultant loss of the tailboom. A review of the maintenance records dating back to March 13, 1980, found no logbook entries that indicated the required inspections outlined in the AD had been accomplished. Examination of the tail rotor assembly found the tailboom saddle attachment broken. Further examination found rubbing on the tailrotor drive shaft near the broken tailboom saddle attachment. Examination found that the tailboom support fitting fractured as a result of fatigue initiating at the base of a large corrosion pit on the tip surface of the forward wall. This surface, which was in direct contact with the tailboom, was only partially covered by paint, and contained extensive pitting damage. Following the fracture of the saddle support fitting the tailboom dropped and rubbed against the tail drive shaft fracturing it in overstress.",
            "probable_cause": "Fatigue failure of the tailboom saddle fitting which resulted in a loss of aircraft control.  Also causal was inadequate maintenance due to non-compliance to an airworthiness directive requiring inspection of the saddle fitting.  A contributing factor was the pilot's lack of proper certification."

The pilot passed away several months after the accident and was never able to provide a statement.  A witness, who saw the crash and responded to the site to render aid, asked the pilot what had happened.  The pilot told the witness that he was trying to land due to low fuel state.  First responders observed large amounts of fuel leaking out of the damaged wing tanks and from the lower forward fuselage where the header tanks and fuel lines are located.  Fuel was still leaking from the airplane when Safety Board investigators arrived 2 hours after the accident.  The airframe and engine were examined with no mechanical anomalies noted that would have precluded normal operation.  Investigators were not able to establish at what time the pilot departed from Compton or when the pilot had last refueled the airplane.  Investigators found that the alternator circuit breaker was tripped.  An alternator was found in the wreckage of the cabin and examination revealed that it had a shorted internal diode.  The alternator attached to the engine was missing the grounding post and the associated ground wire.  The ground strap between the engine and the airframe had been disconnected, with the disconnected end weathered and worn.  The airplane manufacturer's technical representative indicated that the fuel level for this airplane is sensed from a variable resistance float assembly that can indicate lower fuel levels than actual as the electrical system voltage drops.  Due to the poor condition of the alternator, it is highly likely that the battery was discharging and the voltage level dropping.  If that were the case, then the variable resistance float assembly for the fuel gage level would have started to show a lower than expected fuel level indication inside the cockpit leading the pilot to believe that the airplane was experiencing a low fuel state situation.  Only partial maintenance records were recovered and the recent maintenance that may have been performed, if any, on the electrical system could not be determined.",

The engine quit running, and the pilot selected an emergency landing area on a sand bar along a river that contained several willow trees.  During the landing, the airplane received damage to the wings and fuselage.  The engine had accrued 1,491 hours since an overhaul.  During that time, seven engine cylinder changes were performed by company maintenance personnel.  An examination of the engine revealed the crankshaft was broken along the aft, lower edge of the number two cheek journal, at the forward radius of the number two main bearing journal.  The fracture line was straight and flat, through the full dimension of the number two cheek journal, and was oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the crankshaft.

He said there were trees at the end of the runway, but he did not feel that he could have applied the brakes and stop the takeoff roll without running into them, so he continued the takeoff. The pilot further stated that he felt that the airplane's acceleration was being impeded by the cracks on the runway which had grass growing in them, so he decided to transition to a soft field takeoff. He said that initially the climbout was \"okay\", but the proximity and height of the trees required that he maintain approximately 60 knots, and at that airspeed the aircraft seemed less and less responsive. He said he attempted to lower the pitch to increase the airspeed a couple of times during the climbout, but the aircraft seemed less and less responsive.

The engine lost power, and the pilot performed an autorotation to a field. While maneuvering to land, he saw a barbed wire fence obstructing the intended landing area, so he maneuvered the helicopter to clear the fence. The helicopter subsequently cleared the fence and landed hard in a field. Engine examination revealed that the four axial compressor blades exhibited significant deformation on the outboard tips of their leading edges in the direction opposite of normal rotation consistent with the ingestion of soft body foreign object debris, such as ice. A subsequent engine run did not detect any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. For 3 days before the accident flight, the helicopter was parked outside without its engine cover installed and was exposed to light drizzle, rain, mist, and fog. The engine inlet cover was installed the day before the accident at an unknown time. The helicopter remained outside and exposed to freezing temperatures throughout the night until 2 hours before the flight. Although the helicopter was maintained in a ready status on the helipad and maintenance personnel performed daily preflight/airworthiness checks, the inlet to the first-stage of the axial compressor was not inspected to ensure that it was free of ice in accordance with the Aircraft Maintenance Manual. Based on the weather conditions that the helicopter was exposed to during the 3 days before the accident, it is likely that ice formed in the engine air inlet before the flight and that, when the pilot increased the engine power during takeoff, the accumulated ice separated from the inlet and was ingested by the engine and damaged the compressor blades.

As loaded, with full fuel and the pilot and three passengers aboard, the airplane was about 117 pounds below its maximum gross operating weight at takeoff. The pilot selected 10 degrees of flaps for takeoff; however, the owner's manual stated that normal and obstacle clearance takeoffs were to be performed with wing flaps retracted and specified the use of takeoff flaps only for soft or rough fields. Just after liftoff (the pilot estimated the altitude to be about 40 feet above the ground), the airspeed began to deteriorate and the stall warning sounded. Because of the row of trees off the end of the runway, the pilot could not land straight ahead, so he turned about 10 degrees left and aimed toward a shorter tree. The airplane\u2019s right main landing gear impacted the tree, and the pilot landed the airplane on a nearby road. During the landing roll, the left wing struck a tree, the airplane swerved to the left, and the nose landing gear sheared off before the airplane slid to a stop. Examination of the airplane and a postaccident engine run did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal engine operation. It is likely that the pilot\u2019s improper use of flaps during takeoff while operating near the airplane\u2019s maximum gross weight reduced the airplane\u2019s climb capability and it was unable to clear the trees off the end of the departure runway.

Immediately after the pilot discovered he had a problem with the engine, he turned toward the approach end of the field he had departed from in hopes of making a precautionary landing if necessary. As he headed back toward the airport, the aircraft continued to lose power, and it became apparent that he would not be able to stretch the glide far enough to land on the paved runway. Because the terrain between him and the runway was not suitable for landing and was crossed by power lines, and because the berm that ran along the side of the runway made it unsafe to land perpendicular to the runway, the pilot decided he would try to land parallel to the runway in a mowed grass area adjacent to it. Although he was able to stretch the glide to an extent that allowed him to reach the airport boundary, the aircraft had lost so much altitude that when he attempted to make the turn to parallel the runway, the aircraft's right wing tip impacted the terrain.

Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Georgia.  AirTran mechanics at ATL identified the source of the leak as a chafed hydraulic pressure line to the right thrust reverser.  They found the part in the illustrated parts catalog (IPC), which was not designed as a troubleshooting document and does not contain sufficient detail for such use.  One of the mechanics telephoned an AirTran maintenance controller in Orlando, Florida, for further instructions.  The mechanics who initially identified the source of the leak had little experience working on the Boeing 737 because they had worked for ValuJet Airlines, which flew DC-9s only, until ValuJet and AirTran merged in September 1997.  On the basis of the information provided by the mechanic, and without questioning his description of the line or verifying the part number that he had provided against the IPC or some other appropriate maintenance document, the maintenance controller instructed the mechanic to cap the leaking line and deactivate the right thrust reverser in accordance with AirTran's Minimum Equipment List procedures.  However, instead of capping the hydraulic pressure line, the mechanics capped the right engine hydraulic pump case drain return line.  The mechanics performed a leak check by starting the auxiliary power unit and turning on the electric hydraulic pumps to pressurize the airplane's hydraulic systems; no leaks were detected.  Although the mechanics were not required by company procedures to test their repair by running the engines, this test would have alerted the mechanics that they had incorrectly capped the hydraulic pump case drain line, which would have overpressurized the hydraulic pump and caused the hydraulic pump case seal to rupture.  However, because the mechanics did not perform this test, the overpressure and rupture occurred during the airplane's climb out, allowing depletion of system A hydraulic fluid.  Depletion of system A hydraulic fluid activated the hydraulic low-pressure lights in the cockpit, which alerted the flight crew that the airplane had a hydraulic problem.  The crew notified air traffic control that the airplane would be returning to ATL and subsequently declared an emergency.  The flight crew's initial approach to the airport was high and fast because of the workload associated with performing AirTran's procedures for the loss of hydraulic system A and the limited amount of time available to perform the procedures.  Nevertheless, the crew was able to configure and stabilize the airplane for landing.  However, depletion of system A hydraulic fluid disabled the nosewheel steering, inboard flight spoilers, ground spoilers, and left and right inboard brakes.  The flight crew was able to land the airplane using the left thrust reverser (the right thrust reverser was fully functional but intentionally deactivated by the mechanics), outboard brakes (powered by hydraulic system B), and rudder.  The flight crew used the left thrust reverser and rudder in an attempt to control the direction of the airplane down the runway, but use of the rudder pedals in this manner had depleted the system A accumulator pressure, which would have allowed three emergency brake applications.  The use of the right outboard brake without the right inboard brake at a higher-than-normal speed (Vref for 15-degree flaps is faster than Vref for normal landing flaps) and with heavy gross weight (the airplane had consumed only 4,650 pounds of the 28,500 pounds of fuel on board at takeoff) used up the remaining friction material on the right outboard brake, causing it to fail.  (The left outboard brake was still functional at this point.)  The lack of brake friction material on the right outboard brake caused one of the right outboard brake pistons to overtravel and unport its o-ring, allowing system B hydraulic fluid to leak out; as a result, the left outboard brake also failed.  Loss of the left and right inboard and outboard brakes, loss of nosewheel steering, and use of asymmetric thrust reverse caused the flight crew to lose control of the airplane, which departed the left side of the runway and came to rest in a ditch.   ",
            "probable_cause": "(1) the capping of the incorrect hydraulic line by mechanics, which led to the failure of hydraulic system A; (2) the mechanics' lack of experience working with the Boeing 737 hydraulic system; and (3) the maintenance controller's failure to ascertain more information regarding the leaking hydraulic line before instructing the mechanics to cap the line and deactivate the right thrust reverser.  Contributing to the cause of the accident were (1) the asymmetric directional control resulting from the deactivation of the right thrust reverser; (2) the depletion of the left and right inboard brake accumulator pressure because of the flight crew's use of the rudder pedals with only the left thrust reverser to control the direction of the airplane down the runway; (3) the failure of the right outboard brake because the airplane was slowed without the use of the left and right inboard brakes and was traveling at a higher-than-normal speed and with heavy gross weight; (4) the failure of the right outboard brake after one of the right outboard pistons overtraveled and unported its o-ring, allowing system B hydraulic fluid to deplete and the left outboard brake to fail; and (5) the mechanics' improper use of the illustrated parts catalog for maintenance and troubleshooting and the maintenance controller's failure to use the appropriate documents for maintenance and troubleshooting.

No record was found indicating the pilot obtained a weather briefing before departure.  The pilot had a choice of taking either a direct route that crossed a remote area of rugged mountainous terrain with maximum ground elevations of about 9,000 feet or a route that was about 10 minutes longer and followed an interstate highway with maximum ground elevations of about 6,000 feet.  After takeoff, the pilot reported his departure to the Elko county dispatch center, stating that his estimated time en route was l hour 20 minutes.  There were no further radio communications from the helicopter.  Radar data, which show about 4 minutes of the helicopter's flight before coverage was lost due to mountainous terrain, are consistent with the flight following the direct route.  A search was initiated about 4 hours after the helicopter did not arrive at the destination hospital, and the wreckage was located the following morning.  The accident site was along the direct course line at an elevation of about 8,600 feet. Physical evidence observed at the accident site indicated that the helicopter was in level flight at impact and was consistent with controlled flight into terrain. No evidence was found of any preimpact mechanical discrepancies with the helicopter's airframe or systems that would have prevented normal operation.  Rotational damage to the rotor blades and transmission components were consistent with normal engine operation at impact.  The two closest aviation weather reporting stations, located 31 and 54 nautical miles (nm) from the accident site, both reported 10 miles visibility, clear skies below 12,000 feet, and no precipitation at the time of the accident.  However, satellite images valid approximately 1 hour before the accident indicated cloud cover over the accident site.  Additionally, weather radar images valid approximately 1.5 hours before the accident indicated light precipitation was present in the vicinity of the accident site.  However, the exact weather conditions and cloud ceiling at the time and location of the accident could not be determined.  If the pilot had obtained a weather briefing, he would likely have learned of the cloud cover and light precipitation present along his planned route of flight.  Studies conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board and industry have shown that the urgent nature of the EMS mission can result in inaccurate/incomplete preflight planning, as well as poor pilot judgment.  The fact that the patient was an infant may well have placed additional pressure on the pilot to take the direct route to arrive at the hospital sooner.  The helicopter was not equipped with an enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS), and none as required.  If installed, an EGPWS would have alerted the pilot of high terrain ahead at least 35seconds before impact.  Although the search for the helicopter was not initiated until about 4 hours after the accident (despite company flight-following procedures that indicated an aircraft should be reported missing as soon as it fails to make a required 15-minute position report), this accident was not survivable and a faster notification would not have changed the outcome.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from mountainous terrain. Contributing factors were the pilot's improper decision to take the direct route over mountainous terrain, the dark night conditions, and the pressure to complete the mission induced by the pilot as a result of the nature of the EMS mission."

The private pilot received minor injuries. The flight departed from Donegal Springs Airpark (N71) Marietta, Pennsylvania, about 1405, destined for Upshur County Regional Airport (W22), Buckhannon, West Virginia. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, he departed N71, around 1405. About 10 miles from W22, the pilot called in on the UNICOM frequency, and verified the weather conditions. He was advised that there was no aircraft in the traffic pattern, so he opted for a straight in approach to runway 29.About 5 miles from touchdown, he was at an approach speed of approximately 100 knots indicated airspeed. He performed his prelanding checklist. Both fuel tanks had approximately 25 gallons of fuel in them and he verified that the fuel selector was on fullest tank. He verified that the fuel boost pump was on, lowered the wing flaps to 50 percent, and set the mixture to about 60 percent. He then made a final approach call around 4 miles from touchdown, and verified the airport conditions on UNICOM once again.Approximately 3 miles from the threshold of runway 29, at 400 to 500 feet above ground level, he increased throttle to compensate for the normal airspeed loss on final approach.  To his surprise, nothing happened. He was expecting to hear a pitch change, feel a subtle change in vibration, and see his airspeed stabilize but, none of those events occurred.He moved his hand in a manner to manipulate both throttle and mixture at the same time and increased both to maximum. Again, no response in engine noise, vibration, or gain in airspeed occurred.By now the indicated airspeed had decayed to below 80 knots. Knowing that he was just at, or just below, the published minimums for the CAPS, without hesitation he reached for the red handle with my right hand while maintaining control of the airplane with his left hand as he deployed the CAPS and transmitted a \"Mayday\" call over the radio. After the CAPS was deployed, all he had time to do was to tighten his restraint prior to impact. After impact he shutdown the airplane's systems, and exited the airplane.Postaccident examination of the accident site and airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector revealed that during the impact sequence, the airplane first struck a pickup truck, then terrain, and sustained substantial damage prior to coming to rest. The left main landing gear had penetrated the bottom of the left wing and left main fuel tank, the nose landing gear had separated from the airplane, two of the blades on the four-bladed propeller were bent back, the right wing flap was bent back on the outboard portion, and the fuselage was damaged from the CAPS deployment.The wreckage was retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

No physical evidence of bird ingestion was found in either engine.  A CVR sound spectrum plot and a flight profile analysis revealed that one engine flamed out almost immediately after the sound of a \"thump\" on the CVR.  The other engine's speed decreased and experienced stalls until the engine speed was reduced to flight idle.  The original engine certification tests indicated that compressor stalls occurred when a 2-4 ounce starling was shot ingested into the engine, but physical damage from bird ingestion was very slight due to the all steel construction and geometry of the engine.

One internal baffle cone was found separated from the end plate and was blocking the opening of the muffler. Upon shaking the muffler, the baffle cone was free to move around within the muffler assembly. The other baffle cone had a hole eroded in its center. Internal engine failures can cause partial or complete engine power loss by restricting the flow of the exhaust gases. If pieces of the internal baffling break loose and partially or totally block the flow of exhaust gases, an engine failure can occur. It is likely the exhaust gas was partially or totally blocked by the separated baffle cone during the flight, which resulted in a loss of engine power.",
            "probable_cause": "The separation of the end baffle cone inside the muffler, which blocked airflow through the engine after takeoff and resulted in a loss of engine power and an off-airport landing into obstacles."
