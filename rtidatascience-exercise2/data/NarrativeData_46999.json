The pilot reported emergency fuel status prior to the accident.  The sole occupant pilot aboard was killed and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and postcrash fire. The weather at the time of the accident was high winds, snow, and visibility of one-half mile.  The investigation revealed no evidence of any failure or anomaly of the airplane's powerplants, structures, or systems (including the fuel system). There was no evidence of pilot fatigue or physiological issues.  Prior to the accident flight, the pilot participated in a mission briefing which included weather forecast conditions for the day.  Although the forecast was calling for snow and low visibility later in the day, there were no forecast conditions below the required minima for the time period of the mission.  As the accident pilot prepared for takeoff, he noted conditions were lower than forecast for that time and twice contacted the base weather observer for an update.  While it is unknown if any of the mission pilots received updated weather, no other mission pilots cancelled due to weather.  Therefore, the pilot was aware that conditions were deteriorating faster than forecast and took appropriate action to obtain updated information.  None of the forecast weather was below required minima that would have required him to cancel the flight.As the mission airplanes began returning to NFL following the termination of the exercise due to the weather, the ATC approach controller rapidly became saturated sequencing and separating the airplanes.  At the same time, the PAR controller incorrectly set up the precision approach radar as the accident airplane was being vectored to the approach course, which resulted in the accident airplane being vectored off the precision approach.  Additionally, the approach controller was saturated and did not efficiently sequence and vector the other returning airplanes, resulting in the accident airplane flying an extended pattern more than 20 miles longer than usual.  On the second PAR approach attempt, the accident pilot initiated and executed a missed approach for unspecified reasons, but all ATC directions appeared to be appropriate. After the pilot requested to divert to RNO due to low fuel, the approach controller did not relay that the RNO weather was below minimums, which likely resulted in unnecessary fuel burn from the diversion.  Therefore, ATC handling of the accident airplane was deficient, and resulted in 30 miles or more of excess flying distance.  Although the reason that the accident pilot abandoned the second approach is not known, the relatively strong winds and low ceilings required would have required a significant amount of attention by the pilot.  Review of ATAC training records indicated that the pilot may not have had sufficient currency or proficiency under instrument conditions in the Kfir. Additionally, since most of the pilots experience was in the F/A-18, his lack of instrument experience in the Kfir may not have taken into account the airplanes less sophisticated instrumentation and limited fuel endurance compared to the F/A-18 in his decision making before and during the exercise. During the pilots final attempt to land at NFL it was clear he was aware of his critical fuel status.  Review of radar data shows that the accident airplane was roughly aligned for an emergency straight-in approach to runway 7, however, ATC did not relay this option.  The pilot elected to make a low altitude approach, first to runway 31L, then when he became misaligned to that runway, transition to a low altitude modified right downwind approach to runway 13R.  The airplane then appeared to turn towards taxiway A at about the time the engine flamed out and subsequently impacted the bunker.  Examination of the ejection seat concluded that the firing mechanism had not been activated.  Although the pilot was aware of his critical fuel state, he elected to attempt a low altitude hazardous maneuver instead of proceeding toward the nearby dry lake bed and ejecting.  It is possible that the pilot did not eject because he was concerned about the effects of the high surface winds on a deployed parachute.The pilot's decision making in this accident is a possible indicator of a mindset to complete the assigned mission.  On May 18, 2012 another ATAC fighter crashed, fatally injuring the pilot.  In that accident the pilot was also likely pressing to complete the mission, leading eventually to the accident.  ATAC did not have a crew resource management or safety-risk management program in place for its pilots at the time of these accidents; therefore, it is likely that the pilot's training did not support good aeronautical decision-making concepts.  Following a recommendation in a Navy audit in June, 2012, Crew Resource Management training was established. Additionally, since the flight was operating under Public Aircraft Operations the Navy was responsible for oversight of the company.  The Navy contract, while setting some requirements for FAA certifications, did not specify to what FAA standards the airplane, pilots, or training were required to conform (such as instrument currency or pilot proficiency). Thus, the oversight environment did not include controls or standards that would be expected in other U.S. commercial aviation operations. ",
            "probable_cause": "fuel exhaustion following missed approaches due to deficient ATC handling under weather conditions which were significantly lower than forecast.  The second missed approach may have been initiated due to limited pilot instrument proficiency.Contributing to the severity of the accident was the pilot's decision to attempt an emergency landing in low visibility instead of ejecting when fuel exhaustion was imminent.  Also contributing to the accident was an organizational and oversight environment which did not require airman, aircraft, or risk management controls or standards expected of a commercial civil aviation operation."

Prior to takeoff, the pilot selected takeoff flaps and takeoff trim.  During the takeoff roll, the pilot felt the airplane was not accelerating normally, but attributed it to summer temperatures.  About 1,000 feet down the runway, the airplane broke ground briefly, then settled back down and became airborne again in about 100 feet.  After the pilot subsequently \"got it off the ground,\" he felt that it was not accelerating normally, so he pushed the yoke forward and raised the flaps.

The emergency procedures section of the flight manual states that in the event of an engine failure or low rpm, a red light will illuminate and an audio signal will sound when the audio switch is in the AUDIO position. The flight manual instructs the pilot to immediately execute an autorotative descent. The pilot released the water, and made a left-pedal turn to exit the canyon and move away from the fire. He checked his engine rotor rpm gauge and saw that the needles had split: the rotor needle was at the 4-5 o'clock position, and the engine needle was at the 6-o'clock position, which he stated indicated maximum rpm. He maneuvered to establish an autorotation into a landing zone. The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the airframe and tail boom as the result of a hard landing, which collapsed the landing skid. Postaccident examination discovered that the N2 tachometer drive shaft was sheered as a result of torsional overstress.

Maintenance personnel checked the airplane, and after the maintenance was performed it was revealed that the chip detector was found to have some fuzz on the probe.  The engine was run, all checks of the engine were normal, and the aircraft was placed back into service.  Just after takeoff, on the second mission, the pilot of N474AW reported to the pilot of the lead aircraft, that he was having problems, that he had lost power on No. 2 engine (right), that he could not maintain altitude and said, \"it's going in with me.\"  The lead pilot saw him eject from the aircraft, witnessed the fireball as the aircraft impacted in rising terrain, and saw the parachute open, but no seat separation.  The pilot of N474AW said, \"...the first indication that [he] got was that I felt the airplane start to yaw a little bit...[the] right engine was starting to spool down...[he] reached up and hit the hydraulic dump, to dump the [internal] load.\"  He did not dump the external wing tanks, as is called for in the emergency engine failure checklist.  He said \"...[he] could [not] get the prop to feather...it was still slowly dying and it wasn't just a catastrophic failure...it was just like it was a slow dying process...and the airplane wouldn't climb...and the prop still wasn't in the feather...I was still flying into what I believed to be rising terrain I couldn't gain any altitude...I determined that I wasn't going to make it, that the airplane was going to wind up in [a] ditch.  The pilot described checks he performed on the right engine, but did not mention anything about adding power to the left engine, as called for in item number one of the emergency engine failure check list.  The pilot then elected to eject from the airplane.  The maximum gross weight for the accident aircraft was 15,000 pounds.   On the accident flight the calculated gross weight was 15,500 pounds.  After dumping the internal load the calculated weight at impact was 13,056 pounds.  According to item # 3, of the engine failure checklist, \"External stores and Hooper load...JETTISON, AS REQUIRED.\"  The external load was not jettisoned.  Teardown and examinations of both engines and both propellers did not reveal any discrepancies.  The calculated density altitude (DA) at the time of the accident was 2,540 feet.  A simulated flight in an OV-10D was conducted, in an attempt to duplicate the accident flight.  In the opinion of the two pilots that performed the tests, \"...It is very possible...an OV-10 configured similarly as [the test airplane]...could perform safely and accomplish a climb if appropriate emergency procedures [as] outlined in [the] OV-10...Pilot's Pocket Checklist are employed...if the same procedures are followed in the checklist...regarding jettison of 'external stores and hopper load, drag index would be reduced to 50.  With reduced drag index, performance would exponentially increase.\" ",

According to the operator's records, when the airplane departed from Ukiah, its gross takeoff weight was about 5,909 pounds.  The pilot operating handbook (POH) for the airplane lists the following items in the single engine go around checklist:  1) Throttle full forward; 2) wing flaps up; 3) when positive climb rate achieved, gear up; 4) ensure the inoperative engine is feathered.  For a gross weight of 5,900 pounds, and the existing atmospheric conditions, the single engine climb performance chart shows an expected positive rate of climb of 500 feet per minute if the airplane was configured correctly.  The chart also lists the following subtractions from that performance for the listed condition:  1) -400 fpm for wind milling inoperative engine; 2) -350 feet for landing gear down; 3) -200 fpm for flaps extended to 15 degrees.   Examination of the wreckage disclosed that neither engine's propeller was feathered, the landing gear was down and the flaps were extended to 10 degrees.  Without the airplane configured correctly for the single engine missed approach, the net climb performance would be a negative 400 feet per minute.  There were no discrepancies noted with the airframe examination.  The engine examination revealed no mechanical anomalies with either engine that would have precluded normal operation.  14 CFR 135.224 states that a pilot cannot initiate an approach if the weather conditions are below landing minimums if the approach is started outside of the final approach fix.  The pilot can continue the landing if they are already established on the approach and the airport goes below landing minimums.  According to the operator's FAA approved operating specifications, the operator had not been approved for lower than standard landing minimums.",
            "probable_cause": "loss of engine power in the left engine for undetermined reasons.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to correctly configure the airplane for a single engine missed approach, which resulted in a negative climb performance.  A factor was the pilot's decision to initiate the approach when the weather conditions were below the published approach minimums."

The Captain remembered that as the nose of the aircraft was lowering prior to the second touchdown, he may have pulled back on his side stick controller slightly to prevent the nose gear from striking the runway at too great a speed.  After the aircraft touched down a second time the tailstrike occurred.  Information extracted from the aircraft's flight data recorder revealed that both side stick controllers were activated simultaneously during the tailstrike.  According to the manufacturer, when both side stick controllers are activated simultaneously (at least 2 degrees deflection off the neutral position) in the same or opposite directions and neither pilot takes priority via the takeover push button, the system adds the signals of both pilots algebraically.   Airbus had issued Flight Crew Operating bulletins concerning bounced landings and tailstrikes but the pilots stated that no classroom or simulator training was received to reinforce the meaning and contents of the bulletins.",
            "probable_cause": "Following a bounced landing, the pilot in command activated his sidestick controller while the first officer was in control of the airplane, which subsequently resulted in the overcontrol of pitch and a tailstrike.  Contributing to the circumstances of this accident were the pilot-in-command's failure to properly activate his sidestick takeover push button prior to his remedial action, and the operator's insufficient emphasis on bounced landing recovery techniques and tailstrike avoidance procedures."

However, instrument meteorological conditions were reported near the accident site. The flight originated from Red Eagle Aviation (S27), Kalispell, Montana, at about 1415 mountain standard time, with an intended destination of Lynden Airport, Lynden, Washington. On July 11, 2015, an Alert Notification (ALNOT) was issued for the accident aircraft.  On July 13, 2015, a survivor was located on Highway 20 near Easy Pass Head Trail, Skagit County, Washington. In a verbal statement provided to Okanogan County Sheriff's Department, she reported that she was flying home from Montana with her grandparents. The airplane flew into clouds and the pilot was using a GPS to navigate with. When the airplane exited the clouds, she could see the mountain in front of the airplane. In an attempt to gain the altitude, the pilot pulled back on the yoke but he was unsuccessful. The airplane impacted terrain, and a post-accident fire ensued. The survivor attempted to extract  the pilot and the other passenger from the wreckage, but  was unsuccessful.",

After release, the pilot attempted to find areas of lift around the Coburg Hills, and then started back toward the airport with the intention of being at least 3,000 feet agl when she  arrived at the northern edge of Springfield, Oregon (about seven miles north of the airport). But, as the pilot flew south toward Springfield, she encountered a considerable amount of descending air, and the aircraft was down to about 2,400 feet agl when it arrived over the northern portion of Springfield. The pilot then continued to the south, and attempted to find ascending air around Pisgah Mountain, but was unable to do so. She then proceeded further south to Short Mountain (about one mile east of the accident site), and again tried to locate an ascending air mass, but was again unsuccessful. Soon thereafter she decided to discontinue her attempt to continue to Hobby Field, and instead set up for a landing in a nearby open field. The field she chose was about three miles north of Hobby Field, and covered with very tall grass/grain. As she approached the field from the north, she realized that the aircraft's ground speed was higher than it would normally be during an approach for landing because it was at that time experiencing a tailwind of 10 or more knots. She therefore decided to attempt to turn back into the wind prior to touching down in the field. During that turn the pilot allowed the aircraft's left wing to get caught in the tall grass, and it did a one-quarter cartwheel into the terrain.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the terrain while attempting to maneuver the aircraft into the wind during an off-airport landing in an open field. Factors include the pilot's inadequate in flight planning,  tailwind conditions during an attempted turn from downwind to base, and tall vegetation in the area that the pilot found it necessary to land in."

Upon further examination, debris was discovered in the fuel tank, and large sections of a material were peeling from the fuel tank walls. In addition, there were rusty areas in the fuel tank. The fuel tank outlet did not contain a fuel screen for fuel to travel through when exiting the tank.Maintenance records indicated that in April 1990, the accident airplane had undergone major repairs and alterations, which included sealing of the fuel tank with a sloshing sealer, use of which was approved at the time. However, in 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration released a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin stating that over time, that sloshing sealer could deteriorate and peel from the internal wall of the fuel tank. Pieces of the sealer could then block the fuel tank outlet, potentially starving the engine of fuel. It was not possible to determine to what extent maintenance personnel examined the fuel tank during the most recent annual inspection, which was completed in September 2012.

This was first discovered when the landing gear hesitated before extending. To extend the landing gear during subsequent flights, the pilot shut off all nonessential electrical equipment in the airplane, extended the landing gear, and then turned the electrical equipment back on. On the morning of the accident, while on approach at the destination airport, the electrical system failed and the landing gear would not extend. The pilot reached behind his seat, \"jiggled\" the airplane's battery cables, and was able to restore electricity and extend the landing gear. He landed the airplane uneventfully and shut the airplane down. After shutdown, the airplane had to be \"hand propped\" to be restarted; however, the pilot could not adjust the electrically-controlled propeller to the proper pitch for takeoff. The pilot removed the battery from his airplane and returned to his home airport with another pilot. He charged two batteries and returned with the charged batteries to his airplane. The pilot installed one of the batteries in his airplane and stated that if he could get the airplane started, he would fly it back to his home airport with the landing gear down. The airplane started after three attempts, and the pilot taxied to the runway. A witness observed fuel exiting the right wingtip fuel vent during taxi, indicating that there was fuel in the main wing tanks. The pilot departed, and while he was en route, he transmitted that he was experiencing a problem and that he was going to land in a field. A witness observed the airplane at low altitude but did not hear any engine noise as the airplane passed him. The airplane then maneuvered around a barn and touched down in a level attitude in a harvested corn field. The airplane\u2019s landing gear collapsed, and the airplane nosed over. Examination of the airplane and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction; however, examination of the propeller indicated that the engine was not producing power, and the header tank, which supplied fuel to the engine, contained only 8 ounces of fuel. The inline fuel filter and fuel strainer contained only trace amounts of fuel. Further examination revealed that the header tank received its fuel from the wing tanks via electrically-operated transfer pumps. Examination of a connector that connected the positive battery cable to the master relay revealed that the inside of the connector's collar, which had been soldered and crimped onto the battery cable, was moist and heavily corroded, and that not all of the battery cable's wire strands were in contact with the collar of the connector. Further examination revealed that the end of battery cable that had been retained by the connector's collar was also moist and exhibited significant corrosion, indicating that the connector had been exposed to a corrosive environment. Examination of the battery box revealed corrosion and electrolyte (sulfuric acid) residue, which indicated that a release of electrolyte from a previously-installed battery had occurred. Additionally, comparison of the position of the positive battery cable's run from the battery terminal to the master contactor revealed that the master contactor was mounted below the top of the battery and that no precautions had been taken to prevent liquid from running down the cable into the base of the connector. With a failure of the electrical wiring interconnect, the airplane\u2019s battery was unable to power the electrical system. Because the fuel transfer pumps were electrically powered, fuel was not transferred to the header tank to feed the engine, and a loss of engine power occurred. Additionally, without electrical power, the propeller could not be adjusted and the electrically-actuated landing gear could not be retracted to reduce drag and extend the airplane\u2019s glide. Further, because the wing flaps were electrically operated, they could not be extended during the landing, thus the airplane touched down at a higher speed (13 or more knots) than normal touchdown speed, which reduced the survivability of the accident when the airplane nosed over.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's decision to operate the airplane with known electrical system problems, which resulted in the in-flight failure of the electrical wiring interconnect system, loss of electrical power, and subsequent fuel starvation and loss of engine power."

The pilot reported he was 7 or 8 miles from the airport at 8,500 feet msl, and was inbound for landing.  The controller asked the pilot if he would be able to descend from his position.  The pilot answered, \"Yeah, if I could do right traffic, I'll go into a imitation of a rock, see what I can do.\"  The controller told the pilot to enter a left downwind leg at a midfield position, and issued the wind conditions, which were reported as 270 degrees at 25 knots.  Several witnesses, within a mile of the accident site, reported seeing the airplane as being in a steep, nose down attitude at a rapidly increasing rate of descent.

He said,\" that if you do reduce power, the airplane will fall off wrong and you will not have enough altitude to recover.\" Examination of recorded video/images taken of the flight sequence through the ground impact showed the airplane come out of the torque roll into an inverted spin with full left rudder and slight upward elevator controls.  The airplane descends in an inverted spin attitude for 3 revolutions before the airplane makes a clockwise roll around its longitudinal axis, placing it in an upright, nose down attitude.  About 3.4 seconds prior to the airplane coming out of the inverted attitude, the rudder moves toward neutral.  The airplane enters a left downward spiral.  At this point, the airplane is less than 600 feet agl.  The airplane makes 1.5 left-turning spirals.  On completion of the first spiral, the rudder is deflected left and the elevator is deflected upward.  At the end of 1.5 spirals, the airplane is approximately 150 feet agl.  At this point, the airplane stops its spiral motion and falls straight down to the ground in a 47-degree nose down pitch attitude.  On impact, the airplane's rudder shows full right deflection.  The elevator is full up (full aft stick deflection).",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control resulting in the inverted spin, spiral, and subsequent impact with terrain.  Factors contributing to the accident were the inadvertent stall spin, the spiral, low altitude, and the pilot's delayed attempt to recover from the spin and spiral."

Two witnesses reported that the airplane's engine did not sound right during the takeoff and the ground roll was longer than normal. Just beyond the runway, the airplane turned slightly left and then impacted the top of several trees. Both wings separated and remained lodged in the treetops; first responders noted fuel running from the wings. The emergency locater transmitter (ELT) was in found in the off position. Examination of the engine revealed water and contaminants in the fuel system, especially in the injection servo and fuel pump, which would have resulted in the rough-running engine and loss of engine power. A review of the airplane's maintenance records did not reveal any entries since the pilot had purchased the airplane. The airplane's last maintenance entry was at the annual inspection, which was about the time the airplane was purchased. The entry stated \"found water in tanks - sumped tanks, cleaned flow divider, fuel screens and lines.\"  The log also had the entry that stated \"c/w FAR 91.207 ELT insp by installing new batteries, due March 2017.\" The airport manager had witnessed the same pilot depart in the accident airplane about a month earlier; however, the airplane's engine did not sound right, and the pilot returned to the airport. A review of the pilot's logbook revealed an entry \"aborted X-country, lost engine power, so landed\" on that date. About 2 weeks later, an e-mail from the pilot to family members stated that a clogged fuel injection system was found after the aborted flight. Two days after that, the pilot's logbook reflected 1.1 flight hours with a note that stated \"test flight, perfect.\" On that same date, the pilot wrote a check to a maintenance company at the airport on which the airplane's registration number and \"Maint\" were written in the memo field.

During the impact sequence, the pilot likely rotated about his lap belt, braced himself with his arms and fractured his shoulders, but his head struck the instrument panel, resulting in his fatal skull injury.

The flight instructor stated that he had the student do a practice single engine VOR approach to the airport in VFR conditions.  The right engine was set to zero thrust for the procedure and the winds were straight down runway 29.  They overflew the runway during the approach and circled to enter right traffic.  During the approach he had decided to have the student do a single engine go-around.  He stated that in hindsight he issued the go-around command at too low an altitude.  The airspeed was above Vmc during the go-around; however, due to the low altitude at maneuver initiation, the airplane inadvertently touched down with full power on the left engine, causing the airplane to begin veering to the right.  It became airborne again in a nose high, yawing, and right rolling attitude.  At this point, he assumed the controls and reduced the power on the left engine.  The airplane then settled to the ground in the nose high, yawed, and banked attitude with the right main gear off the pavement.  The right main gear and nose gear collapsed.  The instructor said that after thinking about the event, he believes that neither he nor the student were making aggressive enough control inputs to correct the situation in the early stages, and he may have waited too long before assuming control.

The helicopter collided with trees and then the ground and came to rest on its right side. A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the engine\u2019s antivibration snubbers were fractured. Subsequent examination of the snubbers revealed that the vibration reported by the pilot was likely due to a fracture of the lateral snubber assembly\u2019s vibration mount outboard of the mounting plate. The location of the fracture combined with the deformed outboard edge of the circumferential band indicate that the lateral snubber assembly moved both outboard and inboard relative to the mounting plate and, thus, that the fracture likely did not result from motion in one direction when the helicopter came to rest on its side. Additionally, dark red oxide was found on the steel surfaces that should have been encapsulated by elastomer, which indicates that relatively long-term oxidation of the surfaces had occurred due to environmental exposure. Further, areas of the lateral snubber vibration mount were separated from the elastomer, and only a little elastomer was adhered to the surface. The oxidation and lack of adhered elastomer suggest that preexisting cracks were present at or near the interface between the elastomer and the mounting plate. Circumferential cracks with a slight opening displacement were also observed at the inboard face of the elastomer, indicating that the elastomer was degraded. \u000b\u000bAccording to the helicopter manufacturer, specific inspections of the vibration mount assemblies are required at 50- and 100-hour intervals. An annual/100-hour inspection of the airframe and engine was completed about 6 weeks before the accident; the engine had operated about 18 hours since the inspection. The mechanic who performed the inspection stated that the snubber assemblies appeared airworthy at the time of the inspection.

The pilot autorotated to a forced landing.  During the descent over mountainous terrain, the helicopter collided with trees and impacted hard terrain on its left side which crushed inward.  The operator's policy required all crewmembers to wear helmets during flight.  Helmets were not provided for the two paramedics.  During the crash sequence, the passenger seat stanchions and tubing buckled, which resulted in multiple lap belt anchor point separations and the catapulting of crewmembers into the overhead cockpit panel.  Safety Board survival factors documentation in conjunction with helmet crashworthiness analysis revealed helicopter impact forces were within human tolerance.  The lack of and/or inadequate strength helmets and the lap belt anchor point failures allowed crewmembers' excursions resulting in head trauma.  The tail rotor component separations in flight resulted from a fatigue crack originating in the surface of the yoke onto which the tail rotor blades had been attached.  In 1996, Bell issued an Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) number 205-96-68, which was designed to measure yoke deformation resulting from adverse in-flight or ground handling operations which imposed excessive bending loads.  The test protocol was found problematic in its accuracy due to technical errors in the bulletin and a lack of clarity.  City mechanics failed to adhere to all of the ASB's requirements.  The bent yoke fractured at a total time in service of approximately 4,113 hours, about 117 hours after its inspection for evidence of deformation.  The yoke's stainless steel composition and requisite metallurgical properties were confirmed by the Safety Board.  An x-ray diffraction examination of the yoke revealed reduced compressive residual stress in the fracture origin region which allowed operational loads to initiate and propagate the fatigue crack.  This significant reduction of the residual stress was likely due to excessive flexure (bending) of the yoke.  The initiating event which overstressed and bent the yoke was not identified.",
            "probable_cause": "An excessive bending load applied to the tail rotor blade assembly of an undetermined origin which produced a fatigue crack, the separation of the assembly, and a forced landing.  Factors were the lack of suitable terrain to perform a forced landing, the manufacturer's unclear maintenance bulletin instruction and procedures which facilitated the operator's inadequate inspection for the yoke's straightness, and the inadequacy of restraint systems and protective equipment."

The pilot-rated passenger was handling the airplane controls, and 1 hour after takeoff, having performed a series of uneventful laps, the pilot and passenger decided to return for landing. The passenger applied full forward throttle control to initiate a climb, but the engine lost all power. The airplane immediately began to descend, and the pilot took over the flight controls, released the banner, and performed a forced landing into the water.The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage as it struck the water, separating the right main landing gear from the airframe. The separation of the right main landing gear meant that the airplane most likely came to rest right-wing-low on the sea bed. Due to the design of the fuel tanks\u2019 interconnecting vent lines and the inclusion of a vent port on the left tank only, fuel most likely either un-ported from the left tank while in the water, or transferred between tanks after recovery. As a result, an accurate determination of the fuel tank quantities could not be determined. The pilot and passenger reported that the fuel selector valve was in the \u201cBOTH\u201d position throughout the flight, however it was found in the \u201cRIGHT\u201d tank position after the accident. The location of the valve was such that it was most likely inadvertently kicked to this position as the passenger egressed from the airplane as it was sinking.Postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot did not use carburetor heat before the accident. While the temperature and dew point were conducive to carburetor icing at the engine\u2019s operating power level, the investigation could not conclusively determine that carburetor ice caused the loss of engine power.",

That discovery was reported via email to the NTSB's Northwest Regional Office. It was later determined that a fatigue crack had initiated at a rivet hole on the horizontal surface of the right wing lower spar cap, and propagated through approximately 80 percent of that surface. The NTSB materials laboratory determined that there was no evidence of inclusions, discontinuities, corrosion pitting, or material defects at the crack origins. All dimensional measurements were within engineering drawing specifications, and hardness and conductivity parameters for the aluminum alloy specified for the wing spar cap material were within material tolerances. During the investigation it was determined that at the time the crack was detected, the aircraft had flown 5,273 hours. Of that total time, approximately 1,100 hours were flown as part of a low-level pipeline patrol mission. It was further determined that as part of the certification process, Piper Aircraft had determined that the \"general use\" safe time in service (TIS), adjusted with a scatter pattern of eight, was 10,723 hours for the wing structure. The certification process did not include determination of a safe time in service when any portion of the aircraft's life included being used in a \"pipeline survey\" mission profile.

The Fenestron (tail rotor) assembly separated from the tail boom when it struck the wire and the helicopter subsequently entered an uncontrolled descent.  The main helicopter body impacted a single-family residence located near the shoreline and came to rest on the ground next to the home.  The pilot and pilot-rated passenger sustained fatal injuries.  One person in the residence sustained minor injuries.  Witnesses at several locations along the flight path reported a low-flying helicopter matching the description of the accident aircraft.  One witness noted that it was \"very fast\" and at or below the top of their 70-foot high silos.  Two witnesses to the accident sequence reported that they were in a boat on the lake and that they saw the helicopter descend toward their position.  One of them noted that the aircraft's flight path was \"very direct\" and that it was not \"wavering.\"  As the helicopter passed overhead, they recalled components coming off the aircraft.  They both stated that when they looked back the power lines were \"bouncing.\"  A third witness reported that she saw the helicopter dip low toward the water and then come back up toward the power lines.  She saw the tail separate from the helicopter and the aircraft went over trees on the opposite side of the lake from her position.  The power company reported that power was automatically interrupted in the area at the time of the accident.  Technicians dispatched to the site reported that one of the static wires was wrapped around a transmission line.

The pilot reduced collective and entered an autorotation, but had to turn downwind to clear trees.

The nut and washer for securing the adjustable control rod to the governor control lever were found in the bottom of the engine compartment, but the cotter pin specified for safetying the nut and washer was not located.

The pilot circled the grass strip 4 times and made a low pass over the strip. He then turned the airplane back towards the field, and the airplane was observed to stall. It crashed nose first into the terrain. According to the owner, the engine was still running when they arrived at the scene. About three months before the accident, the pilot had applied for a 2nd class medical certificate, which was denied because he was confused, forgetful, and evasive. Investigation revealed that at the time of the accident, the pilot had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and kidney failure for which he was receiving hemodialysis three days a week. In February 1993, the pilot was admitted to a hospital with a left parietal intracerebral hemarrhage (stroke) and seizures, and in January 1996, he was on three anti-seizure medications. The pilot did not report these conditions to the FAA. ",

The 1,050-hour pilot was attempting to maneuver the airplane using partial panel techniques.  Radar data showed that the pilot appeared to be experiencing spatial disorientation.  ATC controllers were alerted due to the fact that the airplane was making \"left' turns\" instead of right turns as advised.  After being observed by several witnesses flying just below the lowest cloud layer (approximately 125 feet agl) the airplane impacted several homes in a residential neighborhood.  Both homes and the airplane were destroyed by post-impact fire.  One person who was located 1/2 miles from the accident site, witnessed the airplane flying overhead in an straight and level attitude approximately 125 feet above ground level (agl), slightly below a layer of clouds.  Another person who was a private pilot and located about 1/2 miles from the accident site, stated that he heard an airplane engine that sounded \"normal.\"  After about 15 seconds, it sounded as if the airplane was maneuvering, because of the pitch change in the engine.  According to this witness, the engine sounded like it was \"making good power.\"  The airplane was rapidly getting closer and sounded very low and fast.  The witness stated, \"at no time did I see the aircraft due to the weather conditions.\"  The nearest automated surface observing station reported wind from 130 degrees at 6 knots, visibility 7/8 in mist, overcast at 100 feet.  The temperature and dew point were reported as 17 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.20 inches of Mercury.  Flight control continuity could not be verified due to impact damage. A fire extinguisher from the airplane was found with the handle lock pin missing  and bottle fully discharged.  The instrument panel was completely destroyed by post-impact fire.  The vacuum pump was separated and the drive coupling was bent approximately 30-degrees.  The unit was disassembled and the rotor vanes were observed to be in place and not damaged.  The core element was cracked.  The intake and exhaust pipes were separated; the exhaust pipes were separated aft of the mufflers.  Examination revealed that the left side ball flange clamp had four washers on the bolt.  The clamp was tight on the ball flange, and the tailpipe would not move on the ball flange.  The exhaust pipes were separated on both sides of the left ball flange.  Due to the extensive post-impact fire damage, it could not be concluded as to the cause of the pilot's reported loss of instruments during the flight.  However, it was noted that the wire bundle that connects the instrument panel through the firewall were in close proximity to the muffler's exhaust flange, on the engine side of the firewall.    ",
