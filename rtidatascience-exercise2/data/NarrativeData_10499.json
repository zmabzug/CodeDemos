The ground employee in the deice bucket experienced a minor injury.  Weather at the time of the event was reported as dark lighting conditions with 2 miles visibility in blowing snow and clouds at 900 feet.The flight crew reported that they taxied to the deice area and called the deice pad coordinator.  The crew taxied the airplane onto the pad in response to marshaller lighted wand signals.  The First Officer observed that the two vehicles on the right side of the airplane were outside the painted taxiway edge lines.  The operation was not using wing walkers.  The First Officer noted that the wingtip area is outside the field of view from the flight deck windows.  The marshaller began to signal the crew to stop, at the same time the deice coordinator radioed them to stop the airplane, and the pilot reported he felt a shudder.  The right wing of the airplane contacted the deice vehicle approximately 4 feet from the right winglet at the number 8 slat.  The deice bucket passed under the wing surface, puncturing a fuel tank leading to a fuel spill of approximately 75 gallons.  The coordinator advised the crew to shut down the engines and that they had a fuel leak.  The crew was unaware the airplane had struck the vehicle, until informed by maintenance personnel.  The airplane was towed back to parking, and the crew exited via the main entry door.The right forward wing spar lower cap, forward flange had a horizontal crack about 10 inches long.  Additional damage included the right outboard aileron, right wing slats and associated hardware, right wing leading edge behind the slat, right wing fuel tip tank vent manifold, lower skin plank, and three fuel tank panels.

The private pilot, pilot rated passenger and passenger were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed from Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV), Savannah, Georgia about 1145 and was destined for Okeechobee County Airport (OBE), Okeechobee, Florida. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, he planned to fly the airplane to OBE for a 50 hour service and some cosmetic work. During the pilot's preflight he noted about 7 quarts of oil in the engine and subsequently departed. About 1 hour into the flight and during a descent to 8,000 feet, the pilot noticed the oil pressure drop \"into the red\"; the other instruments remained \"in the green.\" The pilot reported the loss of oil pressure to ATC and about a minute later the oil pressure dropped to zero. He identified the nearest airport as TIX and started an emergency descent. As they approached 3,000 feet, the engine quit and smoke began to come into the cabin through the fresh air vents. The pilot completed a forced landing to runway 27 and once the airplane came to rest he observed flames coming from the cowling. A fire consumed most of the airplane after the pilot and passengers egressed. Initial examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the engine cowling was destroyed by fire and portions of the airframe and cabin area were substantially damaged. At the time he also noted the cylinder #3 exhaust rocker box cover was completely missing and another hung from two screws. The cylinder #2 exhaust box rocker cover was loose and missing multiple screws. The fire department searched runway 27 and the adjacent grass areas, but did not locate the missing rocker cover. Postaccident examination of the airplane was conducted on-scene by representatives of the engine and airframe manufacturer and supervised by the FAA. A large amount of soot and thermal by-products were observed on the cylinder #3 exposed rocker arm and surrounding head surfaces. There was a small hole on the top of the right crankcase half near the cylinder #5 base and a similar hole was observed on the left crankcase half near the base of cylinder #4. The through-bolt nut to the top rear crankcase section was missing and its associated washer was located on top of the adjacent oil cooler tank.

The spark plugs displayed \"normal\" deposits and wear, except the No. 5 bottom plug was contaminated with a fragment of piston ring material, the No. 5 top plug had a dark sooty appearance, and the nose core of the No. 2 bottom plug was fragmented. Flow bench examination of the left fuel servo revealed no abnormalities. The fuel flow manifold diaphragm was heat-damaged. Flow bench examination of the fuel injector lines and nozzles on a serviceable fuel flow manifold revealed the lines and nozzles were free of obstruction. A review of Emergency Operating Procedures for the Aerostar 601P revealed the following: \"Normal procedures do not require operation below the single engine minimum control speed, however, should this condition inadvertently arise and engine failure occur, power on the operating engine should immediately be reduced and the nose lowered to attain a speed above ... the single engine minimum control speed.\"",

The private pilot was seriously injured and the passenger was fatally injured. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage. The airplane was registered and operated by the pilot under provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed. The cross-country flight originated from Reid-Hillview Airport of Santa Clara County (RHV), San Jose, California at an unknown time.According to a family member who spoke with the pilot, the pilot stated that during the cross-country flight the airplane had a loss of performance while flying in formation with another airplane, which was also destined for 01CL. During the landing attempt the pilot aborted landing for unknown reasons, and continued flying in an eastbound direction. Subsequently, the pilot lost control just prior to impact with terrain.A witness located on the ramp at 01CL saw the airplane perform the aborted landing and noticed nothing unusual about its flight path, although it was at a high altitude as it proceeded across the airport. She then turned her attention to a taxiing airplane. The witness further stated that the gusty winds caused several other airplanes during the day to also abort their landings. The airplane was thought to have departed the area and land at the Placerville Airport (PVF), Placerville, California, which was located about 5 miles south of 01CL. A call to the pilot about 30 minutes later confirmed the accident and its location. Initial examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the forward fuselage and firewall were crushed. The first responders cut fuel lines and control cables while removing the upper wing. The airplane was relocated to a secured facility for further examination.",

The airplane\u2019s maintenance records had been lost and were not provided to the new owner during the sale. The pilot reported that, although he had performed some basic maintenance on the airframe and engine about 3 months before the accident flight, the airplane had not undergone the required annual condition inspection before the  flight.\u000b\u000bOn the day of the accident flight, the pilot \u201ctopped off\u201d the engine\u2019s rotary valve oil tank before conducting several local passenger-carrying flights; the pilot held a student pilot certificate and did not have an endorsement to fly the accident airplane make and model solo nor was he authorized to carry passengers in any aircraft. During the accident flight, while maneuvering at an altitude of about 450 ft above the ground, the engine suddenly lost all power. During the subsequent landing attempt, as the pilot was trying to avoid striking a power line, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and impacted the ground, which resulted in substantial damage to the airframe and serious injury to the pilot. \u000b\u000bPostaccident examination of the engine revealed that one of the rotary valve shaft seals was destroyed and that substantial oil deposits were present inside the air intake, on the pistons and spark plugs, and on components in the engine\u2019s exhaust path. The rotary valve oil tank was also completely absent of oil. Although the exact reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined, the failure of the rotary valve shaft seal likely contributed to its failure. The excessive rotary valve oil consumption was an indication that a rotary valve shaft seal had failed.

The pilot stated that he was taking the newly constructed airplane for its second flight.  The engine that was installed in the airplane was a automotive Subaru EJ20.  He took off from runway 26 and was climbing at 90 mph.  Everything seemed normal and then he noticed that his airspeed was 60 mph and the engine sound had decreased.  There were no pops or abnormal engine sounds associated with the decrease in airspeed and the engine rpm was down at 1,700 instead of the normal 6,000.  The pilot immediately manipulated the throttle to ensure it was fully opened, he then turned the ignition switch off and on in an attempt to reset the electronic engine control.  Both actions failed to regain full power of the engine.  He notified the tower that he had lost engine power.  He decided to land in a field that was off the end of the runway.  He was flying at 60 mph and had a rate of descent of a couple of hundred feet per minute.  He made an forced landing into the field and was assisted by emergency responders shortly afterwards.

Eyewitnesses located about 5 miles north-northeast of Cordes Lakes observed the helicopter \"explode,\" and first telephoned 911 at 1150 to report the accident. \r\u00a0\rThe helicopter debris trail measured approximately 1,700 feet long, and was oriented along a magnetic track of about 160 degrees. The bulk of the helicopter, including the cockpit/cabin, engine, transmission, tail boom and tail rotor assembly, was located in or near an impact crater at the southern end of the debris trail. The debris trail included the cockpit windshields and doors, cabin sidewall, and cabin interior items. The main rotor assembly, which included the two blades and the hub, was located about 600 feet east of the debris trail. No evidence of any pre-impact failures of the engine, reduction gearbox, transmission, or tail rotor drive assemblies was observed. No evidence of fire or a high-order explosion was observed on any components found in the debris trail, and the only evidence of fire was observed in and around the main impact crater. The debris field was mapped, and the wreckage was subsequently recovered to a secure facility for detailed examination. \r\u00a0\rA partial radar track associated with the helicopter indicated that the first target was acquired at 1138, at an indicated altitude of 6,600 feet. That target was located about 12 miles from SEZ, on a magnetic bearing of 197 degrees. The last radar target associated with the helicopter was recorded at 1150, at an indicated altitude of 5,800 feet. That final target was approximately coincident with the wreckage location. \r\u00a0\rThe pilot held a private pilot certificate with airplane single- and multi-engine land ratings, and was issued a rotorcraft helicopter rating in May 2013. On his most recent application for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate, the pilot reported that he had 1,856 total hours of flight experience. His helicopter flight training and flight examination were conducted in a Hughes 269 helicopter. The helicopter flight examiner stated that the pilot had purchased the UH-1 prior to his completion of his helicopter rating. The examiner estimated that the pilot had less than 100 hours of helicopter flight experience at the time of the accident. \r\u00a0\rFAA information indicated that the helicopter was manufactured in 1974, and was equipped with a Lycoming/Honeywell T-53 series turboshaft engine. \r\u00a0\rThe SEZ 1135 automated weather observation included winds from 230 degrees at 5 knots, gusting to 17 knots; visibility 10 miles, with clear skies. The 1100 winds aloft for about 6,000 feet in the general vicinity of the accident location were from 170 degrees at 13 knots. ",

In an attempt to thwart the hijacking, the pilot pitched over to produce negative \"g\" to disable the hijacker, and headed back to Key West. In the ensuing struggle, the hijacker fell against and bent the retarded throttle. Attempts to straighten the throttle shaft snapped it off, and an idle power ditching was conducted. At water impact, forward motion stopped  violently, and the lap-belted passengers appeared to lose consciousness. The pilot egressed from the right cockpit door, inflated his life vest, and swam to the passenger door to extricate the passengers, but the aircraft started sinking before he could get the door open.

As he crossed the runway threshold at about 65 mph, he added a little power and started moving the control stick aft. The aircraft's nose then moved upwards, partially blocking the pilot's view of the runway, so he looked along the left side of the cowling in an attempt to keep the runway in sight. Although he expected the aircraft to slow rather quickly, it did not do so, and continued to float at a height of about five feet above the ground. The aircraft then suddenly dropped hard onto the runway and bounced back into the air. During this sequence, the pilot \"lost visual orientation with the direction the plane was headed,\" so he added full power in an attempt to execute a go-around, but the aircraft dropped onto the runway a second time. According to the pilot, he then moved the stick to the \"full back\" position, but the aircraft did not lift off again, and instead exited the side of the runway where its left main gear impacted a mound of earth. At that point, the left main gear separated from the aircraft, which continued on for about another thirty yards before the right main gear collapsed, which resulted in significant damage to the wings and fuselage.

The accident flight was the student pilot's first flight in the accident glider make and model.  Prior to his departure, the student pilot received a checkout in the glider from the flight school owner.  The check out was approximately 10 minutes in duration.  The student pilot was not shown how to operate the canopy latch.  The canopy latch was not similar to the latch mechanism that the pilot used on the other glider that he had flown.  The canopy was closed and the pilot did not check that it was locked prior to departure.  The student pilot thought that the canopy locked into place once it was closed because there were springs on the latch.  During the takeoff climb, as the tow airplane lifted the glider 300 feet above ground level, the canopy popped open.  The student pilot reached up and grabbed the canopy.  The student pilot attempted to hold down the canopy with his left arm and fly with his right hand.  He then would remove his right hand from the control stick and attempt to latch the canopy, but the control forces from the airflow would not allow the latch to lock.  After release from the tow airplane, the student pilot continued flying the glider holding down the canopy with his left arm and using his right hand to control the glider.  He ensured that the landing pattern was clear and setup for landing.  As he approached the runway, the glider was above its normal approach speed and the pilot released the canopy and partially applied the spoilers.  The open canopy resulted in a drag condition and the glider sank rapidly and impacted the runway on its main wheel.  The glider then bounced straight up approximately 200 hundred feet and the student pilot moved the stick forward to lower the nose, and in the second ground contact, impacted  two gliders parked on the ramp.  The student pilot had a total time of 35 hours in gliders, with 1.5 hours of solo flight.

He then returned to the airport and picked up another pilot for a familiarization flight. About 1/2 hour into the second flight, the engine sputtered and lost power. The pilot subsequently made an emergency landing on an airstrip, and after performing some troubleshooting, he determined that fuel was not getting from the header tank to the engine. The pilot was able to eventually get the fuel flowing again and ran the engine for about 30 minutes on the ground, followed by accomplishing a successful run up. The pilot then departed the airstrip. He reported that the engine ran well until about 200 feet above ground level. The engine then lost all power, and the pilot glided the airplane into 15-foot-tall trees. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed modifications to the exhaust, intake, ignition, and fuel systems that were not approved by the manufacturer. At the conclusion of the examination, it could not be determined if there was a specific malfunction or a combination of the multiple modifications that led to the loss of engine power.

An airport located about 32 miles north of the departure airport, in the direction of travel, was reporting slightly lower ceilings.

Thus, the pilot likely intended to climb above the altitude of the reported cloud base, and, therefore, he most likely did enter the clouds. No radar data was available for the flight, and there were no eyewitnesses to the accident; however, a witness reported hearing a low flying airplane followed by the sound of an impact. A postaccident examination revealed that the left wing spar had fractured in upward bending as a result of overload; the bottom cap failed in tension. The examination did not disclose any preimpact mechanical problems with the airplane. Federal Aviation Administration guidance indicates that if neither horizon nor surface references exist, the attitude of an airplane must be determined by artificial means from the flight instruments. Further, during periods of low visibility, the supporting senses sometimes conflict with what is seen; when this happens, a pilot is particularly vulnerable to disorientation. The pilot did not possess an instrument rating, which, coupled with the low visibility as he entered the clouds, would have made him vulnerable to spatial disorientation.",

The airline transport pilot and six passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was owned by and registered to Make It Happen Aviation, LLC, and was operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 while on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight that departed Indianapolis International Airport (IND), Indianapolis, Indiana, at 2307 central daylight time.According to preliminary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control (ATC) data, after departure the flight proceeded direct to BMI and climbed to a final cruise altitude of 8,000 feet mean sea level (msl). According to radar data, at 2344:38 (hhmm:ss), about 42 nautical miles (nm) south-southeast of BMI, the flight began a cruise descent to 4,000 feet msl. At 2352:06, the pilot established contact with Peoria Terminal Radar Approach Control, reported being level at 4,000 feet mean sea level (msl), and requested the Instrument Landing System (ILS) Runway 20 instrument approach into BMI. According to radar data, the flight was located about 21 nm south-southeast of BMI and was established on a direct course to BMI at 4,000 feet msl. The approach controller told the pilot to expect radar vectors for the ILS Runway 20 approach. At 2354:18, the approach controller told the pilot to make a right turn to a 330 degree heading. The pilot acknowledged the heading change. At 2359:16, the approach controller cleared the flight to descend to maintain 2,500 feet msl. At 2359:20, the pilot acknowledged the descent clearance.At 0000:01, the approach controller told the pilot to turn left to a 290 heading. The pilot acknowledged the heading change. At 0000:39, the approach controller told the pilot that the flight was 5 nm from EGROW intersection, cleared the flight for the ILS Runway 20 instrument approach, issued a heading change to 230 degrees to intercept the final approach course, and told the pilot to maintain 2,500 feet until established on the inbound course. The pilot correctly read-back the instrument approach clearance, the heading to intercept the localizer, and the altitude restriction.According to radar data, at 0001:26, the flight crossed through the final approach course while on the assigned 230 degree heading before it turned to a southerly heading. The plotted radar data showed the flight made course corrections on both sides of the localizer centerline as it proceeded inbound toward EGROW. At 0001:47, the approach controller told the pilot to cancel his IFR flight plan on the approach control radio frequency, that radar services were terminated, and authorized a change to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). According to radar data, the flight was 3.4 nm outside of EGROW, established inbound on the localizer, at 2,400 feet msl. At 0002:00, the pilot transmitted over the unmonitored CTAF, \"twin Cessna seven eight nine uniform pop is coming up on EGROW, ILS Runway 20, full stop.\" No additional transmissions from the pilot were recorded on the CTAF or by Peoria Approach Control.According to radar data, at 0003:12, the flight crossed over the locator outer marker (EGROW) at 2,100 feet msl. The flight continued to descend while tracking the localizer toward the runway. At 0003:46, the airplane descended below available radar coverage at 1,500 feet msl. The flight was about 3.5 nm from the end of the runway when it descended below radar coverage. Subsequently, at 0004:34, radar coverage was reestablished with the flight about 1.7 nm north of the runway threshold at 1,400 feet msl. The plotted radar data showed that, between 0004:34 and 0005:08, the flight climbed from 1,400 feet msl to 2,000 feet msl while maintaining a southerly course. At 0005:08, the flight began a descending left turn to an easterly course. The airplane continued to descend on the easterly course until reaching 1,500 feet msl at 0005:27. The airplane then began a climb while maintaining an easterly course. At 0005:42, the airplane had flown 0.75 nm east of the localizer centerline and had climbed to 2,000 feet. At 0005:47, the flight descended below available radar coverage at 1,800 feet msl. Subsequently, at 0006:11, radar coverage was reestablished at 1,600 feet msl about 0.7 nm southeast of the previous radar return. The next two radar returns, recorded at 0006:16 and 0006:20, were at 1,900 feet msl and were consistent with the airplane continuing on an easterly course. The final radar return was recorded at 0006:25 at 1,600 feet msl about 2 nm east-northeast of the runway 20 threshold.At 0005, the BMI automated surface observing system reported: wind 060 degrees at 6 knots, an overcast ceiling at 200 feet above ground level (agl), 1/2 mile surface visibility with light rain and fog, temperature 13 degrees Celsius, dew point 13 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 29.98 inches of mercury.",

The airplane was being operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) local flight under the provisions of Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The solo commercial pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight departed a private airstrip near Curry Ridge, Alaska.During an on-scene interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on July 20, a witness reported that while attending an outdoor wedding reception party he observed the accident airplane fly over the wedding reception party, at near tree-top level, traveling between 100-120 knots. He said that the airplane made two successful passes over the group of guests, and on the third pass, the airplane entered a right turn prior to impacting the top of a spruce tree with the main landing gear. The witness noted that after the airplane struck the treetop, he was unable see the airplane descend into the tree and tundra-covered terrain.   During a telephone conversation with the NTSB IIC on July 22, a second witness reported that he observed the airplane descend over the wedding reception party, at near treetop level. He stated that the airplane initiated a climb just before impacting the top of a spruce tree, and the climb continued for about 5 to 6 seconds, before the airplane rolled inverted and subsequently disappeared into the trees. The NTSB IIC along with a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety inspector from Denali Certificate Management Office (CMO) reached the accident site on the morning of July 20. The airplane came to rest in an area of densely populated birch and spruce trees, on its right side at an elevation of about 436 feet MSL, on a heading of about 260 degrees. All the primary flight controls were identified at the accident site; control continuity could not be established due to numerous fractures in the system, but all fractures exhibited features consistent with tension overload.

A witness reported that the airplane took off on Runway 17, climbed about 100 feet, and then nosed down. The weather was clear and the wind was nearly straight down the runway. The flight instructor had logged nearly 3,000 hours of total flight time, with over 600 hours instruction and over 600 hours in the Cessna 172. Examination of the aircraft revealed no evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction. The flight instructor had a long history of diabetes, and had recently started a new injectable medication (exenatide, 10 micrograms twice a day) to help control his blood sugar. This medication can result in impairment due to low blood sugar, but he had not reported any adverse effects, and he was observed to be behaving normally the day prior to and the day of the accident. He was at extremely high risk of obstructive sleep apnea given his height (70 inches), weight (285 pounds), and poorly controlled blood pressure. Obstructive sleep apnea often results in impairment, but he was apparently not observed to snore while sleeping, a hallmark of the condition. Autopsy revealed an enlarged heart (it weighed 500 grams), but it was not thickened, suggesting an apparently unrecognized heart condition, dilated cardiomyopathy, that can result in sudden incapacitation. Given the failure of this experienced instructor pilot to either execute a normal climbout or appropriately oversee the climbout by his novice student, it is possible that he was incapacitated by a cardiac event.

During the phone call the briefing specialist (specialist) asked the pilot if he had Convective Sigmet 47E, which was covered the departure airport and was issued approximately 10 minutes earlier.  The pilot advised the specialist he had the information about the sigmet, but he did not need any weather services.  There was no record that the pilot obtained a preflight weather briefing from the 2 DUAT vendors.  Additionally, the departure airport had a computer with access to weather but it does not record who accessed the computer and there was no records found in the wreckage associated with the computer printout.  The flight departed, and shortly after takeoff air traffic control communications were transferred from the air traffic control tower to Myrtle Beach Air Traffic Control Tower.  The pilot established contact with that facility and the controller questioned why the pilot was deviating without clearance.  The controller asked the pilot if he could accept a northerly heading and he advised he could not.  The controller vectored the pilot to fly a south-southwesterly heading for traffic which the pilot acknowledged. The controller then advised the pilot that after climbing through 2,600 feet to resume his own navigation.  The flight then proceeded on a northwesterly heading where radar plots indicate that at the altitude flown, the flight encountered VIP Level 5 (intense) echoes.  The airplane was observed on radar in a right descending turn and crashed into a wooded area.  The average rate of descent was calculated to be 4,085 feet-per-minute.  A search for the airplane was initiated and it was located the following morning.  The airplane was equipped with a stormscope and a moving map display with monochromatic weather depiction.  Examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of in-flight break-up.  All major structural components were located in the immediate vicinity of the accident site.  The flaps were nearly retracted and the landing gear was retracted.  Examination of the flight control system for roll, pitch, and yaw revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the engine and propeller revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  No specimens were available for a FAA Toxicology screen.  Examination of the vacuum pump which was impact damaged revealed the drive coupling was not failed.",

A fire then ensued upon ground impact, and the debris field spanned about 370 feet along an azimuth of about 082 degrees. Examination of the airplane wreckage revealed that left wing flap actuator and jack nut measurements were consistent with the wing flaps being extended to 40 degrees, and on the right wing the flap jack nut and actuator measurements were consistent with the right flap being extended to about a 20-degrees. In addition, the right flap torque tube assembly between the flap motor and the flap stop assembly had disconnected, and the flap torque tube assembly's female coupler which attaches to the male spline end of the flap motor and flap stop assembly was found with a cotter pin installed through the female coupler of the flap stop assembly. The cotter pin, had not been placed through the spline and the coupler consistent with normal installation as per Mitsubishi's maintenance manual, or as specified in Airworthiness Directive 88-23-01. Instead, the cotter pin had missed the male spline on the flap motor. In addition, the flap coupler on the opposite side of the flap motor was found to also found to not have a cotter pin installed. Company maintenance records showed that on April 3, 2001, about 87 flight hours before the accident, the airplane was inspected per Airworthiness Directive (AD) 88-23-01, which required the disassembly, inspection, and reassembly of the flap torque tube joints.

Several witnesses observed the helicopter approximately 200-500 feet above ground level (agl) in cruise flight along the coastline on a south heading.  One witness, a former pilot and mechanic, reported he observed the helicopter in straight and level flight, then heard a change in \"rotor noise, followed by a bang/pop/twang sound.\"  The helicopter then \"snap-rolled\" to the left and descended into the terrain in a nose low attitude.  Examination of the helicopter's flight control system revealed that the right forward servo to swashplate push-pull tube joint was disconnected and the attach hardware (bolt, lock nut, two washers, pal nut) was missing.  The left forward servo to swashplate push-pull joint was connected; however, the nut was found partially engaged on the bolt threads, and the torque was \"finger tight\"; no pal nut was noted.  Material analysis of the components revealed that only one of the two nuts for the left and right connections were installed, and then only finger tight.  The nut on right servo connection rotated off during flight which allowed the bolt to extract itself and disconnect the servo from the push-pull tube.  Prior to the accident flight, an inspection, which required the push-pull tubes to servo connections to be disassembled, was performed on the helicopter, and a 0.5-hour maintenance test flight.
