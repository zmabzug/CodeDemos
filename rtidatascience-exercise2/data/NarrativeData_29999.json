The flight returned to its departure point after encountering apparent electrical problems, including circuit breakers open for the center tank right pump and the right tank forward pump.   After landing, the crew performed a normal shutdown.  During taxi in, they noted an electrical smell, which they originally attributed to use of the galley ovens.  When they elected to disembark the passengers, passengers leaving the airplane who had been seated mid-cabin noted that they had smelled electrical smoke.   The airplane was repowered by maintenance personnel after shut-down and disembarking of passengers.  During the trouble-shooting process, additional systems and indicators were affected, including right wing anti-ice and right wing overheat.  Technicians isolated an electrical short to the forward cargo compartment.  When they touched the panel around station 410, they saw some sparks.  Power was removed from the aircraft once the damage was found.  The technicians opened the ceiling panel to gain access to the area.  When they touched the bottom of the raceway clamp, it fell apart.  FAA and NTSB investigators documented the damaged wiring bundles at station 420 above the forward cargo compartment ceiling on the right side of the airplane, and had them sectioned for further inspection and testing.  The wire bundle channel and clamp were also removed for inspection and analysis.  A total of 113 conductors were reported to have been subjected to the electrical arcing event. Investigators were unable to determine the cause of electrical arcing that burned numerous wires of the subject bundles in two.  One of the nine Teflon insulated wires, W336-003-10, exhibited evidence that it might have been damaged prior to the electrical arcing.   W336-003-10, and two other 10 gauge wires in the bundles, were conductors for the three-phase 115VAC system A electric hydraulic pump.  Electrical arcing had damaged approximately twelve inches of insulation on wire W336-003-10.  The exposed conductors at one end of the wire had sustained arc damage at two locations.  The arcing burned several wire strands in two, which became unraveled from the rest of the strands.  There was approximately one third of the insulation left in this area of the wire.  A small area of the edge of the insulation appeared to have been cut prior to the occurrence of the electrical arcing.  The wire bundle channel (bracket) and clamp were also analyzed.  Evidence indicated that an unidentified  wire that was involved in the arcing/burning event had been out of place, along the side of the bracket between the cushioning foam and the plastic (nylon) frame before or during the event.

The pilot recalled that he rotated about 50 to 60 knots and was about two-thirds of the way down the runway when the airplane climbed about 10 to 12 feet over the runway. The landing gear doors closed and the airplane reached an altitude of about 50 feet; however, both the pilot and passenger reported that the airplane felt like it was not gaining speed or altitude. The airplane started to descend and shortly thereafter impacted a tree stump, tree debris, and the ground. The wreckage examination revealed that the flaps were in the full up position at the time of impact. A review of the airplane\u2019s onboard flight manual, Section III, Normal Procedures, advises pilots that, for a minimum run takeoff, they should  \u201cuse 75 percent of flaps.\u201d  The manual also advises pilots on proper technique, what variables to consider, and instructs them to check performance graph charts for proper takeoff settings and indications. The manual\u2019s performance charts make reference to hard-surface runways but contain no reference to soft (grass strip) field takeoff calculations. The pilot did not mention  having performed any calculations for the grass strip prior to the takeoff.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate takeoff performance planning and procedures, which resulted in an attempted takeoff on a grass runway that was not long enough for the given conditions and airplane configuration."

Fuselage and cockpit structure was found partially collapsed in a downward direction.  The continuity of the flight control system was confirmed, and no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction was found.  The purpose of the flight was for the flight school's instructor to provide initial training to a foreign student pilot, who was an instructor pilot in military aircraft, and to familiarize him with the flight characteristics of the airplane prior to the student's enrollment in a test pilot program.  The foreign pilot was not qualified to act as pilot-in-command of the accident airplane. The flight school's instructor was current in the accident airplane.  The syllabus for the planned 1-hour-long familiarization flight included stalls, with the landing gear and wing flaps retracted and extended, in addition to velocity minimum control demonstrations.  The instructor pilot was to demonstrate a maneuver followed by the student performing the maneuver.  A review of radar data indicated that the airplane was maneuvered through a series of stalls from 0847 until 0853.  At 0853:20, the airplane's altitude indicated 5,900 feet.  At 0853:49, the altitude indicated 3,500 feet, and the groundspeed decreased to 60 knots, where it remained until the airplane disappeared from radar at 0853:54.  The airplane's radar position remained relatively constant during the final seconds of recorded flight, as the airplane descended at 5,000 feet per minute until impacting 2,600 foot mean sea level (msl) terrain.  It was not determined whether one or both of the pilots were handling the controls at the time the spin commenced.  Flight records from the test pilot school indicated that the student had accrued one flight in a multiengine airplane, with a flight time of 1.2 hours.  His total flight time was about 1,531 hours with the majority of his flight time accrued in F16 type military aircraft.  The instructor, who was the director of flight operations and the flying safety officer for the school, had a total flight time of about 5,767 hours.  An estimated 122 hours had been accumulated in the accident make and model airplane, with 27.4 of those hours accumulated in the past year.  The weight and balance data was found to be within acceptable limits for the flight.  The airplane flight manual prohibited the performance of spins.  No determination could be made as to which pilot may have been manipulating the controls at the time of the departure from controlled flight.",
            "probable_cause": "The flying pilot's failure to obtain/maintain control of the airplane during practice stalls, which resulted in the inadvertent entry into a spin.  "

The door landed in downtown Saint Louis. During examination of the door's lower forward mounting bracket, rounded threads were found on the mounting eyebolt, and associated hardware was missing.

            "narrative": "On September 3, 2014, about 1238 mountain daylight time, a Piper model PA-46-350P airplane, N747TH, was substantially damaged while landing at the Cortez Municipal Airport (CEZ), Cortez, Colorado. The commercial pilot-receiving-instruction and his flight instructor sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by Philburto Aviation, LTD, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local instructional flight, which had departed shortly before the accident.The flight instructor reported that the purpose of the flight was for the pilot to receive flight instruction toward satisfying his insurance company's annual currency requirements in the accident airplane. The flight instructor stated that on a previous flight, completed earlier that morning, they had completed several visual flight rules (VFR) flight maneuvers before deciding to conduct takeoff-and-landings at CEZ. The flight instructor reported that following several uneventful landings, they decided to perform a simulated loss of engine power following a takeoff from runway 21 (7,205 feet by 100 feet, asphalt) and return for a downwind landing on runway 3.The flight instructor stated that during initial climb from runway 21, upon reaching 1,200 feet above ground level (agl), he reduced the engine power lever to flight idle and feathered the propeller. Following the simulated loss of engine power, the pilot-receiving-instruction reduced airplane pitch and rolled into a 45-degree bank left turn back toward the airport. The flight instructor reported that the pilot-receiving-instruction maintained best-glide airspeed (90 knots) throughout the left turn and rolled wings-level when the airplane was heading toward the runway 3 identification numbers. The flight instructor stated that, upon rolling wings level, the airplane appeared to be lower than he had expected as it glided toward runway 3. The pilot-receiving-instruction reportedly stated that he thought they would need to increase engine power in order to reach the runway; however, the flight instructor still thought there was sufficient altitude remaining to safely land on the runway and told the pilot to continue without an increase in engine power. The flight instructor reported that he ultimately decided to abort the maneuver as the airplane crossed over the runway 3 threshold at about 40 feet agl. He stated that despite the airplane having sufficient altitude remaining to land on the remaining runway, he thought it would be safer to abort the simulated engine failure and recover under powered-flight. The flight instructor reported that he took control of the airplane, advanced the engine power lever to the full forward position, and increased airplane pitch to arrest the descent; however, he did not perceive an increase in thrust from the engine after increasing the engine power lever. Without an increase in engine thrust, the airplane's airspeed decreased rapidly and the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall about 30 feet above the runway. The airplane impacted the runway, about 500 feet from the approach threshold, before it slid to a stop off the right side of the runway in a grassy area. The flight instructor reported that the engine continued to operate following the accident, and that he secured it by pulling the condition lever to the full aft position. The main wing spar and fuselage were substantially damaged during the impact sequence.The flight instructor reported that he did not recall advancing the propeller control when he decided to abort the maneuver, and as such, the perceived lack of engine thrust was likely because the propeller remained feathered after he advanced the engine power lever. Additionally, the flight instructor reported that neither he or the pilot-receiving-instruction remember extending the landing gear following the simulated engine failure; however, both pilots recalled seeing the landing gear position lights illuminated during the maneuver. The flight instructor postulated that the airplane's landing gear had not been retracted after takeoff, which resulted in a reduced climb gradient due to the additional aerodynamic drag of the extended landing gear, and as such, the airplane entered the maneuver farther away from the airport than anticipated. Furthermore, with the landing gear extended, the airplane experienced a reduction in glide performance following the simulated loss of engine power.The flight instructor reported that the accident could have been prevented had he maintained a safe flying airspeed after he took control of the airplane. Additionally, the flight instructor believed that his delayed decision to abort the maneuver had resulted in an insufficient margin of safety.At 1253, the CEZ automated surface observing system (ASOS) reported: wind 220 degrees at 12 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear sky, temperature 29 degrees Celsius; dew point 1 degrees Celsius; and an altimeter setting of 30.07 inches of mercury.",

The pilot made a forced landing and the airplane collided with trees and the ground. The pilot stated that, about 30 flight hours before this accident, the airplane experienced a similar severe vibration in flight. He shut down the engine and made a successful forced landing to a nearby airport. Examination of the airplane revealed that a triangle-shaped aluminum plate on the rear of the propeller hub had cracked. The pilot installed a new propeller hub and the original propeller blades about 7 months before the accident and began flying again without any vibrations. The total hours on the propeller blades are unknown.A postaccident examination at the accident site revealed that both carburetors had separated from the engine assembly and were hanging by their fuel lines and throttle cables. One composite propeller blade was delaminated with a large section missing. The remaining two propeller blades appeared to be intact without comparable or crash-related damage. The carburetor detachment likely caused the final engine failure and this separation was likely a consequence of the severe vibration.Metallurgical examination of the propeller blades identified that separation of a portion of blade No. 1 initiated as a transverse fracture, originating near the trailing edge of the blade. The transverse fracture was progressive in nature, with the crack propagating in some combination of fatigue and/or stress rupture under continually applied loads. Blade No. 2 also exhibited a pattern of parallel transverse cracks on its aft side. Blade No. 3 was also visibly damaged, with significant delamination or disbonding of the woven carbon-fiber composite skin from the forward side of the blade, along with delamination at the trailing edge.

The pilots reported that prior to departure, there were no known mechanical malfunctions or abnormalities with the airplane, including the brakes, flaps, anti-skid, or thrust reversers. The copilot, who was the pilot monitoring, calculated a Vref speed of 108 knots for the landing weight. Postaccident analysis determined that a more precise Vref based on weight would have been 110 knots.  Both pilots reported that they set their airspeed index bugs to 108 knots about 11 miles from the airport.  The pilot reported that the airplane touched down about 1,000 feet from the approach end of the runway. Both crewmembers reported that, although they used maximum thrust reversers, brakes, and ground spoilers, they could feel a \u201cpulsation\u201d in the brake system and that the airplane hydroplaned. The airplane overran the wet runway with standing water and came to rest 283 feet beyond the paved portion of the runway in a treed area off the airport. Postaccident examination of the airspeed index bugs revealed that the pilot\u2019s was set to 115 knots and that the copilot\u2019s was set to 105 knots, which correlated with their calculated and reported V1 and V2 departure speeds. It is likely that they did not move the airspeed bugs during the approach to landing. Postaccident testing of the brake system components did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or abnormalities that would have precluded normal operation. \u000bBased on radar data, the airplane was likely 15 to 19 knots above the reference speed of 110 knots when it crossed the runway threshold. The data further revealed that the approach was flown with about a 4-degree glideslope approach angle instead of the recommended 3-degree glideslope angle. The pilots reported that the precision approach path indicator lights, which would have provided an approximate 3-degree approach, became inoperable shortly after activation. Although the touchdown location could not be accurately determined, given the approximate glideslope and the excessive speed, the airplane likely floated before touching down.   It is also likely that the pilots, familiar with landing at their home airport, which is configured with a grooved runway that mitigates wet runway conditions more effectively, relied on their past wet runway experience  and failed to calculate their landing distance using the appropriate performance chart for the contaminated runway. Based on the airplane\u2019s performance charts, on a contaminated runway, an airplane with a Vref of 110 knots would need a 4,800-foot runway; at Vref + 10 knots, the airplane would need 6,100 feet to land. The runway was 4,694 feet long. Hence, the lack of a clear understanding of the actual wet runway landing distance necessary to stop and the excessive approach speed resulted in the airplane crossing the approach end of the runway at a speed and flight profile unsuitable for the wet runway condition and without sufficient distance available to stop.

He was participating in a group flight-seeing trip touring Alaska, that departed the state of Washington several days earlier.   Each of the group's ten participants had provided their own airplanes for the tour.  Prior to the accident flight, the group had been briefed by the group leader, an experienced commercial pilot with significant Alaska mountain flight experience, on the suggested route and altitudes through mountainous terrain to a rendezvous at another airport.  An FAA inspector also made a presentation to the group that morning on some of the hazards associated with flying in the mountains.  The group departed in small groups at close intervals.  The accident pilot and two other pilots elected to initially fly a course parallel to the one suggested, up a different drainage/canyon.  The intent was to join the suggested route later in the flight.  A pilot flying above and behind the accident airplane noted that there was steeply rising terrain at the end on the canyon, and he started his climb before the accident pilot to clear a saddle between two peaks.  He stated that the accident pilot, who was about 700-1000 feet lower than him, started his climb too late, and collided with a rock face, about 300 feet below the 5,000 feet msl saddle.

He declared an emergency and an air traffic controller provided vectors for an instrument approach into a nearby airport. The pilot stated that the vibrations increased in severity and available engine power was decreasing. The pilot adjusted the mixture and throttle to no effect; he did not cycle the magnetos because he didn\u2019t want to risk losing engine power completely. After descending through the 2,000-ft broken cloud layer on the instrument approach, he determined that the airplane was not going to make it to the runway. At 1,000 ft above ground level, he deployed the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System, which brought the airplane down into an open field. He and his passenger rapidly exited the airplane before it was dragged away by the parachute in a 30-knot wind.\u000b\u000bEngine data indicated that, 2 hours\u00a056 minutes into the flight, the engine rpm started to fluctuate. Two minutes later, the cylinder head temperature (CHT) of the No. 6 cylinder increased and peaked at 331 degrees F; 7 minutes later, it had decreased to 248 degrees F. At this point, the CHT for the No. 3 cylinder increased to 315 degrees F. About 3 hours\u00a013 minutes into the flight, the engine exhaust gas temperatures (EGT) of cylinder Nos. 2, 4, 5, and 6 dropped off while the EGTs for cylinder Nos. 1 and 3 increased. Examination of the left and right magnetos revealed that the right magneto distributor drive gear had 10 teeth fractured off in the same gear sector, and the left magneto had 3 teeth broken in the same sector; all of the fracture surfaces on both gears exhibited crack arrest marks and river patterns consistent with progressive fracture.\u000b\u000bBased on the right magneto distributor gear damage, it is likely that the failure of the distributor drive gear teeth allowed the magneto distributor to stop rotating in proper firing order and allowed unsequenced repeated firing of the No. 6 cylinder and later the No. 3 cylinder, as reflected by the increase in CHT, which resulted in severe engine vibration and a partial loss of power. The unsequenced firing of the Nos. 6 and 3 cylinders also precipitated erratic power pulses through the engine that affected the left magneto distributor drive gear, which in turn initiated the left magneto distributor gear teeth failure.\u000b\u000bThe pilot operating handbook lists the steps the pilot should take in the event of an engine partial power loss. Step seven of the engine partial power loss emergency procedures calls for the pilot to cycle through the left and right magnetos using the ignition switch. It is likely that, if the pilot had selected the left magneto after the initial indications of partial power loss and vibration, power could have been restored by isolating the right magneto and operating the engine entirely on the left magneto.",
            "probable_cause": "The distributor gear teeth failure of the right magneto that resulted in severe engine vibration and partial loss of engine power, which progressively led to the failure of the left magneto distributor drive gear teeth. Contributing to the airplane\u2019s continued operation with the partial loss of engine power was the pilot\u2019s failure to execute all steps in the engine partial power loss procedure."

Gusting wind from the south had prevailed for most of the day and was present at the time of the accident. As the pilot turned to \"enter the landing area,\" he felt a \u201cbump\u201d in the tail rotor control pedals. The pilot added that he applied left pedal to compensate for a right yaw, and the helicopter immediately \"started to rotate\" at an increasing yaw rate with full left pedal applied. The pilot stated that the rotation stopped when he pushed the collective control \"full down\" and applied aft cyclic. The helicopter then descended through the trees and collided with terrain. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of pre-impact mechanical anomaly.U.S. Army guidance listed high gross weight, high-density altitude, low indicated airspeed, power droop, and right downwind turns as factors that may contribute to a loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) and described vortex ring state, or settling with power, as a condition in which the helicopter loses lift and settles in its own downwash. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidance cautioned pilots to remain vigilant to power and wind conditions and stated that low airspeed, out-of-ground-effect (OGE), and high-power-demand flight conditions were conducive to LTE. Additionally, FAA guidance described unanticipated right yaw in helicopters, or LTE, as a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic, which could result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate that does not subside of its own accord, and, if not corrected, could result in a loss of aircraft control. When operating at airspeeds below effective translational lift, pilots should avoid OGE hover and high-power demand situations, such as low-speed downwind turns. Contributing factors for LTE include high gross weight/high density altitude, low indicated airspeed, power droop, and right downwind turns. Therefore, the pilot\u2019s performance of a high-power, low-speed downwind turn during gusting wind likely caused the LTE. ",

The accident occurred during EAA AirVenture 2002, at Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  The PA-20 pilot was cleared to land on the \"orange dot\" (1,500 from the threshold) on runway 27.  A Cessna 172 was cleared to land on the numbers of runway 27.  The PA-20 pilot reported that during his landing flare, he saw the Cessna 172 underneath his airplane.  He pulled up and to the right to avoid a collision with the other Cessna 172.  He stated he added full throttle and leveled the nose, but a strong wind from the left rolled the airplane to the left and \"without enough airspeed for effective aileron\" he could not reverse the roll.  The airplane stalled and spun into the runway from an altitude of about 120 feet.

Winds at the time of the accident were from 230 degrees at 12 knots gusting to 22 knots.   As announced on the airport terminal information service (ATIS), the VFR Oshkosh Arrival, Yellow Flow procedures were in effect at the time of the accident.  The Yellow Flow instructs pilots to join the other traffic over over a VFR checkpoint.  The traffic then travels around the northwest side of the airport, entering a right base leg for either runway 18L or 18R.  In addition to landing VFR traffic on runway 18L and 18R, air traffic control (ATC) was landing VFR traffic on runway 27.  This was accomplished by having the VFR traffic extend their base leg for the 18 runways, putting them on a right downwind for runway 27.  The VFR landings on runway 27 were not outlined as part of the Yellow Flow procedures.  The only landings on runway 27 that are a part of the procedure were IFR arrivals approaching the airport from the east and warbirds who were to approach the airport from the southeast.

Therefore, the pilot concentrated on performing the forced landing. The pilot landed in an open field. During rollout on the uneven terrain, the nose gear collapsed and the firewall was bent. Subsequently, the airplane was recovered and examined and no anomalies were found. The engine was test run and no evidence of any mechanical malfunction was noted. The airplane was equipped with an engine monitoring system that retained various engine related operating parameters. The extracted nonvolatile memory data revealed that the engine's exhaust gas temperature peaked a few seconds before the fuel flow decreased to zero and all power was lost.

The tour was intended to circumnavigate the west Maui Mountains with occasional close-up views of majestic locations.  About 45 minutes before the accident, while returning from another tour flight, the pilot had flown near the accident site area.  A videotape made during the earlier flight indicated that clouds were approaching the transition route into the valley, and the pilot elected to bypass it as did other tour pilots due to the clouds obscuring the mountain peaks in the Iao Valley.  According to other company pilots, the weather conditions were typical for the area and included the tendency  for rapidly changing conditions.    When the search had begun for the overdue tour flight, the search pilots were unable to proceed up the valley due to the low height of the clouds.  A witness in the Iao Valley State Park indicated that about 1000, he observed the Iao Needle (a vertical rock spire rising from the valley floor).  The witness stated he noticed that a solid ceiling of clouds stretched from one side of the valley to the other (north to south).  The cloud base obscured the upper 1/4 to 1/3 of the needle.  (The Iao Needle's elevation at the top is about 2,250 feet msl, and it is located about 2 miles east of the accident site.)  Three other tour flights were conducted within 2 miles of the accident site between 0950 and 1031.  According to the pilots of these flights, the tours were modified to exclude the area flown by the accident pilot because of the weather conditions they observed in the area.  Specifically, clouds obscured the Iao Valley ridgelines.  Based on recorded radar data, about 10 minutes before completing the planned 30-minute-long tour, the pilot attempted to transition from the leeward to the windward side of the island via an established route into the Iao Valley.  The pilot entered an area having multiple layers of clouds while climbing northward from 3,400 to 3,900 feet.  Within 1 minute, the pilot reversed course and attempted to exit the valley.  The pilot likely became disoriented regarding his location relative to the previously overflown ridgeline, and while in instrument meteorological conditions descended to 2,850 feet, whereupon the helicopter impacted nearly perpendicular to the face of the mountain. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate decision by which he continued visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions.  Also causal was his failure to maintain terrain clearance resulting in a collision with mountainous terrain.  A contributing factor was the low ceiling."
