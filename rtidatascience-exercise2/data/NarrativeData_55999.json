The pilot agreed to fly a passenger, who was a student pilot, to another airport. The passenger reported that, after boarding the airplane, he was not briefed on how to use the lapbelt, which the pilot secured for him. The passenger also reported that the pilot did not ask him his weight for the purpose of weight and balance calculations. The pilot did not perform a preflight inspection per the passenger\u2019s account. Based on all available data from the pilot, maintenance records, and airplane documents located in the wreckage, the airplane was near or at its maximum gross weight at the time of engine start. After taxiing to the departure runway, the pilot did not perform an engine runup. He then taxied onto the grass runway, applied the brakes, and applied full power. The pilot reported that the airplane accelerated but not as fast as he thought it should have. The pilot reported that it took a long time to accelerate to 60 mph, and, about the point when he was considering aborting the takeoff, the airplane became airborne. After becoming airborne, the pilot stated that the airplane climbed to 400 feet, cleared power lines, then began descending. He maneuvered the airplane toward a clearing, and, while descending, the right wing collided with trees. The airplane then impacted the ground in a right-wing-low attitude and a fire ensued. The pilot and passenger exited the airplane. The passenger later reported having difficulty unlatching his restraint because he was not familiar with it. The delay in releasing his restraint most likely resulted in greater burn injury to the passenger than had it been immediately released.Postaccident examination of the engine revealed no compression in three of the four cylinders, but this was most likely due to the postcrash fire. Further examination of the thermally damaged engine revealed that the left magneto produced spark when rotated by hand, but the right magneto did not produce spark. Postaccident inspection of the right magneto revealed extensive heat damage, which precluded operational testing; therefore, no determination could be made as to whether there was preimpact failure or malfunction of the right magneto. Based on available evidence, the airplane\u2019s poor acceleration during takeoff was most likely due to being near or at its maximum gross weight and operating from a grass runway.

Please see the docket for this accident to view the original report.**While flying an approach, the pilot attempted to contact one of his flight instructors. A witness reported and radar data showed the airplane approaching the runway at a higher-than-normal speed. As the airplane leveled low over the runway, the propeller began striking the runway surface. The damage from repetitive propeller strikes resulted in a loss of the thrust and airspeed necessary for flight. The airplane impacted the ground and subsequently caught fire. The postaccident examination of the wreckage confirmed that the airplane was configured with the landing gear and flaps retracted. No mechanical anomalies were observed that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. Weight and balance estimates of the airplane indicated that the pilot was operating the airplane outside of its certified weight and center of gravity limits. Forensic toxicology performed on the pilot showed the presence of Hydrocodone and Dihydrocodeine, indicative of the pilot using disqualifying sedating cough or pain medications. These medications can impair performance in high workload environments. The level of medication found in the pilot\u2019s blood at the time of the accident could not be determined. Additionally, Nortriptyline was detected in the pilot\u2019s tissues.

FAA issued a ferry permit. The airplane was placed in a heated hangar the night before the flight. When the pilot preflighted the airplane the next morning, 'a little water' was found in the gascolator and 'a tiny amount' was found in the right wing sump. He chose not to have the fuel drained and the airplane serviced with fresh fuel. He later told a local newspaper that he had drained the fuel system and thought he had removed all the water, 'but apparently it was not enough.' He was unsuccessful in trying to start the engine. After it was preheated, the engine started, and he performed 'an extended time warm up and extended pretakeoff run-up.' Shortly after taking off, the engine lost 'complete power.' The pilot enriched the mixture and turned the auxiliary fuel pump first to LOW, then to HIGH. Power returned momentarily, then the engine lost power again. The pilot did not have a chance to switch fuel tanks, but concentrated instead on the forced landing.

Fuel lines from both wing tanks were then routed to a \"mixer block,\" which was located about 2 feet below the tanks.

Propeller slash marks and portions of the nose landing gear fairing were noted along the length of the furrow.  Examination of the airplane revealed the nose landing gear was displaced aft; the nose gear leg was bent, and the canopy bubble was shattered.  The F-631 frame (inverted \"U\" shaped structure which is vertically oriented and located immediately aft of the pilot and co-pilot seats) designed to protect the flight crew in the event of a nose-over ground accident, was crushed down.  A longitudinally oriented structural member (F-632A channel brace) that provides structural support to the F-631 frame and also to the F-606 bulkhead located aft of the pilot and co-pilot seats, was separated at the F-606 bulkhead (pictures of the separated channel brace are located in the NTSB Docket for this case).

The pilot of the on-demand cargo flight was brought in off reserve to replace the scheduled pilot who was ill.  The flight was behind schedule because the cargo was late.  When the instrument flight release created further delay, the pilot opted to depart into the clear, dark night under visual flight rules (VFR) with the intention of picking up his instrument clearance when airborne.  When clearing the flight for takeoff, the tower controller issued a suggested heading of 340 degrees, which headed the aircraft toward mountainous terrain 11 miles north of the airport.  The purpose of the suggested heading was never stated to the pilot as required by FAA Order 7110.65L.  After a frequency change to radar departure control, the controller asked the pilot 'are you direct [the initial (route) fix] at this time?' and the pilot replied, 'we can go ahead and we'll go direct [the initial fix].'  A turn toward the initial fix would have headed the aircraft away from high terrain.  The controller then diverted his attention to servicing another VFR aircraft and the accident aircraft continued to fly heading 340 degrees until impacting the mountain.  ATC personnel said the 340-degree heading was routinely issued to departing aircraft to avoid them entering Class B airspace 3 miles from the airport.

When the pilot said that he would go to the initial fix, the controller expected him to turn away from the terrain.

He then leveled the wings and looked at the wing root fuel sight gauges to confirm that the airplane had fuel. At the same time, the engine again began to run rough. The pilot rocked the wings to ensure that there was no air lock in the fuel lines and confirmed that the magnetos were on and the primer was in; however, the engine lost total power, the propeller stopped completely, and the airplane descended into a tree. The airplane was subsequently removed from the tree, fuel was confirmed onboard, and no preexisting mechanical anomalies were noted. The airplane's wings were then removed for its transport to a storage facility. At the facility, an auxiliary fuel tank was placed on top of the cabin, with fuel flow directly to the carburetor.

A carburetor icing probability chart revealed that, at the ambient temperature and dew point at the time of the accident, conditions favored carburetor icing at glide and cruise power.

There were no injuries to the three passengers or three crewmembers onboard and the aircraft was substantially damaged.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  The flight had originated from Tarin Kowt Airport (OATN), Tarin Kowt, AfghanistanAccording to the flight crew, the takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful. The captain was the flying pilot.  At 11:12 the flight was cleared for the approach and at 11:16 the flight crew selected flaps 35 and initiated a random steep approach in accordance with company task procedures as a result of the airport threat level.  According to the flight crew statements, the airplane engine power was reduced to idle for the approach and was not increased prior to landing.  Information obtained from Flight Data Recorder (FDR) indicated engine torque was at or near zero for the last 5 minutes of approach and landing.The aviation routine weather report at 0550 local time indicated wind from 120 degrees at 5 knots, 8000 meters visibility and temperature 17 degrees C.  For the two minutes prior to landing, the wind was light and variable.  A tactical meteorological observation system on the field reported the wind direction during the two minutes prior to landing as variable from 004 degrees to 137 degrees and the wind speed variable from 1 knot to 7.2 knots.  Wind gust recorded during the time period varied from 050 degrees to 079 degrees at 7.0 to 7.2 knots.Based on FDR data the calculated rate of descent was about 2,000 feet per minute during approach, reducing to about 1,500 feet per minute just prior to landing.  The airplane touched down with a nose up pitch attitude of approximately 8 degrees and a peak vertical acceleration of 2.7g.  The airplane geometry information provided by the manufacturer indicated that aft fuselage contact will result from a pitch attitude over 11.9 degrees with an extended landing gear oleo strut, and a pitch attitude over 6.8 degrees with a compressed landing gear oleo strut.In order to avoid nuisance warnings resulting from the random steep approach (i.e. steep angle descent), the flight crew deactivated the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) for approach.  As these alerts would be expected by the crew during this type of approach, it is unlikely the alerts would have prompted the crew to take corrective action.The airplane touched down and contacted the aft fuselage on the runway resulting in substantial damage (including buckled, cracked, and bent frames and stringers).",

The number 2 and 3 connecting rods exhibited heat discoloration and lack of lubrication. Bearing material was extruded, the connection rods were separated, and both were found in multiple pieces. The number 4 connecting rod remained attached, and the bearing showed early signs of heat discoloration and lack of lubrication. The connecting rod separations exhibited overload signatures, and there were no signs of fatigue.

The pilot \"did not use wet runway performance numbers...[and] did note the 135 landing distance requirements as an aid for safety margin; approximately 6,600 feet.\"  During the downwind leg to runway 26, the crew could see the runway.  Prior to the final approach fix for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 26 and approximately 8 miles from the airport, the crew had the runway in sight.  The pilot flew the airplane on the glideslope approximately VRef (Final Approach Speed) 128 knots plus 10-15 knots, then below 1,000 feet, VRef plus 10 knots.  The crew reported that the airplane touched down approximately 1,500 feet from the approach end of runway 26.  The co-pilot reported the airbrake was in the #2 position and they had \"good anti-skid indication\" after touchdown.  The pilot began braking, deployed the thrust reverser, and continued to increase brake pressure.  With approximately 2,500 feet of runway remaining, the airplane continued to not decelerate normally, and the pilot knew they did not have enough runway to execute a go-around.  With approximately 1,000 feet of runway remaining, the pilot pulled the parking brake to the second detent, and the aircraft slid off the end of the runway into the dirt and muddy terrain.  A performance study revealed that the accident flight crossed the runway 26 threshold at 150 knots airspeed (VRef plus 22 knots) and touched down 2,300 feet from the threshold at 141 knots airspeed (VRef plus 13 knots), with a minus 1 foot per second vertical speed.  Immediately at touchdown, the spoilers were deployed.  Approximately 4 seconds later and 3,260 feet from the threshold (3,740 feet of landing distance remaining), the thrust reverser was fully deployed with engine 2 fan speed (N1) reaching about 100 percent 9 seconds later.  The airplane continued to roll down the runway with the thrust reverser deployed and exited the end of the runway at about 65 knots ground speed coming to a stop in the safety area approximately 268 feet from the end of runway 26.  The airport featured one ungrooved asphalt runway, Runway 8/26, which was 7,000 feet by 100 feet, and had a 1.25 percent downslope gradient to the west.  According to the airport/facilities directory, the airport remarks section notes, \"Runway 08-26 slick when wet, airport manager recommends landing uphill on runway 08 when able.\"  The accident airplane's flight manual does not provide any data on runway slope effect on the landing distance, therefore, the distances mentioned above would increase for landing on runway 26 which has a negative (down) 1.25 percent slope.  Since 2001, 12 business jet aircraft have experienced a runway overrun on runway 26.  All but one of the overruns included \"wet\" runway conditions.  Since the accident, the runway has been grooved and plans are proceeding with a runway improvement project.",

The mechanic reviewed the handwritten checklist the pilot used to start the engine and informed him that the procedures were out of sequence, which was most likely the cause of the hot start.  The pilot then motored the engine and allowed the starter to cool for approximately two minutes before he attempted to start the engine.  The engine started, sounded \"normal\" and ran \"stable\" for approximately 30-45 seconds.  The pilot then shut down the engine, and no smoke or engine surging was observed.  The pilot dismounted the airplane and walked inside the terminal building with the female passenger.  The mechanic then informed the pilot that he should let the starter cool down for at least 30 minutes to 1-hour.  About an hour later, the pilot started the engine, and departed.

After liftoff, the airplane did not clear the 60/70-foot-high tree line located at the departure end of the runway, and impacted several trees before descending nose first into a residential backyard. A review of downloaded GPS data showed the airplane began its takeoff roll from the approach end of the runway. Approximately 34 seconds into the takeoff, the airplane had traveled about 1,788 feet laterally, over 3/4 of the runway length, and had climbed 5 feet above the airport elevation. The plotted data showed that the airplane completed a 10-degree right turn immediately after liftoff and continued to climb as it approached the tree line.

Passengers purchased tickets for the rides in the airport office. The rides were given concurrently with a Lions Club International charitable \u201cfly-in breakfast\u201d at the airport, which had been advertised in the local newspaper. According to a representative of the Lions Club, the air rides were a separate activity, and the money collected for the air ride tickets was not given to the charity (evidence indicates that the pilot retained the money). The accident flight was the fifth or sixth airplane ride the pilot gave that day. Videotapes of previous flights and of the beginning of the accident flight indicated that the pilot was performing nonstandard takeoffs. Rather than beginning a normal climb after lifting off from the ground, the pilot would maintain an altitude just above treetop level until reaching the departure end of the runway, at which point he would initiate a steep pitch-up maneuver followed by a pushover maneuver. Also, a witness, who was a pilot, reported that the accident pilot commonly performed a nonstandard maneuver called a \u201cbuttonhook turn\u201d to align the airplane with final approach for landing. The maneuver involved flying the airplane at an altitude of about 300 feet above ground level perpendicular to the final approach course and then executing a 270-degree turn to the final approach. The witness stated that he observed the pilot perform this maneuver during one of the passenger-carrying flights preceding the accident flight.About 30 minutes after the airplane departed on the accident flight, witnesses observed it returning to the airport. Witnesses near the accident site reported that the airplane was flying at a low altitude toward the runway when it banked, descended, and impacted the ground. One witness stated that the airplane \u201cappeared to be flying very slow, almost on the edge of a stall.\u201d This witness heard the engine \u201cthrottle up\u201d and observed the airplane stall, with the left wing \u201cdipping,\u201d and then descend below the tree line.The accident site was about 0.75 mile east of the approach end of runway 27. Ground scarring and wreckage distribution covered a relatively small area, consistent with an accident due to an aerodynamic stall. Examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. During a test cell run, the airplane\u2019s engine performed within the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Review of the pilot\u2019s personal medical records indicated that he had been treated for age-related macular degeneration in both eyes for over 2 years. About 3 weeks before the accident, his distant visual acuity without correction was recorded as 20/200 for each eye. On at least two occasions, the pilot\u2019s retinal specialist advised him not to drive. However, the pilot continued to drive and was involved in a traffic accident, in which he turned in front of an oncoming vehicle, 10 days before the aircraft accident. The pilot\u2019s visual deficiency would have made it difficult for him to decipher the readings on cockpit instruments and to distinguish objects on the ground. This lack of visual acuity increased the likelihood that the pilot would fly at an inappropriate speed or altitude, thus increasing the chances of a stall.About 1 year before the accident, the pilot applied for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airman Medical Certificate and provided false information about his eye condition (he did not report his visits to the retinal specialist). Even so, the pilot\u2019s visual deficiency, given its severity, should have been detectable during the vision examinations required before issuance of such an Airman Medical Certificate. However, the pilot's aviation medical examiner (AME) reported normal eye test results, including 20/20 uncorrected vision, and issued the pilot a second-class medical certificate. About 7 months after the accident, the FAA decertified the AME for improper issuance of medical certificates. The pilot\u2019s autopsy noted severe coronary artery disease, which could have increased the likelihood of a heart attack or abnormal heart rhythm, resulting in impairment or incapacitation. There was no evidence of such an event, but no such evidence would necessarily be expected if death occurred within a few minutes to an hour of the impairment or incapacitation. The pilot\u2019s personal medical records did not indicate coronary artery disease.Either the pilot\u2019s macular degeneration or his unrecognized coronary artery disease could have contributed to his failure to maintain control of the airplane. The NTSB could not conclusively determine whether either condition directly resulted in the accident. However, given the incompatibility of the pilot\u2019s vision deficiency with safe motor vehicle operation and the pilot\u2019s awareness of this, the pilot displayed extremely poor judgment in not only continuing to fly but in deciding to perform passenger-carrying flights. Furthermore, the pilot did not provide all of the required information on his most recent application for an Aviation Medical Certificate, and his AME did not adequately evaluate the pilot\u2019s eyesight.The passenger seated in the right front seat of the accident airplane was one of the accident pilot\u2019s former student pilots who purchased a ride in the airplane. He held a private pilot certificate, but did not hold a current Airman Medical Certificate. If the accident pilot had become incapacitated, it is possible this passenger could have taken control of the airplane. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether or not this passenger was manipulating the flight controls when the accident occurred.The local FAA flight standards district office had no records of any concerns raised or complaints about the pilot. Also, the FAA had no record of the pilot applying for a Letter of Authorization to conduct passenger-carrying flights for compensation or hire, which is required by 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 91.147 for all passenger-carrying flights not conducted under 14 CFR 91.146 (flights for the benefit of a charitable, nonprofit, or community event). Therefore, the FAA was unaware of, and provided no oversight of, the pilot\u2019s passenger-carrying flights.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain airplane control for an undetermined reason, which resulted in an inadvertent stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's poor judgment in continuing to fly with his severe visual deficiency. Also contributing to the accident was the aviation medical examiner\u2019s failure to accurately assess and report the pilot\u2019s visual deficiency."

He reported that as he increased collective pitch, the rotor rpm immediately drooped to 90 percent.  The low rotor rpm horn and light came on and the pilot fully lowered the collective.  He estimated that his altitude at that time was between 100 to 150 feet agl and his airspeed was about 60 knots.  He declared an emergency to the air traffic control tower and turned left toward an open area between terminals 5 and 6.  The pilot realized he might not have sufficient altitude to clear the terminal buildings, so he pulled collective pitch, which further decayed the rotor rpm but provided additional lift.  As he descended to his intended landing point, a twin-engine turboprop airplane turned into the ramp area and he veered to the right to avoid it.  He stated that he fully lowered the collective and realized that he'd have to perform a run-on landing with little or no flare.  He pulled all remaining collective pitch before impacting the ground.  The helicopter contacted the ground in a tail-low attitude, slid forward approximately 60 feet, and made a 180-degree turn.  The right front chin bubble shattered on impact.  Both landing gear skids were forced upward through the cabin.  The helicopter came to rest on its belly.  The pilot attempted to shut the engine off by rolling the throttle past the idle cutoff position but was not able to manipulate the throttle.  He turned off the fuel shutoff valve, generators, and battery.  The pilot stated that he had not experienced any problems with the helicopter prior to the accident.  The engine was removed and run in a test cell. Due to a breakdown of the test cell, the engine run could not be completed.  Immediately before the test cell failed, an uncommanded decrease in rpm was observed.  The fuel control unit and power turbine governor were removed and bench tested.  The static bench testing of the fuel control unit and power turbine governor indicated that both components were slightly out of calibration.  According to Rolls Royce, the irregularities noted on the power turbine governor were consistent with a high-time governor and/or impact or vibration damage.  The governor had 246.5 hours remaining before the next overhaul.  The Rolls Royce investigator reported that the discrepancies noted might result in a 2 percent increase or decrease of N2 rpm with a corresponding reduction or increase of the collective lever.  He stated that the fuel control discrepancies were insignificant deviations.  The engine was then transported to Scottsdale, Arizona, where a complete and normal run was accomplished. During the test run, several aggressive accelerations/decelerations were conducted with no discrepancies noted.  The test included: initial idle; seal run in to maximum power; five power point checks; governor droop; and a final idle setting.  The engine performance met all required specifications.  A copy of the performance data is appended to this file.  The power turbine governor was bench tested again by Allied Signal. ",

Metallurgical examination of the bearing pieces and of the fractured connecting rod bolt revealed overstress on the undamaged fracture surfaces, and features consistent with bending shear separation, respectively.  Metallurgical examination of the crankcase halves revealed brown to black deposists at all cylinder mounting surfaces; the deposits are consistent with corrosion and fretting products.  Additionally, fretting and polishing were noted in several areas of both crankcase halves.  The No. 2 main bearing saddle area was noted to be, \"...severely damaged with large rolled edges formed at the forward and rear edges....\"  The engine was rebuilt by Teledyne Continental Motors, on August 23, 1988, and installed in the airplane on October 1, 1988.  All cylinders were overhauled and installed on the engine on November 25, 1994; at that time the engine had accumulated a total time of approximately 986 hours since major overhaul.  Between October 1, 1988, and November 25, 1994, oil samples for analysis were taken 10 times; the oil analysis reports were not located in the maintenance records and were not available from the facility that performed the analysis.  There was no record of the repair and/or replacement of the Nos. 2 or 3 cylinders between the time the overhauled cylinders were installed in 1994, and the last entry in the logbook which was dated March 6, 2001.  At the time of the accident, the engine had accumulated approximately 548 hours since the overhauled cylinders were installed.",
            "probable_cause": "The improper installation of the cylinders by other maintenance personnel for failure to assure that the cylinders were properly torqued resulting in fatigue crack in the crankshaft, and crankshaft failure.  A finding in the investigation was fretting of both crankcase halves at several areas."

While climbing out after takeoff, the aircraft experienced a complete loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion, and the 'pilot' attempted to land on the south-bound lanes of Interstate Highway 5. While descending toward the highway, the aircraft collided with a set of four power lines that crossed the road about 40 feet above the highway surface. After impacting the power lines, the aircraft descended nose-first into the asphalt surface. The power lines were not illuminated, and at the time of the accident, a light drizzle was falling. The individual 'piloting' the aircraft had been issued a student pilot certificate about 16 years prior to the accident, but since the expiration of that certificate (two years later), no new certificate had been reissued.

He observed a ridge top airstrip where he had landed on several previous occasions, and saw that most of it was blown clear of snow. He overflew the airstrip, decided that it looked good, and made an uneventful landing. He walked around a bit, looked at snow depths, and then departed back to his home airport. During the takeoff roll, the airplane drifted too far to the right over what he thought was ground covered with light snow. It was actually a snow drift made from snow that had blown to the side of the ridge. The airplane started pulling to the right as a result of contact with the snow drift. The pilot still thought that the airplane would take off without difficulty, but the right main tire broke through the crust and dug in. The airplane nosed over onto the snow drift, resulting in substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage. ",

She transitioned to a localizer-only approach and continued. Night, instrument meteorological conditions prevailed with a 400-foot ceiling. She noticed that the airplane was \"high and fast\" on final approach, so she used speed brakes and flaps to slow the airplane and descend to the minimum descent altitude. As the airplane descended below the ceiling, she observed runway lights and attempted to land on the runway. The airplane landed long, departed the runway at the departure end, and struck an embankment before coming to rest.

Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the wing fuel tanks were not breached and showed little damage. During the recovery, it was noted that both wing tank fuel caps were loose from their respective fuel tank filler necks and hanging by their chains. No fuel was found within the tanks, nor was there a fuel smell around the immediate area. Fuel was noted in and drained from the fuel lines, a condition that in a carbureted engine would be inconsistent with a fuel exhaustion event.
