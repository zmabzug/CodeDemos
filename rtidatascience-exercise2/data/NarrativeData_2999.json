The destination airport was about 70 miles from the takeoff airport.  The pilot reported that while climbing through 5,600 feet msl, the right engine started running rough. The right engine's manifold air pressure (MAP) eventually dropped to 18 inches.  He did not secure the right engine since it was still producing some power, but he increased the left engine's MAP to 35 inches to compensate for the loss of power on the right engine.  He reported the airplane was approximately 25-30 miles from the departure airport, but the pilot continued the flight to the destination airport.  Approximately 20 miles from the destination airport the left engine began running rough and the left engine's MAP quickly dropped to 18 inches of MAP. The pilot executed a forced landing to a field about nine miles from the destination airport.  He reported, \"Assured that I could not make the airport, I secured both engines.  Simultaneously, [I] selected the best landing site I could see.\"  The pilot lowered the landing gear after securing both engines.  The airplane landed in the middle of a field and the landing gear collapsed during rollout.  The airplane skidded to a stop on its belly, receiving only minor damage.  The airplane was lifted up on its main landing gear by a crane and it was towed to the airport.  An inspection of the fuel system and engine revealed no anomalies.  The fuel tanks contained fuel and no contamination was found.   The left and right engines were started and an engine ground run revealed no anomalies on the left engine.  The right engine ran normally except the right engine could only develop 30-32 inches of MAP.  The oil line going to the right engine's waste gate differential control was capped off, and then the engine produced 40 inches of MAP.  The FAA approved a ferry flight.  The airplane departed and flew for 30 minutes in the local pattern prior to departing.  The flight continued to Denver without incident or any engine anomalies.

The buyer intended to examine and photograph the maintenance records then fly the airplane around the airport traffic pattern with the owner. However, the owner insisted that they fly the airplane before reviewing the maintenance records. Upon starting the airplane, the owner announced that he had just been informed by the mechanic of the airplane\u2019s inoperative tachometer but continued to taxi to the runway.Witnesses who observed the airplane\u2019s departure described the takeoff roll as \u201cslow\u201d and \u201canemic\u201d and stated that the airplane used almost the entire length of the runway to become airborne. The airplane climbed slowly to treetop height in a nose-high attitude and disappeared from view. Moments later, a large smoke plume appeared out of the trees a short distance beyond the airport boundary.A witness who was standing on his back porch facing northeast, about 1.5 miles from the airport, said the airplane appeared above the trees at the back border of his property, flying directly toward him, and that the sound of the engine was \"really loud.\" The airplane descended over his backyard and below the height of his one-story house in a 30-degree left bank. The airplane then pitched up, climbed over the house, and struck a tree and a construction dumpster in front of the house, where it burst into flames. The mechanic stated that the whereabouts of the maintenance records were unknown, but he provided a handwritten list of discrepancies he found and work he performed on the accident airplane, including 3 hours of disassembling and cleaning of the carburetor.Examination of the wreckage revealed that the mixture control cable was disconnected from the carburetor mixture control arm. The cable displayed a light coating of soot, with no damage or fraying of the cable. The cable grip hardware on the mixture control arm was also undamaged, and the cable grip hole was completely open and unobstructed by the cable grip hardware, indicating that the cable had been removed from the arm and had not been reattached before the flight.Although the owner and mechanic had represented the airplane to the buyer as airworthy with a completed annual inspection, they knew this was not the case, as the tachometer was inoperative; further, during a test flight 3 days before the accident, the engine would not produce full power. The pilot complained of the lack of engine power to the mechanic, but the mechanic stated he did nothing to troubleshoot the discrepancy because of the inoperative tachometer and further stated that he had not \u201csigned off\u201d the annual inspection in the maintenance records.",

It subsequently had a loss of tail rotor thrust. The pilot reduced engine power and made an autorotation to a park along the lakeshore. During landing flare, the helicopter yawed left as the pilot increased collective prior to touchdown.  He stated that the touchdown \"seemed smooth\" and was made on the aft-portion of the skids, but as the helicopter slowed the left yaw tendency increased. The helicopter rolled over and came to rest inverted at the completion of the run-on landing.  Examination of the helicopter revealed that the number-one tail rotor driveshaft hanger assembly had separated, resulting in a discontinuity of the tail rotor driveshaft. The machine bolt that held  the assembly together was not installed with the required cotter pin. Further examination of the hanger assembly revealed that the splined areas did not contain grease. The remaining tail rotor driveshaft hanger bearings were properly greased and assembled. The mechanic who worked on the helicopter reported that due to other workload items, the previous tail rotor driveshaft inspection was interrupted several times before he was able to complete all of the required tasks. To avoid inter-mixing the driveshaft components, he temporarily reassembled the hanger assemblies before working on other projects.  His intention was to disassemble each hanger bearing when he had the opportunity to complete the inspection. The mechanic stated that he must have forgotten to disassemble, inspect, and grease the number one hanger assembly.  At the time of the accident, the number one hanger assembly had accumulated about 33 hours since the inspection.",
            "probable_cause": "The in-flight separation of a tail rotor driveshaft hanger bearing due to inadequate maintenance performed by maintenance personnel.  Contributing to the accident was the inability to maintain directional control due to the lack of tail rotor thrust."

He reported that during the forced landing to a small lake, the airplane struck trees and landed short of the lake.  The airplane's wings received structural damage.  During interviews, the mechanic who removed the airplane's wings for transport, told the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) he didn't find any fuel in the wing fuel tanks.  Another mechanic who removed the airplane's engine told the IIC the fuel system, including the gascolator, was intact with no signs of fuel leakage.

The pilot was vectored onto final approach for an instrument landing system approach. Radar data showed that the airplane performed s-type turns; the pilot then reported to the local controller that he had \u201c...lost some gyros but I think we are getting it.\u201d When the airplane was about 1 mile from the approach end of the runway at 1,300 feet, the local controller cancelled the approach clearance because the airplane was too high and advised the pilot to fly runway heading and climb to 2,000 feet. Radar data indicated that the pilot turned toward an easterly heading without clearance from the controller.\u000b\u000bThe pilot was then instructed to maintain an easterly heading followed by a southwesterly heading (220 degrees) consistent with a downwind leg to fly parallel to runway 4. The pilot turned well past the southwesterly heading to a northwesterly heading, and was asked by the controller if he was having any problem with the airplane such that he was unable to fly assigned headings. The pilot advised the radar controller that he \u201c...currently [had] no gyro I think the best thing for me to climb a little bit and go to my alternate of ah Columbus or some point south.\u201d There was an adequate supply of fuel onboard to fly to his alternate airport, which at that time was under visual meteorological conditions with 10 miles visibility and a ceiling at 5,500 feet. As a result of the loss of gyros, the pilot was flying the airplane with a partial panel. The pilot was cleared to climb direct to his alternate airport; however, extensive heading and altitude deviations were noted during this portion of the flight, which was operating in  IMC. The radar controller asked the pilot if he was ok to which he replied, \u201cuh no im not okay right now.\u201d This verbiage and the fact that extensive altitude and heading deviations occurred were clear indications that an emergency situation existed; however, the controller did not recognize this and did not request the necessary information needed to offer assistance, as outlined in FAA Order 7110.65, 10-2-1. The controller later reported that he believed the gyro comment would have affected only the pilot\u2019s ability to maintain heading, thus, he did not believe the loss of gyros while in instrument conditions constituted an emergency.\u000b\u000bThe controller then asked the pilot if he wanted to land at the airport, and he answered, \u201cuh the best thing to\u201d; however, the communication was not finished. It is likely that the pilot was intending to tell the controller again that he wanted to go to his alternate airport. However, because the controller did not recognize the emergency, he continued to vector the pilot to land using an ILS approach. While  thbeing vectored, when the airplane was operating in IMC, major heading and altitude changes were noted; however, when the airplane was operating  at higher altitudes in VFR conditions, the pilot was able to maintain the airplane\u2019s assigned heading and altitude. The steady flight in VFR conditions should have been a cue to the controller that safe flight was possible in visual conditions; thus he should have encouraged the pilot to continue the flight to his alternate airport as the pilot had requested.\u000b\u000bInstead, the controller vectored the pilot to intercept the localizer, advised that the flight was about 4 miles from the final approach fix, and cleared the pilot to conduct an ILS approach. The pilot managed to fly onto final approach, but while in IMC conditions, rolled to the right and crashed inverted in a wooded area about 7.5 nautical miles from the approach end of the runway. Postaccident examination of the airframe and flights controls for roll, pitch, and yaw revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Examination of the power section of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction; one propeller blade exhibited \u201cS\u201d-bending consistent with the engine developing power at impact. No discrepancies were noted with the airport approach systems.\u000bExamination of the engine-driven vacuum pump, which operates the primary flight instruments consisting of the attitude indicator and directional gyro revealed fire damage to the shear shaft; however, no evidence of scoring of the interior surface of the housing was noted. Further, inspection of the gyroscopic flight instruments operated by the engine-driven vacuum pump revealed no evidence of rotational scoring; therefore, the engine-driven vacuum pump, which was about 3 years 4 months beyond the suggested replacement interval, was not operating at the moment of impact. This was consistent with the comment from the pilot that he had lost his gyro instruments. \u000b\u000bAlthough no determination could be made as to whether the pilot was instrument current, his inability to maintain control of the airplane while flying with a partial panel suggests he was not proficient in doing so;  he failed this criteria in April 2002 during his first instrument rating checkride.\u000b\u000bIn August 2004, in response to an NTSB recommendation, the FAA implemented national computer-based training to alert controllers of in-flight emergencies a pilot may encounter and the effect of the emergency. NTSB review of the current version of the CBI revealed it did not contain scenarios related to failures of the vacuum system or gyro flight instruments. Although the training provided to the controllers involved appeared to be inconsistent, it is unlikely that consistent training would have affected the outcome of the accident because specific mention of gyro malfunction was not a covered topic in the CBI training.\u000b\u000bAlthough the pilot had not declared an emergency, he had advised ATC personnel that he had lost his gyros, and that he was \u201cnot OK.\u201d Further, extensive altitude and heading excursions of the aircraft were noted, all of which were clear indicators that an in-flight emergency existed. Had any of the FAA controller personnel understood either by experience or training that the pilot\u2019s declarations or altitude and heading changes constituted an emergency, they could have declared an emergency for the pilot and obtained the necessary information required by section 10-2-1 of FAA Order 7110.65U, \u201cAir Traffic Control.\u201d Had that occurred, it is likely the pilot would have been vectored to an airport with VFR conditions for an uneventful landing.\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the instrument-rated pilot to maintain control of the airplane while in instrument meteorological conditions after reporting a gyro malfunction. Contributing to the accident was the loss of primary gyro flight instruments due to the failure of the vacuum pump, the inadequate assistance provided by FAA ATC personnel, and the inadequate recurrent training of FAA ATC personnel in recognizing and responding to in-flight emergency situations."

After checking the fuel quantity, the pilot initially had the passenger order fuel but subsequently decided to forego the order once he determined its arrival would be delayed. The passenger confirmed that the fuel quantity sight gauge, located on top of the fuel tank forward of the front windshield, indicated a fuel level between the 10- and 15-gallon marks. After an uneventful engine runup, the pilot, flying from the rear seat, attempted a takeoff. However, after adding power, the engine began to run roughly, and the pilot aborted the takeoff. The pilot performed another engine runup and then took off with no additional anomalies noted. About 25 minutes after engine start, the pilot made an approach to a private airstrip for landing but then opted to go around. During the go-around, witnesses heard the engine lose power, regain it, and lose power again. The pilot checked that the fuel selector was in the \"Reserve\" position, the magnetos were on, and the carburetor heat was off. The airplane then descended into a corn field and nosed over after landing, coming to rest inverted. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no preexisting mechanical anomalies and no fuel in the fuel tank; however, the fuel sight gauge on top of the fuel tank was broken, and likely allowed any remaining fuel to drain out of the tank when the airplane was upside down. Before-landing procedures called for the fuel selector to be moved from the \"Main On\" position to the \"Reserve\" position, which would have allowed the bottom 3 gallons of the 24-gallon fuel tank to flow to the engine. However, the fuel selector valve was found in the \"Main On\" position, and damaged wreckage surrounding it confirmed that it was in that position upon ground impact. Pilot operating manual fuel consumption rates indicate scenarios where the available 9 gallons could have been consumed during the flight. However, exact consumption rates for the profile flown could not be determined, and the passenger, who was sitting in the front seat, stated that he saw between 5 gallons and 10 gallons of fuel indicated on the sight gauge when engine power was lost.Engine anomalies occurred twice after the pilot added power: during the initial takeoff attempt, and again during the go-around attempt.

A hand-held aviation Garmin GPS III was found in the \"ON\" position at the site of the accident.  The recorded track data indicated the airplane flew north and flew over or near five airports.  The track data indicated about 2 hours and 18 minutes elapsed during the portion of the flight recorded by the GPS.  A witness near the accident site reported, \"I observed what appeared to be an airplane flying in a north west direction at a low altitude.  It appeared as the airplane was losing altitude.  I lost sight of the airplane behind some trees at a distance.  At that time I did not hear engine noise from an airplane.  After several seconds passed I heard a loud crashing noise.\"  Less than one gallon of fuel was found in the left and right fuel tanks. No fuel was found in the engine fuel lines, fuel pump, or carburetor bowl.  The inspection of the airplane revealed no preexisting anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.  Emergency responders reported that a 750 ml bottle of vodka was found in the cockpit with about 1/4 of it gone.  The toxicology report indicated that pilot's ethanol blood level was almost 5 times the legal limit for presumed intoxication in most states.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The flight crew was conducting a straight-in ILS approach during instrument meteorological conditions with reported cloud ceilings about 100 feet above the decision height. During the descent into the terminal area and initial approach, tailwinds of up to 100 knots were affecting the flight and the crew reported feeling rushed because of the high ground speed. The crew did establish the airplane on the approach course at the proper speed and altitude, however they did not perform a complete approach briefing. The first officer (FO) was the pilot flying, and had very little instrument approach experience in the CRJ-200. Prior to making visual contact with the runway, the FO disengaged the autopilot and flight director, but only mentioned the autopilot in his verbal callout. At the time of the accident, there was no prohibition against making a raw data approach to minimums in the Air Wisconsin (AWAC) flight manual. Subsequently, the airplane drifted left of course and above the glidepath. As the airplane deviated from the approach course the flight was outside stabilized approach criteria, and as the airplane descended beneath the ceiling, both pilots noticed the deviation and misalignment with the runway.At this point, the captain offered to take over control of the airplane and salvage the landing instead of abandoning the approach and executing a missed approach. At the time of the accident, Air Wisconsin procedures provided the crews latitude in determining when a go-around was necessary.As the captain took control of the airplane, the FO misunderstood a statement by the captain and reduced power to idle without the captain\u2019s knowledge. The airplane developed a high sink rate and during the flare likely stalled, impacting the runway at a high vertical rate. The forces developed during the flare and touchdown exceeded the certified limit loads of the landing gear and the gear support trunnion fractured as intended. There was no evidence of any pre-existing damage to the gear components, and the fracture and gear separation occurred as designed.During his postaccident interview, the FAA aircrew program manager discussed the circumstances of some AWAC new-hire pilots who did not successfully complete initial training. Specifically, the FAA official stated that AWAC had changed the simulator time requirements for these pilots because they had completed a type rating course (provided by another training program) before starting AWAC\u2019s training program. AWAC determined that these pilots needed fewer hours of simulator time than other new-hire pilots. However, according to the FAA official, these pilots had high initial operating experience times and \u201cweren\u2019t getting it, so [AWAC] let them go.\u201d It is possible that these pilots might have performed better if they had been more thoroughly trained by the company.  A captain who was also a CL-65 flight instructor stated that, because of constraints with simulator time, all pilots needed to complete their training during the time that had been scheduled.  The director of flight training stated that the simulator, at full utilization, provided 600 hours of training per month, but that the company needed 1,000 hours of simulator training per month. The amount of IOE time provided to new-hire FOs had significantly increased because AWAC had not revised its simulator training to accommodate the needs of pilots with little or no jet experience. As a result, IOE had to be routinely extended beyond the FAA\u2019s requirement.  Since many simulator training scenarios cannot be accomplished in an airplane, particularly during passenger carrying flights, IOE is not an adequate substitute for simulator training exercises. Further, new-hire FOs who completed AWAC\u2019s initial training program were subject to a 1-year probation period. However, unlike other 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 operators, AWAC did not effectively conduct a program to assess the performance of probationary pilots. The accident FO\u2019s training and checkrides did not reveal his weaknesses with automation, pacing, and crew coordination, which rendered him unprepared to properly execute the approach into Providence during the accident flight. In addition, captains did not produce trip reports after flying with first officers, and, according to the Norfolk base manager, meetings to discuss probationary FO\u2019s progress during their first year were no longer held because the base managers were \u201ctoo busy.\u201d Thus, two potential methods to identify FOs\u2019 weaknesses were not used by AWAC.Because the first officers hired by AWAC in the 2 years preceding this accident had decreased levels of experience, these first officers would have benefited from additional training and oversight. However, AWAC\u2019s training program was ineffective because it did not accommodate these needs. The FAA\u2019s Principal Operations Inspector (POI) was based in Des Planes, Illinois, but AWAC\u2019s primary training center was in Charlotte, NC. The POI stated that providing oversight of AWAC was difficult because of the required travel. Because of the limited on-site oversight of AWAC\u2019s training program of new first officers, the FAA did not identify the shortcomings of AWAC\u2019s program in preparing these less experienced first officers for flying in high-performance jet airplanes.",
            "probable_cause": "the captain\u2019s attempt to salvage the landing from an instrument approach which exceeded stabilized approach criteria, resulting in a high sink rate, likely stall, and hard landing which exceeded the structural limitations of the airplane.Contributing to the accident was the first officer\u2019s poor execution of the instrument approach, and the lack of effective intra-cockpit communication between the crew. Additional contributing factors to the accident are the lack of effective oversight by AWAC and the FAA to ensure adequate training and an adequate experience level of first officers for line operations."

Within minutes the pilot radioed a mayday call and radio communications were lost. Ground witnesses reported that the airplane's engine was backfiring and sputtering.  The airplane was seen at a low altitude, in a left bank, when the left wing struck a tree (discolored foliage was observed near the tree).  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the left fuel tank was breached, and no fuel was observed in the tank.  The right fuel tank was not breached, and less then 1/2 gallon of fuel was drained from the tank.  The fuel selector was found on the 'right' tank, and the electric fuel pump switch was found in the 'OFF' position.  The last known fueling of the airplane was on 8/26, with 50 gallons of fuel.

During that time, he had conducted unspecified repairs and other maintenance on the airplane and had also flown it. The pilot did not hold a Federal Aviation Administration repairman certificate.During the personal flight, the engine experienced a sudden and complete loss of power. Because the airplane was over a suburban neighborhood, the pilot conducted a forced landing in a park. The airplane subsequently struck a light pole and an embankment. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the fuel lines were clear flexible plastic and that an in-line fuel filter was installed between the firewall and the carburetor. When first examined, the fuel line between the filter and the carburetor contained a kinked bend of about 90 degrees, which effectively choked the fuel line and prevented fuel from reaching the carburetor. The filter moved easily with very light force, and when moved manually about an inch fore and aft, the fuel line kinked and unkinked. Although the engine was not started due to the damage to the airplane, the engine turned over easily when the pull starter was activated.",

The fracture was located below the threads for the mast nut and above the bearing journal for the upper mast bearing. Postaccident examination of the fracture surface revealed multiple fatigue cracks that initiated at the outer diameter of the mast and extended through about 50 percent of the mast's cross section. The fatigue initiation areas and the through-the-wall portion of the fatigue were heavily corroded with extensive pitting and dark deposits visible. A dark oily material was found on the mast's outer surface near the fracture, and the mast's surface was severely corroded on both sides of the fracture. Analysis of samples of the dark oily material suggests that it was a mixture of lubricating oil and water.When the mast is installed on the helicopter, the location where the corrosion and fracture occurred is hidden. To fully inspect the area, the mast assembly must be removed from the helicopter and completely disassembled. Maintenance records indicated that the most recent overhaul of the main rotor mast was completed 2,499 hours before the accident, about 99 hours beyond the helicopter manufacturer's recommended time between overhaul of 2,400 hours.The NTSB has previously investigated a similar main rotor mast failure on the same make and model helicopter; in that case, the most recent overhaul of the main rotor mast was completed 1,486 hours before the accident.

He completed a waiver, but indicated he did not recall having a conversation with personnel of the FBO about the aircraft voltage requirement. Personnel of the FBO indicated the external power cart they used has a minimum voltage of 28 volts, and they asked the pilot if his aircraft's electrical system was 28 volts, to which he replied yes. A passenger remained outside the airplane, while the pilot was inside the airplane and a ground power unit (GPU) with a minimum of 28 volts was connected to the external power receptacle. The pilot indicated that he told the line service person to turn on power and he noticed that the alternator circuit breaker tripped. An individual from the (FBO) heard a bang and saw smoke coming from the airplane. The passenger who was outside the airplane later told the pilot that the line service person was frozen, but he was able to disconnect the (GPU) from the airplane, and in doing so noted arcing.

The pilot responded by lowering the collective control and increasing throttle but then determined that an airport landing could not be completed because the helicopter had already lost altitude. The pilot selected a forced landing area in a sand pit and responded to another low rotor rpm alarm by again lowering the collective. She attempted to cushion the landing with the available rotor rpm, but the helicopter landed hard, and the main rotor blades severed the tailboom. Examination of the helicopter revealed that the engine had a stuck (open) number 5 exhaust valve caused by buildup of oil carbon deposits. This is an issue with the Robinson Helicopters if the engine is not cooled down properly after flight. Air tour operations seem to be prone to carbon buildup mainly due to quick multiple shutdowns. The operator has established a postflight cool down procedure to prevent further problems. On January 19, 1988, Textron Lycoming published Service Letter No. L197A, Recommendations to Avoid Valve Sticking. The guidance offered included, \"Rapid engine cool down from low power altitude changes, low power landing approach and/or engine shutdown too soon after landing or ground runs should be avoided.\"",

Following that time, he started the engine in order to relocate the helicopter to the south side of the airport.  While air taxiing, he suddenly saw the boost pump caution light illuminate followed by the engine out light and low rpm warning lights.  He performed an autorotation on the south taxiway.  According to the passenger, while flying 10 feet above ground level the engine seemed to start losing power.  The pilot maneuvered the helicopter into the wind while descending, and further reported that when the helicopter contacted the ground, the main rotor blade contacted the tailboom causing separation of it.  The pilot then secured the helicopter and asked if he was OK.  Both exited the helicopter, and rescue personnel assisted them promptly.  The passenger also stated that the total flight time was approximately 20-30 seconds, and at no time did he perceive any visual or audio alarms, but he is not familiar with the helicopter or its systems.  According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector-in-charge (IIC) who examined the accident site and helicopter, and also talked with the pilot, the pilot reported to him that the purpose of the flight was to reposition the helicopter for fuel.  The pilot reported to the FAA-IIC that during his preflight inspection, the fuel gauge indicated greater than 10 gallons of fuel.  Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed less than one ounce of fuel was drained from the fuel tank, and approximately 1 liter of fuel was drained from the fuel filter canister.  The fuel quantity gauge was tested and was found to indicate correct when fuel was added in five gallon increments; a total of 15 gallons were added during the test.",

One of the cracks was within the underside wing skin below a doubler, and the other was within the doubler itself.  The total size and origin of the fatigue regions could not be determined due to damage to fracture surfaces and a lack of available material. The airplane was delivered new to the U.S. Air Force in December 1957 and was retired from military service in 1986.

He said that as soon as the descent was initiated he experienced unusual engine noises and an abrupt loss of engine power.  He lowered the collective and applied full power, but received no indication of engine power.  He then initiated an autorotation to landing on a field with a 30-degree slope.  Upon landing, the aircraft rolled over and came to rest on its port side causing the rotor to impact the tail boom. Examination of the engine showed evidence that the engine had seized during flight. Inspection of the fuel metering system showed that the accident airplane had not complied with Revolution Helicopter Service Information Letter number 042696, which requires the original factory carburetor jet setting to be adjusted to insure that the EGT be between 1,000 and 1,150 degrees Fahrenheit.  No engine coolant was found in the coolant tank and the coolant hose tee was found to be deformed and leaking fluid. ",
            "probable_cause": "Loss of engine power due to loss of engine cooling fluid.  Related factors were maintenance service bulletin not complied with by the owner/pilot mechanic resulting in low output of the carburetor, and unsuitable terrain. "

The accident pilot, who reported that he had 17,000 flight hours and 7,000 hours in the make and model of the accident airplane, said that southeasterly winds had begun to increase while he was waiting at the bay for the passengers to return from the tour. He said that, unlike when he had landed about 2.5 hours earlier, it was no longer \u201cnice and calm\u201d when the passengers returned. The pilot noticed choppy waves in parts of a nearby cove. To avoid some of the wind and waves, the pilot elected to take off toward the interior of the bay, in the direction of rising terrain. The pilot said that he had never taken off in that direction before. The pilot also said that he had intended to make a shallow, right-climbing turn toward the mouth of the bay and away from the terrain, but shortly after takeoff, he saw numerous choppy waves concentrated along his proposed departure flightpath, which he said indicated to him that strong winds were likely along that path. The pilot decided to change his plan and continue flying straight temporarily, away from the waves, and to make a left, 180-degree turn inside the bay, which was surrounded by high terrain. The pilot indicated that when the turn was initiated, the airplane was about 400 feet above the water, and he did not recall the indicated airspeed. The attempted 180-degree turn was within the airplane\u2019s performance capabilities but placed it closer to rising terrain. While attempting this turn, the pilot encountered a downdraft, was unable to climb above the terrain, and stalled the airplane about 60 feet above the ground. The downdraft likely made it more difficult to avoid descending into the rising terrain. A weather study by the National Transportation Safety Board confirmed that there was a gust front in the area and an abrupt wind change about the time of the accident. Pilots flying nearby also reported low-level windshear, strong winds, and turbulence. No mechanical anomalies were discovered during postaccident inspections by the Safety Board.",

The pilot and two passengers sustained serious injuries and two passengers sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to DLM Holding Group LLC and operated by the pilot under the provisions of the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed. The flight departed the Southwest Michigan Regional Airport (BEH), Benton Harbor, Michigan, about 0730 eastern daylight time. The pilot reported that he departed BEH and overflew Kenosha, Burlington, Hartford, Ripon, and Fisk, Wisconsin. He then proceeded to fly the Fisk arrival procedures for runway 27 which were in use per the notice to airmen (NOTAM) for the EAA AirVenture 2015 air show at OSH. The pilot reported that he entered the right downwind leg for runway 27 at 1,800 ft and started to descend while maintaining 90 kts airspeed. He reported that he was instructed by air traffic control (ATC) to turn onto the base leg abeam the runway numbers and to land on the green dot (located about 2,500 ft from the runway 27 displaced threshold). After he started the base turn, he observed a twin-engine airplane taxi onto runway 27 and start its takeoff roll. The pilot reported that ATC instructed him to continue the approach and land on the orange dot (located about 1,000 ft from the runway 27 displaced threshold) instead of the green dot. The pilot continued the approach and about 250 to 300 ft above ground level, he pulled back on the power which resulted in the airplane entering a stall. The pilot attempted to recover by adding full power, but the airplane impacted the runway in a right wing, nose down attitude. Witnesses reported seeing the airplane during the downwind to base turn and enter a steep angle of bank with the right wing down. The right wing hit the runway which resulted in an explosion and fire with black smoke rising above the accident site. The right wing separated from the airplane and landed in the grass on the south side of the runway. The airplane skidded on its belly and came to rest on the left side of the runway about 250 ft from the initial impact point. The left wing was partially separated from the fuselage. A postimpact fire ensued on the separated right wing and under the partially separated left wing.The pilot, the two passengers who were sitting in the middle seats, and the passenger sitting in the rear seat exited the airplane with some assistance from people who were near the accident site. The Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) personnel arrived at the scene and used foam to put out the fire. The passenger sitting in the copilot's seat was extracted from the wreckage by the CFR. All five survivors were taken to local hospitals for treatment.

He then raised the manually operated landing gear but had difficulty securing the gear retraction handle in the down (gear up and locked) position.  During this event he became distracted with securing the gear in the up and locked position and the aircraft transitioned to a nose high and slow airspeed condition. A witness observed the aircraft reaching no more than 40-50 feet in altitude and rolling left.   The pilot recognized this condition and pitched the nose down to increase airspeed.  The aircraft impacted off the left side of the runway with its right wing, skidding across the runway and coming to rest on the south side of the runway; and the right wing displayed aft and upward bending with 45 degree scratch markings on its underside.  Post crash examination revealed the gear retracted but not in the up and locked position.  Wings level stall speed for a takeoff flap setting (15 degrees) in the M20E was documented in the Owner's Manual as 64 MPH.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain adequate flying airspeed resulting in a stall/mush condition and loss of control at low altitude.  A contributing factor was the pilot's distraction from flying the aircraft while attempting to retract the landing gear."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various sources and may not have traveled in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft incident report.The airplane, being operated on a scheduled passenger flight, contacted the runway with the left wing tip, following a loss of control while landing.  Weather conditions were varying due to freezing fog that was moving into and out of the area.  The control tower at the destination airport was closed and the airplane was being controlled by a near-by approach control facility.  After holding in-flight to wait for the weather to improve, the crew began the instrument landing system (ILS) approach when the visibility was reported as one-half mile.   The captain stated that almost immediately upon entering the top of the fog layer they received an ICE caution message.  He stated they turned on the wing and engine inlet anti-ice, but the ice accumulation on the windshield wipers was rapid and ice was accumulating on the winglet.  The captain stated the approach lights came into sight when they were just above minimums and that he had the runway in sight at approximately 140 feet above the ground.  The first officer then disconnected the autopilot and the nose came up slightly.  He stated he informed the first officer to keep the nose down and add thrust.  The captain stated they were slightly left of the centerline and the first officer was making \"small\" corrections back to the right.  He stated the airspeed was just inside the \"bottom of the bucket\" and the trend vector was indicating a decrease in airspeed.  The captain stated he \"again said something about more thrust and keeping the nose down.\"  He stated the airplane continued to move to the right of the centerline and he took control of the airplane.  He stated the airplane responded \"poorly\" feeling \"heavy and sluggish.\"  The captain stated the airplane was close to the right side of the runway and he added thrust at which time the ailerons became more responsive.  He stated the left wing dropped, scraping the runway, at about the same time the left main gear touched down.  The captain stated the airplane bounced into the air then landed hard on the runway.  The crew then taxied the airplane to the gate.  The first officer stated that when the captain reported having the runway in sight, she transitioned her sight outside of the airplane and realized she needed to correct to the right.  She stated she began the correction at which time the nose of the airplane pitched up, the airplane veered toward the correction, and it started sinking toward the right side of the runway.  She stated the captain took over the controls, but the airplane dropped to the runway, bounced, and touched down harder the second time.  The first officer, who was flying the approach, had about 15 hours of total flight time in the CL-600.  The captain, who was also a check airman, had a total of 1,196 hours of flight time in the CL-600.  At the time of the accident the local weather was reported as being visibility 1/4 mile in freezing fog, vertical visibility 100 feet.  Inspection of the airport and airplane on the afternoon following the incident revealed ice was still visible on the antennas, windshield wipers, radome, winglets, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers.  The main body of ice on these structures measured between one-half to five-eights of an inch thick and that the main body of ice plus the \"ice spines\" totaled three-quarters of an inch thick.  A Kinematic parameter extraction showed loss of lift consistent with airframe icing but there was no early stall due to icing prior to touchdown and no indication that airframe icing had caused any loss of control.   Marks on the ground and on the runway revealed the airplane initially touched down 1,976 feet from the approach end of the runway with the right main landing gear in the grass off the side of the runway.   The left wing tip then left a 63-foot long scrape mark on the runway, which was followed about 1,100 feet later by another set of tire marks.  Data from the flight data recorder showed the airplane rolled slightly to the left followed by a roll to the right when the autopilot was disengaged.  It then showed the airplane touched down with a vertical acceleration of at least 1.8g's.  The airplane then became airborne in a 16-degree left bank, with a 5-degree nose up pitch at which time the ground and flight spoilers deployed contributing to the firmness of the 3.25 g touchdown one second later.",
            "probable_cause": "The copilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during the landing and the captain's delay in initiating remedial action.  Factors contributing to the accident were the low ceiling and low visibility due to fog, and the aircraft's deviation from expected performance due to airframe icing."

The mechanic told the pilot to fly it around the airport traffic pattern and then bring it back so he could do a compression check on the engine; the mechanic was unaware that the airplane was out of its annual inspection. The pilot conducted a preflight inspection of the airplane, started the engine, and prior to takeoff ran the engine up, noting that the magnetos were within tolerances. The pilot said that after taking off and initially climbing without incident, the engine began to lose rpms but was still running smoothly. The pilot stated that he then pushed the mixture in all the way, and soon thereafter the engine rpms were down to about 1,700 and the airplane was losing altitude. The pilot elected to make an emergency landing in a field. During the emergency landing the airplane sustained substantial damage to its left wing after impacting a berm. The airplane subsequently slid between 60 feet to 75 feet before coming to rest in an upright position. A postaccident examination of the engine revealed low compression on the No. 1 and No. 4 opposing cylinders, which most likely resulted in the partial loss of engine power. Because the worst compression readings were on cylinders on opposite sides of the engine, it may have run fairly smoothly but at a reduced power output. Additionally, the pilot\u2019s decision to position the mixture to full rich, coupled with a density altitude of almost 10,000 feet, could have contributed to the partial loss of power. While a review of a Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Carburetor Icing Probability Chart revealed \"Icing - glide power\" for the reported temperature and dew point conditions, the investigation could not definitively identify carburetor ice as the reason for the power loss.",

He heard on the frequency a controller advise for a \"white low wing\" airplane to turn base two times.  He was not sure the controller was referring to his airplane due to the fact that he could not slow down to landing speed on a short base to final from his position, and he \"surmised\" the controller was not referring to his airplane.  He continued on the downwind leg thinking he was going to land on runway 09 (9R), turned base, then while on final approach to runway 9R, he noted activity at the middle of the field and noted airplanes departing from that runway.

During the third and last circle, the airplane pitched nose up, decelerated, then pitched nose down steeply and descended toward the ground. The airplane then rotated to the left with its nose still pointed down, turned about 180 degrees from its original direction of travel, then disappeared from view. Moments later the sound of an impact was heard.Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any evidence of preimpact malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.Toxicological testing of the pilot revealed the presence of carbon monoxide in his blood; however, the carbon monoxide level was consistent with a heavy smoking habit. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (marijuana) was also detected in his lungs but not in his blood, and THC corboxylic acid was detected in his urine, liver, and lungs. However, the THC findings were consistent with a remote usage of marijuana (that is, not immediately before flight), and the absence of THC in his blood indicated that the pilot was likely not impaired.
