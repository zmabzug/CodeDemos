The flight was then smooth until descent to about 1,200 feet above ground level, when conditions became \"bumpy.\" Upon entering the traffic pattern for runway 24, the pilot increased normal approach airspeed by 10 knots in anticipation of gusty headwinds on final approach. The approach then proceeded \"normally\" until short final, when the glider encountered a \"rogue\" wind gust that \"violently\" rolled it about 90 degrees to the right, heading it away from runway centerline. By the time the pilot was able to level the wings, the glider was too low, necessitating an off-airport landing into small trees that resulted in left wing spar damage.

The aircraft went off the runway to the left and crashed coming to rest upright.  A post crash fire erupted and destroyed the aircraft.  The mechanic-rated passenger stated he was observing the right engine gauges during this maintenance test flight and did not observe any over torque indications.  When he looked up from the instruments at about the time the aircraft should lift off, the aircraft was drifting to the left.  The pilot, who was looking at the engine instruments, looked up, saw the aircraft was about to drift off the runway, and retarded both power levers.  The passenger/mechanic (who was also a pilot) reported that the pilot placed the propellers in reverse.  Six thousand feet of runway remained at the abort point. The aircraft pitched up and then crashed on the left wing and nose. Cessna Service Newsletter SLN99-15 and AlliedSignal Operating Information Letter OI 331-17 report an abnormality that may affect the model engine in which an uncommanded engine fuel flow increase or fluctuation may occur, resulting in an unexpected high torque and asymmetric thrust.  The condition is associated with an open torque motor circuit within the engine fuel control.  A system malfunction resulting in engine acceleration to maximum power would produce an overtorque of about 2,288 foot-pounds (ft-lb).  This power output is restricted by a fuel flow stop in the engine fuel control.  Normal takeoff power is 1,669 ft-lbs; therefore, one engine accelerating to the stop limit while one engine continued to operate normally would cause a torque differential of 619 ft-lbs.  The total loss of power in one engine during takeoff while one engine continued to operate normally would result in a torque differential of 1,669 ft-lbs.  The Cessna 441 Flight Manual states that at 91 knots indicated airspeed, the airplane is controllable with one engine inoperative (that is, with a torque differential between engines of up to 1,669 ft-lbs). However, if an electronic engine control failure occurs on one engine and the other engine is retarded to idle, the fuel flow to the failed engine will not be reduced, and a torque differential of about 2,288 ft-lbs will occur, at which point the airplane is uncontrollable by the pilot.",
            "probable_cause": "Failure of the electronic engine control, which caused an overtorque condition in the right engine that made directional control of the airplane not possible by the pilot when the power to the left engine was retarded to idle during the takeoff roll."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The unmanned aircraft (UA), a Predator B, collided with the terrain following a loss of engine power while patrolling the southern U.S. border on a Customs and Border Protection (CPB) mission.The UA's takeoff was delayed due to the inability to establish a communication link between the UA and Pilot Payload Operator (PPO)-1 console during initial power-up. After troubleshooting the problem, an avionics technician switched the main processor cards between PPO-1 and PPO-2. Personnel who were maintaining the unmanned aircraft system (UAS) stated there were very few spare parts purchased with the UAS, which is why they switched the main processor cards instead of replacing the card in PPO-1. The link was subsequently established, and the flight was initiated.The flight was being flown from a ground control station (GCS), which contained two nearly identical control consoles: PPO-1 and PPO-2. Normally, a certified pilot controls the UA from PPO-1, and the camera payload operator (typically a U.S. Border Patrol agent) controls the camera, which is mounted on the UA, from PPO-2. Although the aircraft control levers (flaps, condition lever, throttle, and speed lever) on PPO-1 and PPO-2 appear identical, they may have different functions depending on which console controls the UA. When PPO-1 controls the UA, movement the condition lever to the forward position opens the fuel valve to the engine; movement to the middle position closes the fuel valve to the engine, which shuts down the engine; and movement to the aft position causes the propeller to feather. When the UA is controlled by PPO-1, the condition lever at the PPO-2 console controls the camera's iris setting. Moving the lever forward increases the iris opening, moving the lever to the middle position locks the camera's iris setting, and moving the lever aft decreases the opening. Typically, the lever is set in the middle position.Console lockup checklist procedures indicate that, before switching operational control between the two consoles, the pilot must match the control positions on PPO?2 to those on PPO-1 by moving the PPO-2 condition lever from the middle position to the forward position, which keeps the engine operating. The pilot stated in a postaccident interview that, during the flight, PPO-1 locked up, so he switched control of the UA to PPO-2. In doing so, he did not use the checklist and failed to match the position of the controls on PPO-2 to how they were set on PPO-1. This resulted in the condition lever being in the fuel cutoff position when the switch to PPO-2 was made, and the fuel supply to the engine was shut off. With no engine power, the UA began to descend. The pilot realized that the UA was not maintaining altitude but did not immediately identify that the condition lever was in the fuel cutoff position. The pilot and avionics technician decided to shut down the entire system and send the UA into its lost-link profile, which is a predetermined autonomous flightpath, until they could figure out what the problem was. After the system was shut down, the UA descended below line of sight (LOS), and communications could not be reestablished. The UA began to fly its lost-link profile as it descended to impact with the terrain.When the UA lost engine power, it began to operate on battery power. On battery power, the UA began to shed electrical equipment to conserve electrical power. In doing so, electrical power to the transponder was shut down. This resulted in air traffic control not being able to detect a Mode C transponder return for the UA as it descended below the bottom of the temporary flight restricted airspace. The primary radar return was also lost when the UA descended below the LOS in the mountainous area.The investigation revealed a series of computer lockups had occurred since the CBP UAS began operating. Nine lockups occurred in a 3-month period before the accident, including 2 on the day of the accident before takeoff and another on April 19, 2006, 6 days before the accident. Troubleshooting before and after the accident did not determine the cause of the lockups. Neither the CBP nor its contractors had a documented maintenance program that ensured that maintenance tasks were performed correctly and that comprehensive root-cause analyses and corrective action procedures were required when failures, such as console lockups, occurred repeatedly.Review of the CBP's training records showed that the accident pilot had recently transitioned from flying the Predator A to flying the Predator B and had only 27 hours of Predator B flight time. According to the CBP, the pilot was given verbal approval to fly its Predator B with the caveat that the pilot's instructor would be present in the GCS when the pilot was flying. This verbal approval was not standard practice for the CBP. The instructor pilot was in another building on the airport and did not enter the GCS until after it was shut down and the UA entered the lost-link procedure.The investigation also revealed that the CBP was providing a minimal amount of operational oversight for the UAS program at the time of the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to use checklist procedures when switching operational control from PPO-1 to PPO-2, which resulted in the fuel valve inadvertently being shut off and the subsequent total loss of engine power, and lack of a flight instructor in the GCS, as required by the CBP's approval to allow the pilot to fly the Predator B. Factors associated with the accident were repeated and unresolved console lockups, inadequate maintenance procedures performed by the manufacturer, and the operator's inadequate surveillance of the UAS program."

The flight leader estimated that the formation was about 500 feet above the water, and a trail pilot estimated that the airplanes were about 2,000 yards apart. The formation was headed eastbound, along a beach. A video clip revealed that some of the airplanes completed aileron rolls. When the number 5 airplane attempted a left aileron roll, it reached a 180-degree (completely upside down) position with the nose dropping to about 10 degrees below the horizon. As the airplane continued through about 225 degrees, at an estimated 15-degrees nose low attitude, it began a turn to the right while still continuing the left roll. As the airplane reached a southerly heading, away from the beach, it passed through about 315 degrees of the left roll (right wing still 45-degrees down.) The roll suddenly reversed, the wings briefly went vertical (left wing up, right wing down), and the nose dropped, indicative of a stall. As the airplane continued rolling to the right, it appeared to go slightly inverted. It then descended into the water about 90-degrees nose low, with the top of the airplane facing the beach. The right wingtip was the first part of the airplane to strike the water, and as it did, the angle of the wings in relation to the horizon was about 45 degrees.

A precise weight and balance could not be calculated due to the thermal damage of several items, as well as an unmeasured amount of water intrusion to the remaining items.  Using 207.5 as an estimate for baggage on-board the airplane, two weight and balance calculations were constructed using 80 gallons of fuel and 40 gallons of fuel.

Post-accident examination of the engine revealed that the #3 cylinder's exhaust valve had failed.  Because of mechanical damage and oxidation to the fracture surfaces, the specific cause of the exhaust valve failure could not be precisely determined.  However, it was most likely related to overheating and non-uniform seating loads due to the severe wear and bell-mouthing of the valve guide.  The bent pushrods found during the examination also indicated some valve sticking in the guides prior to failure that caused excessive loads in the pushrods.  Valve stems and guides were normal wear items.  Mutual wear increased the stem to guide clearances and exhaust valves, particularly the sodium filled valves utilized in the accident engine, rely on proper clearance to the guide to maintain good heat transfer properties.  The most likely scenario for this failure was that the valve-to-guide clearance became so great as to impede heat transfer from the valve to the head through the guide.  The valve then overheated as indicated by the decreased stem hardness and radial head cracks found during the metallurgical examination.  Off center valve closure loads, due to the bell mouthing, then fractured the overheated and lower strength valve head.  In May 1992, the engine manufacturer issued a service bulletin (SB) recommending engine inspections to determine the wear condition of exhaust valve and guides.  The SB details procedures to assess the wear on the engine by wobbling the valve in the head.  The SB recommended performing this inspection every 300 hours on helicopter engines.  Engine logbooks only showed that the SB was complied with twice, once in January 2005, at 1,921.8 hours, and the last time in March 2005, at 2,204 hours total time.  The last inspection was only 133.3 hours prior to the accident.  The engine manufacturer reported that if performed properly this inspection method would have been successful in detecting excess valve wear.  The presence of extensive lead deposits on the valve stem and in the valve spring keeper groove indicated that stem to guide clearances were relatively large allowing the passage of combustion products for an extended period of time.  This suggests that the SB inspections were not performed properly.",

When the till was moved to the left, the nose wheel turned to the right.  When the till was centered, the nose wheel remained turned to the right.  When the till was moved to the right, the nose wheel turned further to the right.  Further electrical and hydraulic testing of the nose wheel steering system revealed that the steering handle potentiometer checked normally.  The rudder potentiometer was difficult to center with slightly erratic readings around the center.  The feedback potentiometer centered normally but had a small open reading at approximately the left 45-degree position.  All potentiometers were electronically centered and the airplane was jacked.  When hydraulic power was applied, the nose wheel turned slowly to the right reaching the seven-degree safety switch in approximately 4 to 5 seconds.  The seven-degree switch functioned normally, cutting off hydraulic power to the system.  The steering manifold was removed and replaced with a serviceable unit.  The same check was then performed with normal results. Detailed examination of the hydraulic manifold revealed that the only one valve responded when pressure testing the Electrohydraulic Servovalve (EHSV).The EHSV, serial number 748, was removed and replaced with a new EHSV, serial number 075A.  When pressure was applied to the unit, both pressure vent valves registered the same pressure.  The removed EHSV was then tested again at another facility with the same results.  The ESHV tear down revealed damage to an o-ring and a small piece of contamination was found blocking the C1 valve orifice .  Embraer published an Operational Bulletin on April 13, 2004, \"Nose Wheel Steering System Malfunction and Uncommanded Swerving Events.\"  The intent of the bulletin was to provide operators of the EMB-145, ERJ-140, and EMB-135 airplanes with procedures to be followed in the event of uncommanded swerving during high speed taxi, takeoff and landing.  The bulletin  stated that the steering handwheel should not be used to correct uncommanded swerving on the ground.  Additionally, Embraer called for the installation of a cockpit decal stating: \"WARNING:  DO NOT ACTUATE THE STEER HANDLE IN CASE OF UNCOMMANDED SWERVING OR INADVERTENT STEER INOP MSG.\"  The accident airplane did not have the decal installed at the time of the accident.  However, the time for accomplishment of the bulletin was \"within the next 150 flight hours or 4 months, whichever occurs first.\"  The bulletin was issued in April 6, 2004, and the incident occurred on June 11, 2004. ",
            "probable_cause": "The loss of pressure in Electrohydraulic Servovalve (EHSV) within the nose wheel steering manifold due to contamination in the C1 orifice of the valve, which resulted in an uncommanded turn of the nose wheel during landing rollout.  A contributing factor was the pilot's improper use of the steering handwheel when attempting to correct directional control during the landing roll."

The local authorities located the airplane the following day. Air traffic control records indicate that, during the accident flight, the pilot was operating under visual flight rules while receiving radar traffic advisory service from an air traffic controller. The air traffic controller noticed a potential conflict with a Boeing 757 and acted to maintain traffic separation by instructing the 757 pilot to maintain 8,000 feet, asking the accident pilot to maintain at or below 7,500 feet, and providing a wake turbulence cautionary advisory. The accident airplane was at 7,800 feet at the time, and the pilot advised that he was descending to comply with the controller\u2019s instructions. When the two aircraft were separated horizontally by about 1 to 2 miles, the accident pilot reported the 757 in sight.

It was noted that the selector could only be moved by lifting the selector handle, and then with a very forceful hand manipulation the selector was moved.  Further inspection noted that smooth transfer of the fuel selector valve was impeded by the round head Phillips retaining screws holding the fuel selector plate in place, instead of flush head type screws.  It was also noted that the fuel selector handle has a long rectangle shaped handle with the opposite side being short and with a pointer.  It is the short pointed end which depicts the position of the tank selected.

The pilot was also the owner/builder. He stated that while conducting some clearing turns in preparation for slow flight testing, he observed an oil pressure warning on the engine monitor. The indicated oil pressure was zero. He immediately turned toward the airport and reduced engine power to idle. About 60 seconds after the oil pressure warning, the engine lost power completely. The pilot established best glide airspeed and set up for a forced landing. He noted that he overshot the first field he had selected, but then settled on a second field. The airplane clipped two sets of trees during the approach and struck a wire fence during the landing. The pilot estimated that the airplane slid 20 feet after touching down. A postaccident inspection revealed a failure of an oil hose. Specifically, the return hose from the oil cooler had a 1-inch longitudinal split at a bend in the line.

A postaccident examination of the engine and the airframe revealed that the left exhaust muffler had separated at the forward seam, with evidence of sooting noted on the scat hoses surrounding the area.  It was also observed that the forward end cap and exhaust riser were separated from the main body of the muffler.  Magnified examinations found that almost all of the fractures were blackened and severely oxidized.  The failure of the muffler was the result of undetected oxidation and cracking resulting from normal thermal degradation.  The cracking would have allowed exhaust gases direct access to cabin air through the heater system.  Toxicological testing of the pilot and his passenger revealed carbon monoxide levels of 45 percent and 46 percent, respectively.",

Subsequently, the pilot reported that there was \"oil all over the windshield\" and that he was attempting a forced landing.  The airplane collided with trees in a densely wooded area.  No witnesses to the accident were identified.  During examination of the wreckage, oil was noted on the bottom of the fuselage, the inboard bottom skins of the left and right wings, and the tail surfaces.

Fretting was noted on the mating surfaces of the cylinder base flange and the crankcase deck (flat face around the cylinder bore) and on the mating surfaces of the crankcase halves.  Metallurgical examination of the 8 fasteners indicated they all separated due to fatigue cracking probably due to insufficient clamping force.  Insufficient clamping force can result from improper torque application at cylinder installation or from the clamped surfaces moving closer over time.  Fracture of the studs led to separation of the #2 cylinder from the crankcase and a loss of engine power.  Examination of the maintenance records showed that the engine had accumulated about 839 hours since a major overhaul approximately 13 years prior to the accident.

When he checked the weather, the temperature was 90 degrees and the calculated density altitude was approximately 7,000 feet. There was no wind, but an airport employee suggested using runway 35. Although the pilot had some difficulty starting the engine, all pre take-off checks were normal, and the airplane ran fine. During the taxi to runway 35, the pilot noticed that the wind was from 050 degrees at 15 knots, and he elected to use runway 17.

Following rotation, the airplane continued to accelerate, but would only climb approximately 20 to 25 feet above the runway. The pilot adjusted the mixture and attempted to add more power but the engine would not respond. With no runway remaining, he continued on the departure heading and made a forced landing in a field just past the end of the runway.

The case was previously identified under accident number DEN08FA130.The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was being demonstrated to the Air Force Academy for use in its aeronautics program. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was preflighted and taxied into position on a road for takeoff. The command for automatic takeoff was entered. The UAV then flew an automatic flight profile. After several demonstrated maneuvers, the UAV was directed to enter a rectangular traffic pattern for landing. During the first landing attempt, the UAV undershot the final turn waypoint. The internal pilot, who was in the control van on the ground, manually sent the UAV to the upwind waypoint to re-enter the traffic pattern for another landing attempt. During the second landing attempt, the UAV undershot the final turn again. The internal pilot again sent the aircraft to the upwind waypoint. On the third attempt, the airplane flew the base leg and overshot the final approach by about 89 feet before turning and descending sharply toward the landing point on the road. The UAV flew into the top of an 80-foot-tall stadium light that was displaced to the side of the road on which the aircraft was supposed to land. The UAV was destroyed in the impacts with the pole and the ground. The UAS had been flight tested to determine if the UAV could be operated in the confined airspace at the demonstration site.  Subsequently, programmed bank angle and descent angle values were increased based on flight testing before the flight demonstration. The autopilot recorded flight parameter data. An analysis of the recorded data showed that a strong tailwind, the high density altitude, and the increased bank angle contributed to the airplane\u2019s two undershoots.  Upon examining the recorded data for the incident flight and previous flight demonstrations, an anomaly was discovered where the UAV would enter a sideslip and momentarily lose control. The UAV would \u201cswing wide\u201d and fly relatively straight for a short period of time, then resume the programmed flight. The operator believes that this anomaly occurred on the third approach. The manufacturer had told the operator that the large tail wind on downwind, combined with the excessive speed due to the steep approach could have resulted in the vehicle to switch early to the base leg. They also said that the approach was too aggressive (too steep and too short) and the vehicle would have been constantly pulling max bank angle and then try to correct upright. The vehilce could not adjust fast enough to satisfy the aggressive approach which resulted in the aircraft being unable to fly the proper ground track.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight team's failure to program the UAS with flight-tested parameters that could tolerate the high density altitude and tailwind conditions encounted during the flight, which resulted in two undershoot approaches, and the existence of an undiscovered software anomaly that resulted in a momentary loss of control and overshoot of the final approach course, followed by a steep descent and subsequent collision with a light pole."

The pilot elected to return to the airport and decided not to use thrust reversers during the landing roll to minimize yaw.  There was 'no significant pedal pressure' when he applied brakes following touchdown, and the airplane overran the runway.  The right main landing gear collapsed, and the right wing contacted the ground.  Examination revealed that the main gear downlock pins had been painted which resulted in the right pin sticking in the retracted (unlocked) position when the gear was raised after takeoff.  Additionally, the power brake valve pistons had been painted which resulted in the left piston sticking in the emergency (power off) position when the pilot tested the emergency brakes before takeoff.

Because there was rising terrain and scattered houses south of the airport, he had to maneuver to get to an open area. During the forced landing on the uneven terrain, one of the landing gear legs collapsed, and the aircraft impacted the terrain and slid into a power pole. A post-accident teardown inspection of the engine and the aircraft systems did not reveal any anomalies that would have resulted in the failure of the engine that lost power.",

The helicopter was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country ferry flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed. Of the three people aboard, the first pilot, seated in the left seat, the second pilot, seated in the right seat, and a passenger, were not injured. The flight was en route to Gulkana Airport, Alaska, the flight's first planned fuel stop. During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on June 13, the first pilot, a certificated flight instructor, reported that he had been hired to ferry the recently purchased helicopter to Georgetown, Texas. He added that he was providing AS350 B3 helicopter transition training to the second pilot, who was also the new owner of the helicopter. The first pilot reported that after having some difficulty starting the helicopter, he asked for assistance from a mechanic and another pilot. He said that while talking with another pilot on a cell phone about the correct starting procedure, the second pilot exited the helicopter, and a mechanic boarded the helicopter and sat down in the right seat. Once the helicopter was successfully started, the mechanic disembarked, and the second pilot again boarded the helicopter, and sat down in the right seat. The first pilot noted that while the helicopter was operating at flight-idle, the yellow \"TWT.GRIP\" light was illuminated on the annunciator panel, and he instructed the second pilot to slowly advance the collective-mounted throttle twist grip to the open position until the light went out. He said that as the second pilot began to advance the throttle to the open position, the engine immediately went to a very high RPM, and the helicopter began to shake violently, and it subsequently rotated about 240 degrees to the left. He said he did an emergency engine shutdown, and then all the occupants exited the helicopter.

It was their first flight together, and the instructor's first flight in the accident type airplane.  The instructor initiated a simulated loss of engine power by reducing the engine power to 1,000 rpm, and the student made an approach to an abandoned airstrip.  When the instructor told the student to recover and apply power, the engine would not respond.  The instructor took control of the airplane, but collided with trees short of the airstrip.  Postaccident inspection of the engine disclosed no obvious mechanical issues.  The engine was placed on another airframe, and was readily started and operated through various power settings.  At the time of the accident, visible moisture in the presence of cloud cover was present, and the temperature and dew point spread were conducive to the formation of carburetor ice.  The instructor and the student disagree on what instructions were given by the instructor during the simulated emergency and subsequent loss of engine power.  The instructor said he told the student what to do, including checking the carburetor heat.  The student, the airplane owner, refuted that the instructor told him to activate the carburetor heat, and said that he did not activate the carburetor heat.  The instructor wrote that he saw a knob pulled on the left side of the panel when he exited the airplane.  Photographs taken shortly after the accident depict the carburetor heat control on the left side of the panel extended about 1/2 of its full travel.  The photographs also revealed that the fuselage had been compressed several inches during the impact, and that the engine had been pushed in and down.

The engine continued to produce partial power until the airplane was in the airport traffic pattern, and then it lost total power. Due to a complete lack of forward visibility and another airplane in the runway run-up area, the flight instructor elected to make a forced landing on a roadway bordering the east side of the airport. The airplane struck a car and a pole before coming to a stop.A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the number 2 connecting rod had separated from the crankshaft. The connecting rod failed about mid-length, with the upper portion remaining attached to the piston. The lower portion of the connecting rod was not recovered. The upper portion of the connecting rod and a recovered section of the rod cap both failed as a result of overstress bending. Neither component appeared discolored, which suggests there was an adequate engine oil supply before the failure. The number 1 and 3 connecting rods remained attached to the crankshaft; the number 4 connecting rod had separated from the crankshaft. The number 1, 3, and 4 connecting rods were discolored, consistent with continued operation with an insufficient supply of engine oil. Deformation of the lower end of the number 4 connecting rod was consistent with secondary mechanical damage; however, the rod appeared otherwise undeformed.A lack of evidence of oil starvation and the preponderance of crankcase damage in the area of the number 2 cylinder suggests that the engine failure was initiated by the separation of the number 2 connecting rod from the crankshaft. Metallurgical examination of the number 2 cylinder assembly and related components did not identify the initiating cause of this connecting rod separation.

Witnesses observed the airplane at a low altitude, with the engines operating at high power. One witness, a pilot, reported that the speed was 'fast and not near a stall or Vmc.'  The airplane was observed to roll right and descended into a wooded area. The fuselage and wings were fragmented. Cut wood and impact marks corresponding to both engines were found at the accident site. A check of the airplane failed to reveal a mechanical failure or malfunction. A review of logbooks revealed no recent maintenance to the flight control system. A check with the pilot's doctors revealed no outstanding medical problems. ",

While doing so, the pilot noticed a sudden power loss, and the engine shut off.  The pilot attempted to restart the engine with no success and performed a forced landing to a farm field.  During the landing an outrigger rod broke.  The pilot also observed the engine ignition switch in the off position, 'indicating the possibility that I had inadvertently touched it while operating the mechanical lever for the [propeller] pitch change.'  The pilot replaced the outrigger rod and attempted a takeoff from the field.  After liftoff, the pilot noticed that the motorglider began to drift to the right, and struck a small tree located on the edge of the field.  The motorglider veered further to the right, touched down on the ground, struck two embankments lined with fence posts, and came to rest in an adjacent farm field.  Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane departed the field on a heading of about 080 degrees.  The winds reported by an airport 20 miles to the northwest were from 210 degrees at 10 knots. ",
