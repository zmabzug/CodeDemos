            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The glider broke up in flight during the recovery phase after a departure from controlled flight while maneuvering in thermal lift conditions.  Airborne witnesses in other gliders who saw the beginning of the sequence said the glider was in a tight turn, as if climbing in a thermal, when it entered a spiral or a spin.  With a 45-degree nose down attitude, the speed quickly built up as the glider completed two full rotations.  The rotation then stopped, the flight stabilized on a northeasterly heading, and the nose pitched further down to a near vertical attitude (this is consistent with the spin recovery technique specified in the Flight Manual).  The glider was observed to be pulling out of the dive, with the wings bending upward and the wing tips coning higher, when the outboard wing tip panels departed from the glider, the wings disintegrated, and the fuselage dove into the ground.    Several witnesses estimated the wing deflection reached 45-degrees or more before the wings failed.  Examination of the wreckage disclosed that the left and right outboard wing sections failed symmetrically at 2 locations. The glider is a high performance sailplane with an 87-foot wingspan and is constructed from fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composites.  The manufacturing process uses a hand lay-up of carbon and glass materials with applied epoxy resins.  The glider is certificated in the normal category in Germany under the provisions of the European Joint Airworthiness Regulations.Pilots with experience in the Nimbus 4 series gliders stated that the glider was particularly sensitive to over input of the rudder control during turns due to the 87-foot wingspan, with a resulting tendency for unwanted rolling moments.  The manufacturer reported that to avoid undesired rolling moments once the bank is established the ailerons must be deflected against the bank.Maneuvering speed (Va) is 180 km/h (97 kts) and the AFM notes that full control surface deflections may only be applied at this speed and below.  Never exceed speed (Vne) is 285 km/h (154 kts) and control deflections are limited to one third of the full range at this speed and a bold print cautionary note reads, \"Avoid especially sudden elevator control movements.\"  The manufacturer reported that design dive speed (Vd) is 324 km/h (175 kts). The manufacturer also said that, assuming a 45-degree nose down attitude with airbrakes closed, the glider would accelerate from stall speed to Vne in 8.6 seconds, with an additional 1.8 seconds to accelerate from Vne to Vd.  While no specific information on stick force per 'g' was available, certification flight test data showed that the elevator control stick forces were relatively light, with only 11.9 pounds of force (nose down) required to hold a fixed attitude at Vne versus the neutral stick force trim speed of 135 km/h (72.89 kts). Detailed examination of witness marks and other evidence in the wreckage established that the pilot extended the airbrakes at some point in an attempt to slow the glider during the descent prior to the break-up.  Concerning limitations on use of the airbrakes, the AFM notes that while airbrakes may be extended up to Vne they should only be used at such high speeds in emergency or if the maximum permitted speeds are being exceeded inadvertently.  The manufacturer noted that the airbrakes function like spoilers and have the effect of shifting the aerodynamic loads outboard on the wings.  The control linkages for the airbrakes and flaps are interconnected so that when full airbrake deployment is achieved, the flaps are extended to their full down limit. The maximum maneuvering load factor limits (in units of gravity or g's) change with variations in glider speed and flap/airbrake configuration.  From a \"flaps up\" configuration at Va to the condition of airbrakes and flaps extended at Vne, the maximum maneuvering load factor limits decrease from positive 5.3 to a positive 3.5.The pertinent certification regulations require a minimum safety margin of 1.5 above the design limit load, which is defined as ultimate load.  Review of the manufacturers data on safety margins in the wing spar disclosed that in the area of the primary wing failures, the structural design safety margin ranged between 1.55 and 1.75.The manufacturer supplied data of the wing deflections under various load and aerodynamic conditions.  At the design load limit (3.5g's) with airbrakes extended and at Vd, the wings were deflected to a 31-degree angle.  At the ultimate load limit, the deflection was 46.5-degrees, similar to the witness observations of the wing deflection just prior to the break up.An extensive series of scientific investigations were undertaken to establish:  1) if the structure as built conformed with the approved production drawings; 2) that the wing design met pertinent certification standards for strength safety margins; and 3) whether or not the failures occurred in overload beyond the ultimate load limits of the structure.  While production control type discrepancies were found in the structure that differed from drawing specifications, none contributed to the failures.  The testing established that the structure as built exceeded the minimum safety margin requirements.  All the wing failures were overload in character and occurred at loadings well above the ultimate design load limits.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's excessive use of the elevator control during recovery from an inadvertently entered spin and/or spiral dive during which the glider exceeded the maximum permissible speed, which resulted in the overload failure of the wings at loadings beyond the structure's ultimate design loads."

After the left seat pilot completed six hovering autorotations to the ground and eight autorotations to a power recovery, the right seat pilot snapped the right collective throttle to the ground idle position at 250 feet in a climb, to simulate a loss of engine power and announced 'power failure.'  The left seat pilot initiated an autorotation; neither pilot was aware of an actual loss of power.  When the left seat pilot applied throttle to initiate a power recovery, the engine's compressor stalled and the 'engine out' and 'auto re-ignite' lights illuminated.  The left seat pilot continued with the autorotation, landed on runway 22 with the tail-first, broke the skids, and the aircraft rolled over.  The investigation revealed that the right seat pilot did not perform the throttle rigging check before departing on the accident flight as recommended by the 369D pilot handbook. Several postaccident ground runs of the engine were conducted.  Based upon those, it was determined that rapid roll off of the right seat throttle could retard the throttle below ground idle and flameout the engine.  The throttle misrigging had not been detected by maintenance personnel. ",

The Safety Board's full report will be available soon at http://ntsb.gov/Publictn/publictn.htm. The Aviation Accident Report number is NTSB/AAR-07/03.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------On September 24, 2004, about 1642 Hawaiian standard time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N16849, registered to and operated by Bali Hai Helicopter Tours, Inc., of Hanapepe, Hawaii, impacted mountainous terrain in Kalaheo, Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, 8.4 miles northeast of Port Allen Airport, Hanapepe. The commercial pilot and the four passengers were killed, and the helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and postimpact fire. The nonstop sightseeing air tour flight was operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 and visual flight rules with no flight plan filed. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed near the accident site. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the pilot's decision to continue flight under visual flight rules into an area of turbulent, reduced visibility weather conditions, which resulted in the pilot's spatial disorientation and loss of control of the helicopter. Contributing to this accident was the pilot's inexperience in assessing local weather conditions, inadequate Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) surveillance of Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 71 operating restrictions, and the operator's pilot-scheduling practices that likely had an adverse impact on pilot decision-making and performance. The safety issues discussed in this report include the influence of pilot experience and operator scheduling on in-flight decision-making; the lack of FAA oversight of Part 91 air tour operators; the need for national air tour safety standards; and the lack of direct FAA surveillance of commercial air tour operators in Hawaii.  Nine safety recommendations are addressed to the FAA regarding local weather-training programs for newly hired Hawaii air tour pilots; evaluation of operational practices for commercial air tour helicopter pilots; Honolulu Flight Standards District Office control of the annual safety meetings, as required under approved certificates of waiver or authorization; evaluation of the safety impact of the altitude restrictions in the State of Hawaii; national air tour safety standards; and the potential benefits of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast technology for Hawaii air tour operators.

The commercial pilot received minor injuries; the helicopter accident site was overtaken and the helicopter destroyed by the surrounding forest fire.  The helicopter was registered to LRH Equipment LLC, and operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133, under contract to the Oregon State Department of Forestry for firefighting services. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on a company visual flight rules flight plan.The pilot stated to the NTSB investigator-in-charge that he was in a 165-foot hover over a shallow creek, filling the fire bucket, which usually takes 1-2 minutes. About 1 minute into the hover, the pilot sensed the helicopter start to settle.  He applied collective to arrest the settling but the helicopter continued to settle. He immediately lowered the collective, and performed a hovering autorotation toward the stream embankment. The helicopter's rotors struck a number of trees, it then turned 180 degrees, landed hard, and rolled over onto it's right side.  The pilot was able to shut the fuel off and secure battery power before egressing.  The pilot hiked out of the area before the forest fire overtook the  accident site and destroyed the helicopter.",

The pilot reported that he landed on the centerline and kept the nosewheel off the runway for 3 to 4 seconds. The nosewheel then touched down, and 3 to 4 seconds later, the airplane started veering to the left. The pilot first added some right rudder, and because the heading did not correct, he added more right rudder. When the heading still wouldn't correct, he \"jumped\" on the brakes and put the propeller into Beta and reverse. The airplane subsequently veered off the left side of the runway and into the median, where the nose landing gear separated from the airframe. Skid marks on the runway and in the grass were consistent with the pilot's recollection of the accident.The airplane had completed an annual inspection 20 days earlier, in which the nosewheel bearings were replaced. Postflight examination of the nosewheel revealed that it rotated freely and that the bearings appeared pristine with new bearing grease. The pilot also noted that he had not checked the tire pressures since the annual inspection, but had visually inspected the tires during preflight inspections.The airframe manufacturer determined that certain anomalies can reduce optimum steering capability in the make and model of the airplane, such as an underinflated nose landing gear tire, improper nose landing gear rake angle, excessive clearance between the nose landing gear steering arm and nose gear rollers, and low rudder cable tension. The airplane was examined 6 days after the accident, and the nosewheel tire pressure indicated 55 psi; a fully inflated tire should indicate 70 psi. Tire manufacturers estimate that up to a 5 percent reduction of tire pressure per day is normal, and even after continued losses after a period of time, an underinflated tire could still appear to be normally inflated. Given that the pilot had not checked the tire pressure in the 20 days before the accident, the nosewheel tire was likely underinflated (due to normal air loss) at the time of the accident; however, the tire pressure at the time of the accident could not be determined, and it could not be determined if it could have contributed to the loss of directional control. In addition, the three other detrimental effects on steering stability could not be measured because the nose landing gear separated from the airframe during the accident. Because of the benign landing conditions and the pilot's aeronautical experience, it is unlikely that the loss of directional control resulted from his piloting skills; it was more likely that it resulted from one or a combination of the four detrimental effects on steering stability..",

It is likely that the non-certificated pilot was operating the airplane slightly above the stall speed, but no audible warning horn was sounded due to the cobwebs; the pilot then likely let the airspeed drop further, and the airplane stalled and entered a spin; however, due to the close proximity to the ground the pilot was unable to recover.

As he was filling the left wing fuel tank before takeoff, the pilot was interrupted by another pilot who asked his assistance with operation of the self-fueling equipment.  He completed filling the left tank and stopped to assist the other pilot.  He returned to his airplane about 10 or 15 minutes later, filled the right-wing tank, and departed.

He spoke briefly with two people in the FBO office and then went out to the airplane to preflight it and have it fueled. Review of the departure airport air traffic control tower (ATCT) communications and air traffic control radar tracking data did not reveal any abnormalities with the departure or flight. About 7 minutes after departure, the pilot contacted the ATCT at his destination airport and advised the controller that he was planning to do three touch-and-go maneuvers. Per instructions from the controller, the pilot entered a right downwind for his assigned landing runway. When the airplane was near a location consistent with it being established on the base leg, several motorists observed it in a steep nose-down attitude and descending rapidly. The airplane impacted flat terrain about 1.5 miles from the airport. Neither of the two ATCT controllers observed the descent or impact. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded continued engine operation or flight.\u000b\u000bThe pilot had obtained his first Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate about 10 years before the accident, received annual recertification, and his most recent medical certificate was issued about 13 months before the accident. Review of the pilot\u2019s FAA medical records indicated that, for the intervening 9 years, the pilot was being treated for multiple cardiac issues and was subject to repetitive specialized medical testing. Further review indicated that the pilot had slow, essentially asymptomatic, progression of at least two components of his cardiac disease that are both independently associated with a significantly increased risk of sudden cardiac death as a result of a sudden arrhythmia. Although autopsy results indicated that the cause of death was blunt trauma, it is\u00a0likely that a complication of the pilot\u2019s cardiac disease caused him to become incapacitated, which resulted in his loss of control of the airplane and the subsequent crash.

This axial crack was considered the primary crack and the fracture origin area.  Microhardness tests near the fracture origin revealed a reduction in near surface hardness (lower hardness values than required).  GE concluded that the near surface low hardness was attributable to decarburization due to marginal (thin or detached) copper plating existing on the gearshaft surface during the hardening process.  Through computer modeling and testing of the radial gearshaft, GE concluded that the initiation of the axial crack was likely the result of a combination of high residual tensile stresses produced by local decarburization coupled with the operating stresses experienced at the outer diameter surface. To address the manufacturing process deficiency, GE issued seven service bulletins to remove, inspect, and repair the suspect radial gearshafts.  To expedite the removal of the suspect radial gearshafts, the Federal Aviation Administration issued three separate Airworthiness Directives (AD).  According to GE, all affected radial gearshafts addressed by the various FAA ADs have been removed from service. ",

The uncommanded swerves were described as the aircraft pulling to the left.  The crew was able to regain and maintain runway heading during each event. INJURIES:Passenger counts were not provided by ExpressJet.  No injuries were reported.DAMAGE TO AIRPLANE:NoneAIRCRAFT INFORMATION:The airplane was identified as an Embraer EMB-145LR, registration N12922, serial number 145338.FLIGHT RECORDERS:The flight data recorder was downloaded after an uncommanded swerve event on March 28, 2013, at about 0910 eastern daylight time, during the landing roll at Jacksonville International Airport (KJAX), Jacksonville, Florida.  The flight was identified as flight number 4618 and originated from Chicago O'Hare International Airport. The crew reported an uncommanded pull to the left but they were able to regain and maintain heading during the event. TEST AND RESEARCH:The aircraft experienced several uncommanded swerve events during multiple landings between the dates of 3/19/2013 and 3/29/2013.  The swerve events could not be duplicated by maintenance.  Troubleshooting during this timeframe resulted in the replacement of multiple nose wheel steering system components. On March 29th the nose wheel steering manifold assembly (P/N 308570-1007, S/N 0445B) was removed.  After the removal there were no further reports of uncommanded swerving or pulling to the left on the aircraft.  The manifold assembly was installed on the incident aircraft on March 8, 2013.  A review of the flights from the time the manifold assembly was installed to the time it was removed revealed that the swerving events were reported on the longer duration flights.  The manifold assembly was sent to Parker Aerospace (the component manufacturer) for component level testing that included cold soaking to simulate the conditions experienced during longer flights.The nose wheel steering hydraulic manifold assembly was examined at the Parker Aerospace facility in Irvine, California on June 3-4, 2013.  Testing of the manifold assembly revealed that there were unexpected pressures observed at the output chambers after the unit was cold soaked.  The electrohydraulic servo valve (EHSV) is a sub-component of the manifold assembly and was removed for further investigation.Testing of the EHSV occurred at the Woodward HRT (the component manufacturer) facility in Santa Clarita, California on June 5-6, 2013. The pressure anomalies observed during the manifold assembly tests were also identified during this testing of the EHSV. A teardown and examination of the EHSV identified the presence of a clear gel-like substance between the armature and the coil. Laboratory analysis revealed that the substance was similar to a thermally degraded MCS-352B lubricant. Pressure gain plots showed that hysteresis improved following the removal of the substance from the armature.  No other anomalies were identified during the examination or teardown of the EHSV.  The EHSV manufacturer indicated that there should not have been any substance in that area and that it was unknown how the substance could have gotten there.",

Witnesses reported that after lift-off, the airplane climbed about 200 to 300 feet above the runway and entered a steep right turn. The nose then dropped, and the airplane collided with the ground, adjacent to the runway. Presumably, due to injury, the pilot was unable to recall the occurrence. During a postaccident examination of the airplane, a foam-like material, used for the carburetor air intake filter, was found lodged in the carburetor throat; and one half of the retaining screen (to hold the foam) was absent. According to the aircraft records, the airplane had received an annual inspection three days before the accident flight, during which the filter was replaced. The airplane had been operated for an unspecified time following the inspection. Piper Service Bulletin 891 had been issued to provide for a one piece retainer for the filter, which would have precluded the filter from being drawn into the induction system. ",
            "probable_cause": "improper re-assembly of the engine induction air filter by maintenance personnel, during an annual inspection, which resulted in a loss of engine power during takeoff; failure of the pilot to abort the takeoff before lift-off; and failure of the pilot to obtain and/or maintain sufficient airspeed, which resulted in a stall.

The airplanes were operating at 2,500 feet mean sea level (msl), at 200 knots, with an overcast cloud layer about 300 feet above them. The pilots encountered deteriorating weather conditions about 40 miles prior to a planned fuel stop. The lead pilot turned to its left, and according to data extracted from the GPS receiver on board, the accident pilot initiated a climb, and then a course reversal to the right. During the turn to the right, the airplane climbed to nearly 3,800 feet, slowed to 144 knots, descended to 2,000 feet and accelerated to 255 knots, climbed back to 4,000 feet and slowed to 39 knots at the second-to-last data plot which was in the vicinity of the crash site. Two witnesses said they heard the airplane, and one witness observed it before ground contact. Examination of the crash site and the wreckage revealed damage to the trees and the airplane that were consistent with a near vertical descent and engine power at impact. The pilot of the lead airplane stated that he checked the weather prior to their departure, and that the weather conditions were clear all the way to their destination. However, AIRMETs for icing conditions from the surface to 10,000 feet, as well as for mountain obscuration due to clouds and precipitation were current along the planned route of flight in the area surrounding the accident site.

The flight did not divert to the closest airport located about 27 nautical miles to the southwest while at an altitude of about 15,900 feet.  This airport was a controlled field equipped with airport rescue and fire fighting (ARFF), and its longest runway was 9,005 feet.  The flight diverted to the departure airport located about 93 nautical miles to the north.  This airport was an uncontrolled field not equipped with ARFF, and its longest runway was 5,000 feet.  No emergency was declared.  The airplane was reported by a witness to be too high and too fast to land on runway 34 at the airport.  The winds were from 140 degrees at 6 knots.  The wreckage distribution was consistent with an impact resulting from a Vmc (minimum control speed with the critical engine inoperative) roll to the left.  The pilot received a checkout from the right seat in the accident airplane by the airplane owner.  The checkout was about 20 minutes in duration and did not include any single-engine flight maneuvers or emergency procedures.  The owner did not hold a certified flight instructor certificate.  The pilot had stopped flying for 12 years and just began giving flight instruction and flying in single-engine airplanes about a year prior to the accident.  The pilot's recent multiengine flight experience was limited to a couple of non-revenue flights within the past year while seated in the right seat of a King Air.  The King Air was used for commercial charter work which would involve one or two landings per flight.  One landing was made on the day prior to the accident.  The accident pilot asked the King Air pilot to accompany him along on the accident flight; the King Air pilot declined.  A multiengine commercial rated pilot-rated passenger, who the accident pilot knew, was seated in the right front seat.  Examination of the airplane's supplemental type certificate (STC) revealed that the airplane had undergone numerous inspections by different maintenance personnel.  The left engine's variable absolute pressure controller had safety wire around its control arm, which precluded its normal operation and a pressure relief valve that was not called for in the STC drawings.  At the time of issuance, Federal Regulation's did not require STC instructions for continued airworthiness.  Reliance on the airplane and engine maintenance manuals would not have provided enough information for continued airworthiness in accordance with the STC and could have yielded a setting exceeding those for which the STC parts were originally certificated to and thus increasing Vmc speed.Examination of the left engine revealed a cylinder head separation on the number six cylinder assembly, which had accumulated an estimated time since installation of 240 hours.  Visual inspection of the assembly revealed the presence of some undecipherable characters in its parts numbering.  A cylinder head separation from another airplane was also examined.  This cylinder assembly accumulated about 270 hours since installation.  Both cylinder assembly examinations revealed the presence of additional material on the cylinder barrel threads and fatigue fracture on the cylinder head.  ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed (Vmc) which resulted in a loss of control.   Contributing factors were the improper in-flight planning/decision not to land at a closer airport and the lack of recent experience in multiengine airplanes by the pilot-in-command, the cylinder head separation, the inadequate manufacturing process, and the lack of continued airworthiness instructions relating to the Riley Super-8 STC."

During a full aft center of gravity (CG) test flight, the airplane was placed in a left spin. The pilot attempted to recover from the spin but was unsuccessful. The pilot described the spin as \"uncontrollable.\" After three turns the pilot elected to deploy the BRS, as per the briefed procedures. After BRS deployment, the airplane continued to spin, twisting the BRS chute attachment straps. The pilot attempted to jettison the chute, but could not due to the twisting of the straps. The parachute-equipped pilot remained with the airplane until it reached the ground in the BRS chute. The airplane was substantially damaged  when it was drug by the chute in surface winds. The winds four minutes after the accident, 30 miles to the southwest, were reported as being at 14 knots, gusting to 23 knots.

The private pilot and one passenger received serious injuries. The airplane was substantially damaged by impact forces and a post-crash fire. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The airplane was owned and operated by a private individual under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. The flight was originating at the time of the accident.According to the pilot, on the morning of the accident he had fueled the airplane at Biddeford Municipal Airport (B19), Biddeford, Maine, and performed a \"full run-up and normal takeoff\" for the flight to 7B3. The takeoff, all systems, and flight characteristics appeared normal. After landing at 7B3, he taxied to the ramp and shut the airplane down. He did not refuel at 7B3, and a short time later he and his passenger embarked and taxied to runway 02, where he performed another engine run-up, with no anomalies noted. He indicated that the takeoff, and all systems including the airspeed, appeared normal. He said that the airplane lifted off at 65 MPH, but the aircraft would not climb. He asked the passenger to read the emergency checklist, and verified that the mixture was rich, the throttle was full, the fuel selector was on the fullest tank, the fuel pump was on, and the carburetor heat was off. He attempted to keep the airplane level; however, he raised the nose at the last minute as they approached a tree line. The airplane cleared the initial tree line; however, subsequently descended into the wooded area.According to a witness, as the airplane lifted off from the runway, it appeared to have a \"high angle of attack,\" and it looked as though it was \"mushing through the air\" after takeoff. During the initial climb the pitch attitude decreased briefly, and then increased before the airplane reached a tree line. After clearing the tress the nose lowered and the airplane disappeared out of sight. The witness further stated that he did not hear a loss of engine power at any time.Examination of the wreckage, at the scene, by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the airplane impacted a wooded area about 2,000 feet from the departure end of the runway and slightly right of the extended runway centerline.

The flight had been on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, but the pilot cancelled the IFR flight plan about 34 nm east of DDC and initiated a descent under visual flight rules.  Radar track data indicated that the airplane maintained a magnetic course of about 265 degrees during the flight from ICT to DDC.  The rate of descent was about 850 to 950 feet per minute.  During the descent, the airplane flew past the airport on a 270 degree course.  Witnesses in the area reported hearing the engine noise of a low-flying airplane followed by the sound of impact.  One of the witnesses described the engine noise as sounding like the engines were at \"full throttle.\"  The on-site inspection revealed that the airplane impacted the terrain in a gear-up, wings-level attitude.  The inspection of the airplane revealed no anomalies to the airframe or engines.  A review of the pilot's 72-hour history before the accident revealed that it had been 14 hours and 32 minutes from the time the pilot reported for duty about 1225 central standard time until the time of the accident.  It had been 20 hours 57 minutes from the time the pilot awoke (0600) on the morning before the accident until the time of the accident.  No evidence of pilot impairment due to carbon monoxide, drugs, or medical incapacitation was found.  The accident occurred during a time of day that was well past the pilot's normal bedtime and also at a time of day when the physiological need to sleep is especially strong.  The findings from a Safety Board's human performance analysis indicates that the pilot was likely fatigued.  A review of 14 CFR 135.267 indicated that the pilot had adhered to the flight time limitations and rest requirements specified in the regulation.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot failed to maintain clearance with terrain due to pilot fatigue (lack of sleep)."

On the next run-up, the rpm improved in the 2,200-to-2,300 rpm range, and the pilot felt this was fine for takeoff.  The takeoff roll seemed slower than normal, so he decided to climb over the airport in case of an emergency. On climbout at 100-to-200 feet agl, the engine again began running roughly. He began a shallow turn back toward the runway, and lost control of the aircraft.  The aircraft stalled, impacted the ground, and nosed over.  An inspection of the engine showed the rocker arm boss on the No. 1 cylinder had fractured due to fatigue cracking.  Lab analysis showed the boss was welded during cylinder overhaul, a procedure not allowed by Continental. ",
            "probable_cause": "1) the pilot's decision to takeoff in an aircraft with a known, yet unresolved, engine performance deficiency, and 2) the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed while maneuvering back to the runway.  A factor in the accident was the weld repair of the cylinder head rocker arm boss during overhaul, which led to a fatigue failure of the component. "

The airplane continued to descend, and the pilot tried to \"wiggle the throttle back and forth\" but the throttle would not advance beyond 1,000 RPM.  During the subsequent forced landing, just prior to touch down, the pilot pushed the throttle forward very hard and felt the throttle pop loose, and the pilot was able to move the throttle aft and forward; however, with no affect to the engine RPM.

He flared too high above the ground and added power to cushion the landing.  He failed to hold compensating elevator control and the nose pitched up.  He applied full power to abort the landing and the nose rose even further.  The airplane started 'a moderate left turn' and the pilot corrected to parallel the runway, maintaining 'a very steep angle of attack.'  He was able to land the airplane and taxied back to the maintenance hangar.  Postaccident inspection disclosed the right wing tip and lower portion of the rudder were damaged. ",
