During the return flight, the pilot encountered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). A review of Sky Connect data for the accident flight revealed that the helicopter was cruising at varying altitudes and never reached a steady state cruise altitude for any significant period of time. The majority of the flight was flown at altitudes below 1,000 feet with the greater part of the last 8-minute segment of the flight being operated below 800 feet. (The lowest altitude recorded during the last cruise segment of flight was 627 feet.) Witnesses who observed the helicopter before the accident described it as flying about 1,000 feet above ground level (agl), with its searchlight turning on and off, in moderate to heavy rain. A subsequent loss of control occurred, and the helicopter impacted terrain about 1.92 nautical miles (nm) southwest of Georgetown County Airport (GGE). Postaccident examination of the main wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the engine, drive train, main rotor, tail rotor, or structure of the helicopter. Additionally, there was no indication of an in-flight fire. During the first legs of his flight, the pilot experienced and observed VMC conditions along his route. However, postaccident witness reports and in-flight statements from the accident pilot indicated that the weather in the area had deteriorated since his southbound flight 2 hours prior. According to Omniflight\u2019s Savannah, Georgia, base manager, who was also a pilot operating in the area on the night of the accident, the weather that night was deteriorating but was forecast to remain well above minimums for his flight from Savannah to Greenville, South Carolina, and then to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. However, while he was refueling at the Greenville airport, the pilot of the accident helicopter contacted him by radio and advised him to double check the weather before returning to MUSC. The accident pilot stated that \u201cbad thunderstorms\u201d were in the GGE area and that he did not know if he would be able to return to his base that night. The Savannah base manager then advised the accident pilot that he could stay at the Charleston base that night. However, the accident pilot decided to return to his base at Conway-Horry County Airport (HYW), Conway, South Carolina.Review of radar data and weather observations provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration revealed that, after departing, the helicopter entered an area of convective activity and precipitation. The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research regional radar mosaic chart for 2333 also depicted a large area of echoes north of the frontal boundary, with several defined thunderstorms and rain showers extended over South Carolina and over the accident helicopter\u2019s flight route. Additionally, correlation of the radar data to the location of the accident site revealed that several defined cells surrounded the site at the time of the accident.The terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) for Myrtle Beach International Airport, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which was located 29 nm northeast of the accident site, was issued about 1928 and indicated expected marginal visual flight rules conditions through 0100 on September 26. From 2000 through 2130, variable winds to 15 knots with visibility of 4 miles in thunderstorms, moderate rain, and a broken ceiling of 3,500 feet agl in cumulonimbus clouds were expected. From 2130 to 0100, the wind was expected to be from 040 degrees at 12 knots with a visibility of 6 miles in light rain showers and mist and a broken ceiling at 2,000 feet agl. About 2207, the National Weather Service issued an amended TAF that expected instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions to prevail during the period with a broken ceiling at 700 feet agl and light drizzle and mist after midnight. The pilot had previously flown helicopters in IMC but was not current in instrument ratings at the time of the accident. The accident helicopter was not certificated for flight in IMC but had sufficient instrumentation to operate in the event of an inadvertent encounter with IMC. On the pilot\u2019s last Part 135 airman competency/proficiency check, which occurred on December 12, 2008, he satisfactorily demonstrated inadvertent IMC loss of control recovery. Although the pilot encountered an area of deteriorating weather and IMC, this did not have to occur as the pilot did not have to enter the weather and could have returned to Charleston Air Force Base/International Airport or landed at an alternate location. The pilot, however, chose to enter the area of weather, despite the availability of safer options. Based on the pilot\u2019s statement to the Savannah-based pilot regarding bad thunderstorms in the area, he was aware of the weather and still chose to fly into it. In addition, the pilot\u2019s inability to maintain a steady state cruise altitude during the flight and the declining altitude throughout the flight likely reflected his attempt to stay below the cloud level. These cues should have indicated to the pilot that it was not safe to continue flight into IMC. This decision-making error played an important causal role in this accident.In the absence of evidence indicating a mechanical malfunction, severe turbulence, or some other factor that would explain the accident pilot\u2019s apparent loss of control of the helicopter, spatial disorientation is a likely explanation, as it has contributed to many accidents involving loss of control. In many cases, loss of control follows a pilot\u2019s inappropriate control inputs resulting from confusion about the aircraft\u2019s attitude. Two major situational risk factors for spatial disorientation were present in this accident, including high workload and transitions between VMC and IMC that require shifting visual attention between external visual references and cockpit flight instruments. Attempts to continue visual flight into IMC are even more problematic for helicopter pilots than for pilots of fixed-wing aircraft because helicopters are inherently less stable and require near-continuous control inputs from the pilot. Helicopters, like the accident helicopter, that are not equipped for IFR flight and do not have control stabilization or an autopilot impose high perceptual and motor demands on the pilot. This can make it very challenging for pilots to maintain stable flight by referring to flight instruments alone. When the accident pilot attempted to continue visual flight into IMC, he would have been subjected to a high workload to maintain control of the helicopter. The extent of the weather and the duration of the flight also suggest that the pilot\u2019s encounter with IMC was prolonged. This would have further complicated the pilot\u2019s workload and increased the potential for spatial disorientation resulting from hazardous illusions, thereby increasing the potential for inappropriate control input responses.According to Omniflight\u2019s 135 Operations Manual, the pilot-in-command was responsible for obtaining weather information before beginning a series of flights. During interviews with National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators, Omniflight pilots indicated that, at the beginning of each shift, they would obtain weather information from a base computer and would advise the Omniflight Operational Control Center (OCC) of weather conditions in the operating area throughout the period of their flight. Before any launch, the OCC must approve the flight. If the OCC knew of adverse weather, it would contact the pilot to evaluate the weather. Based on launch approval and actual weather conditions encountered and reported by the pilot, the weather at takeoff and along the flight route was VMC. About 2242, an MUSC communications center specialist spoke with an Omniflight OCC operations coordinator and indicated that the helicopter would be returning to HYW as soon as the patient transfer was complete. The operations coordinator then advised the MUSC specialist that if the pilot called before takeoff, they would review the weather with him for his return flight. However, the pilot never called the OCC, and the OCC did not contact the pilot. While the OCC was not required to contact the pilot and review the weather, if the OCC had contacted the pilot before takeoff, the OCC could have advised the pilot about the adverse weather, given him the updated TAF information issued about 2207 with IMC, and noted the potential risks involved with the flight. On February 7, 2006, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-06-14, which asked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to \u201crequire emergency medical services operators to use formalized dispatch and flight-following procedures that include up-to-date weather information and assistance in flight risk assessment decisions.\u201d On February 18, 2010, based on the FAA\u2019s pending notice of proposed rulemaking concerning helicopter operations and pending timely issuance of a final rule mandating formalized dispatch and flight-following procedures that include up-to-date weather information and assistance in flight risk assessment decisions, the NTSB classified this recommendation \u201cOpen\u2014Acceptable Response.\u201dThe accident helicopter was not equipped with an autopilot. On September 24, 2009, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-09-96, which asked the FAA to \u201crequire helicopters that are used in emergency medical services transportation to be equipped with autopilots and that the pilots be trained to use the autopilot if a second pilot is not available.\u201d On December 23, 2009, the FAA stated that it would conduct a study of the feasibility and safety consequences of requiring a second pilot or operable autopilot. On October 7, 2010, pending the NTSB\u2019s review of the results of this study, Safety Recommendation A-09-96 was classified \u201cOpen\u2014Acceptable Response.\u201d",

The pilots recovered control of the airplane and diverted to West Palm Beach, Florida, where they landed without further incident.  The 2 flight crewmembers, 1 flight attendant, and 25 passengers were uninjured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the elevators and the horizontal stabilizer. Flight 5054 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled international passenger flight from Nassau International Airport, Bahamas, to Orlando International Airport, Florida.  The flight departed in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). In postaccident interviews, the captain stated that while in VMC, the airplane flew normally. Flight data recorder (FDR) data indicate that about 7 minutes before the upset occurred, the airplane was at about 17,000 feet msl, with the autopilot engaged and airspeed stabilized near 200 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). These data indicate that beginning about 1818, the airspeed slowed to 185 KIAS over a 1?minute period as the autopilot began trimming airplane nose-up (ANU) to maintain altitude.  The airspeed then decreased to about 137 KIAS over the next 3 minutes. The airplane continued to maintain a constant altitude as the autopilot trimmed the airplane from about 0 to about 7 degrees ANU. The first officer stated that immediately before the upset occurred, he switched the leading-edge deicing system inflation cycles switch from \"light\" to \"heavy\" and the propeller deicing system cycles switch from \"norm\" to \"cold\" because he saw \"more ice accumulation than he had ever seen\" on the wing and spinner. FDR data indicate that when torque indications for both engines were about 55 percent and the airspeed was about 141 KIAS, the autopilot was disengaged.  The airplane then pitched down and rolled about 80 degrees to the left, then rolled back to near level.  During the next 20 seconds, engine torque increased to about 98 percent on both engines, the airplane rolled about 110 degrees to the left, returned to level flight, rolled about 130 degrees to the right, returned to level flight, then rolled 360 degrees to the right before returning to near wings level, with torque on both engines stabilized at about 22 percent.  The airplane's behavior during the upset is consistent with an ice-induced stall event. The first officer stated in postaccident interviews that the stick shaker and aural stall warning, which is part of the airplane's stall warning/protection system, activated but did not indicate whether it was before, during, or after the upset. The Safety Board's investigation could not precisely determine whether or when the stick shaker and aural stall warning activated.Meteorological data at the time of the accident indicate that Comair flight 5054 may have encountered an area of icing conducive to the formation of super-cooled large droplets (SLD). The EMB-120 is not certified for flight in SLD conditions. FDR data indicate that airspeed had decreased to only about 137 KIAS before control of the airplane became difficult and altitude was no longer maintained.  However, according to the Embraer EMB-120 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance section, the airplane stalling speed is about 115 knots calibrated airspeed for an airplane at the accident airplane's approximate gross weight at the time of the event (23,800 pounds). ",
            "probable_cause": "the failure of the flight crew to maintain airspeed during an encounter with severe icing conditions, which resulted in an inadvertent stall, loss of control, and structural damage to the airplane."

About 30 minutes into the flight, the engine started to sputter, and then it stopped; the pilot was unable to restart the engine, and the airplane began to lose altitude. The passenger recalled that he observed the stall warning light illuminate and that the airplane was in a turn, but he did not recall the impact.

He started to lower the collective, but could not control the helicopter, which tipped over on its left side as it impacted the ground.

With an altitude of about 50 feet and a forward airspeed around 35 to 40 mph he entered a circling maneuver. While flying upwind he reduced engine RPM, and as he turned downwind, he pulled up on the collective, but felt the helicopter sinking instead of climbing. He then looked at the engine instruments and saw the rotor RPM going below 85%. Immediately, he pushed the collective down, but was unable to regain RPM. He deployed emergency floats about 10 feet above the water. The helicopter hit the water \"hard\" in about 4 feet of water and then rolled onto its right side, due to the right flotation bag being torn off upon impacting the water.

The pneumatic line that backed off the fitting is located on the backside of the governor and is hard to see and check for proper torque during routine maintenance.",

The loss of tail rotor control was due to the lower support yoke arm bushing being loose in the lower support yoke arm.  During operation of the tail rotor controls, the looseness transferred the cyclic operational stresses, via the expansion pin assembly, to the upper support yoke arm, which failed in fatigue.  Under continued operation, the pitch control input rod then translated upwards into the path of the rotating tail rotor gearbox input flange.  The pitch control rod wore down until the input rod no longer transmitted operational forces and it separated with the sequential loss of tail rotor control.

The pilot told the briefer that the airplane was equipped with onboard radar for weather avoidance.  After takeoff, the pilot received two adverse weather advisories from the departure air traffic controller.  The pilot acknowledged, requested and was cleared for course deviations to avoid the weather.  The pilot was subsequently told to contact an en route traffic control center.  The pilot did not request an update on, nor was he advised of, any additional adverse weather after switching over.  Avionics data recovered from the wreckage showed the airplane encountered decreasing outside air temperatures (OAT) during the en route climb to a cruise altitude.  The OAT decreased below freezing as the airplane climbed through 15,900 feet mean sea level.  The primary flight display's (PFD) airspeed data decreased from about 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) to 0 KIAS.  During the loss of airspeed, the airplane's recorded climb rate decreased and the airplane entered a left turn.  At this point, the en route controller asked the pilot if he had been given a clearance to deviate around weather.  The pilot responded, \"mike delta we've got problems uh... .\"  There were no additional communications received from the pilot and radar contact with the airplane was lost shortly thereafter.

Various wing components were examined and compared with the building instructions and plan drawings.  The examination revealed fracture features indicating that the wings failed in a positive overload event.  No evidence of preexisting cracks or deteriorated wood was  found.  However, the comparison with the design revealed that the construction of the spars did not comply with their design drawings.  In particular, the spars did not contain stiffener blocks adjacent to the upper and lower caps, and the filler blocks ended abruptly in a vertical line instead of tapering to the upper and lower caps.  The filler blocks were thinner than specified in the plans and occupied 50 percent of the space between the spar caps instead of all the void.

On the last flight, after the skydivers exited the airplane, the pilot initiated a descent and the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot knew he could not make it back to the airport and made a forced landing to a gravel area. The airplane collided with a gravel mound and nosed over resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. According to the pilot, the airplane owner assisted him in fueling the airplane from a local fuel truck. The pilot said he used a ladder and started refueling the right wing with the owner manning the pump. While they were refueling the airplane, the owner asked the pilot if he was getting any fuel because the fuel meter was not running. They looked at the airplane's right main fuel tank and it appeared to be full. The pilot then added what he believed to be 10 gallons of fuel to the left main fuel tank. The pilot thought he had 37.5 gallons of fuel on board when he departed. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions, nor did the pilot report any. The examination also did not reveal any evidence of usable fuel. Additionally, examination of the airplane rubberized bladder type fuel cells located on the inboard bay of each wing panel revealed the snap fasteners normally used to prevent the collapse of the flexible cells were not installed and wrinkling of the bladder was noted. The fuel bladders were replaced about 5 years prior to the accident. It is possible that due to the wrinkling of the right fuel bladder, the pilot may not have had the fuel that he expected when the tank was topped off.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the improper installation of snap fasteners to the rubberized type fuel cells which resulted in wrinkling of the fuel bladders and incorrect fuel quantity for the flight."

Normally, the pilot would fill up his auxiliary fuel tank or the tip tanks, but not both at the same time.  The pilot said his habit was to rotate between using the auxiliary tank and the tip tanks about every 3 to 4 months.   Because he had been using the auxiliary fuel tank for the last several months, he decided to use the wing tip tanks for this flight.  The pilot did not run the engine from the tip tanks prior to departing the airport.  About 40 minutes into the flight he switched from the main fuel tank to the right tip tank.  Prior to selecting the tip tank, he turned on the auxiliary fuel pump.  As had happened in the past when he had not used the wing tip tanks for an extended period, he expected the engine to sputter and then restart.  However, on this occasion, after the engine sputtered, it did not restart.  The pilot then switched the fuel selector back to the main tank and verified that he was getting fuel pressure, but the engine would not restart.

The student pilot sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the instructional flight conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the airplane was parked on the ramp as the student pilot prepared to conduct a local solo flight. The student pilot reported that the airplane was not equipped with a parking brake. He primed the engine four times and opened the throttle 1/4 to 1/2 inch for starting. Upon starting the engine, the airplane began to roll; however, the brakes were not effective and the throttle control would not move. The airplane continued to roll and the student pilot was able to turn enough to avoid hitting a hangar. The airplane rolled approximately 344 feet from where it was parked, struck trees and sustained substantial damage to the forward portion of the fuselage, left wing, and engine firewall.Postaccident examination of the airplane by FAA inspectors, which included a functional check of the brakes, did not reveal any preaccident malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Both the throttle and mixture controls were impact damaged; however, they remained properly connected. It was also noted that the airplane was equipped with a parking brake.According to maintenance records, the airplane had been operated about 6 hours since its most recent annual inspection, which was performed about 30 days prior to the accident.

The pilot reported that he initiated a left 180-degree turn to a clear area.  The autorotation was terminated over tall grass and during touchdown the helicopter rolled over and came to rest on its right side.

The pilot reported that he did not perceive any anomalies or engine warnings prior to the loss of engine power.  A preliminary examination of the helicopter was conducted under the supervision and control of the NTSB Investigator-in-Charge.  Initial examination of the engine revealed that the compressor (N1) would not rotate.  The engine was subsequently removed from the airframe and shipped to the engine manufacturer's facilities for further evaluation and teardown examination.

Damage to the 6th stage of the compressor and compressor case assembly were considered to be secondary.  A detailed metallurgical examination of the compressor revealed that the compressor failure was result of the separation of one or more of the 5th stage compressor blades.  Some of the blade fragments were recovered during the engine examination; however they were heavily damaged precluding further analysis.

He hand prop started the engine, allowed the engine to warm up, and then performed an engine run-up check of the magnetos and the carburetor heat function, with no abnormalities noted. He stated that he did not recall the oil pressure of the engine during the engine run-up. As soon as the main landing gear came off the runway, the pilot noted the engine rpm was less than 2,400 rpm, instead of its usual 2,600 rpm. He ensured that the throttle was full forward and leveled the airplane at 100 feet above the ground, but the engine rpm did not increase. The pilot elected to turn the airplane for a precautionary landing on the intersecting runway. As he maneuvered the airplane in the turn, he noticed the engine rpm slowly decreasing until the engine experienced a total loss of engine power and the propeller stopped turning.

The pilot received minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, which departed Groton-New London Airport (GON), Groton, Connecticut, destined for Orange County Airport (MGJ), Montgomery, New York. According to the pilot, earlier in the day she had flown the airplane from MGJ to GON. She had approximately 20 gallons of fuel in each wing tank prior to departure. She did not refuel at GON. At approximately 1555 she departed on her return flight to MGJ. After takeoff she made a left turn and established herself on course. She then climbed to 4,500 feet above mean sea level and trimmed for cruise flight, set 2,300 revolutions per minute (rpm), manifold pressure to 23 inches of mercury, and fuel flow to 13 gallons per hour. Sometime later, air traffic control (ATC) pointed out traffic to the pilot however, the sun was directly ahead of her, and very bright, making it difficult for her to see. She then advised ATC that she was looking for traffic, and shortly afterwards, she heard \"a loud explosive bang - like a gunshot.\" She immediately checked her instruments. The rpm had risen to \"over 2,500 rpm \u2013 over redline.\" She then reduced the propeller control back with no effect. The plane started to \"shudder \u2013 physically shaking me.\" The rpm on her tachometer had now dropped to 2,000. Her airspeed had also dropped off and she began to lose altitude. She then checked her propeller setting and aggressively advanced the propeller, but there was no increase in rpm.She contacted ATC and told them she had engine problems and declared an emergency. ATC advised her to land at Chester Airport (SNC), Chester, Connecticut, which was the nearest airport. She then requested vectors to SNC. They advised her to turn to a heading of 180 degrees which she did. She advised ATC that she did not see the airport, nor did she see any other clearing or road. All she saw were trees, and she continued to lose altitude. She flew the plane straight and level, as best she could, trying to maintain the plane's best glide speed. She called ATC again requesting the location of the airport. They advised her that it was about 2 miles at her 12 o'clock position. However, she still could not see it. She realized at this point that she was not going to find the airport or any other open area before she hit the trees. She continued to fly the plane straight and level and decided not to put the landing gear down as she was aiming to land the airplane on top of the trees, hoping they would cushion the plane as it descended to the ground. She reached down to shut the fuel selector off because she was afraid there might be a fire once she crashed. She knew there was still plenty of fuel on board. However, since she did it as she was approaching the tree tops, she could not look at the fuel selector handle to check its setting. She knew she turned the handle, but she was not sure if she had fully turned it to the left to the \"Off\" position from the right tank before the plane then collided with the trees. Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that the airplane came to rest inverted, in a nose and left wing down position, wedged between trees, 10 feet above ground level. Both fuel bladders were breached; however, fuel was discovered to be trapped in the undamaged portion of each fuel bladder. Approximately 17 gallons of fuel was recovered from the right wing tank. Less than 1 gallon of fuel was recovered from the left wing tank. The fuel selector was in the \"LEFT TANK\" position. The fuel strainer was clean, free of debris, and devoid of fuel. No fuel was recovered from the fuel supply line to the engine driven fuel pump.The propeller remained attached to the engine; the blades remained secured in the hub. One propeller blade was unremarkable, the tip of one propeller blade was bent aft, and the third blade displayed a slight twist. None displayed leading edge impact damage.The wreckage was retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

The CFI took the controls and attempted several times to move the throttle control but was unable. The certified flight instructor (CFI) maneuvered the airplane toward a nearby airport, but was unable to maintain altitude due to the decreased engine rpm.

The airplane impacted 50-foot tall trees prior to striking the ground.  The pilot reported that he had topped-off the airplane's fuel tanks, which had a total capacity of 44 gallons of usable fuel prior to the flight.  He leaned the fuel mixture during the flight, and expected the airplane to have an endurance of 4.6 hours.  Examination of the wreckage and accident site did not reveal any evidence that either fuel tank contained an appreciable amount of fuel at impact.  The pilot reported 94 hours of total flight experience; which included about 13 hours in the same make and model as the accident airplane.",

Weather forecasts noted cloud bases and tops of 6,000 (less than 1,000 agl) and 25,000 feet, respectively. AIRMETS predicted mountain obscuration, moderate mixed icing conditions, and moderate to severe turbulence from the 7,000-foot freezing level to 26,000 feet. Winds aloft were out of the west at 65 to 70 knots over the mountains. About 1 hour into the flight the pilot air-filed an IFR flight plan and requested 13,000 feet.  He was subsequently given 16,000 feet. 10 minutes later the pilot made the first of many subsequent requests for a clearance to a lower altitude. The controller responded that 16,000 feet was the lowest MVA for the next 60 miles or more. 2 hours and 22 minutes from departure the pilot declared an emergency due to an engine failure. The controllers provided vectors to the closest airport, which was behind the aircraft at 9 miles. The aircraft collided with a mountain at the 10,900-foot level. The pilot had only recently moved to the west coast and had limited experience flying over the Sierra Nevada Mountains. No oxygen tubes were found plugged into the cabin side wall regulator panel, and the main supply tank in the aircraft empennage was in the off position. The fuel selector was found selected to the left main tank.  Hydraulic fuel cell bladder rupture and deformation to the surrounding containment structures was noted to the right main and fuselage auxiliary tanks. No such evidence was found to the left main tank bladder or surrounding structures. No evidence of preimpact malfunction or failure was found during examination of the engine. Review of the flight timing elements reveals that the pilot operated at msl altitudes above 12,000 feet in excess of 1 hour 50 minutes, with about 1 hour of that time spent between 15,000 and 16,000 feet. Section 8-1-2 of the AIM states in part that due to hypoxia pilot performance and judgment can seriously deteriorate within 15 minutes at 15,000 feet. ",

On the first launch attempt, the glider overflew the tow cable and it automatically disconnected when the glider was low to the ground. The glider was able to make a safe landing on the runway. The pilot was overheard saying that the first launch failed because he should have initiated the climb sooner. On the second attempt, the glider once again overran the tow cable. Before the tow cable released, the pilot lowered the nose to pick up the slack in the cable and he instructed the winch operator to go faster. These two steps appeared to have corrected the problem, and the pilot initiated a climb. Shortly after, the glider began to overfly the cable again and it disconnected. The glider entered free flight just above stall speed about 75 feet above the runway. A witness saw the glider nose over and thought the pilot was going to land. Instead, the glider descended rapidly and drifted to the left toward a taxiway. The witness saw the wings of the glider rock back and forth before it impacted the ground hard.

The pilot informed an air traffic controller that he was diverting around an area of thunderstorms. The pilot last reported that he was in \u201cbad\u201d weather and was going to try to get out of it. Following that transmission, radio and radar contact was lost. A witness on the ground heard a sound resembling an explosion. She reported that at the time she heard the noise the rain was falling as a light drizzle. However, by the time she and her husband got outside to see what the explosion was, the rain started \u201cpouring down.\u201d The witness\u2019s husband found the airplane\u2019s main wreckage about 450 feet southwest of their house. The main wreckage consisted of the entire airplane except for the left wing, vertical stabilizer, rudder, and the right wing tip fuel tank. Those components were located about 200 feet north-northeast of the main wreckage. An examination of the left wing spar showed that the wing failed in positive overload. Flight control continuity was confirmed at the accident site. A postcrash examination of the airplane\u2019s engine and other systems did not reveal any preimpact anomalies. A weather study of conditions in the area at the time of the accident indicated the potential for heavy rain showers, thunderstorms, wind in excess of 45 knots, clear air turbulence, and low-level wind shear. While the pilot\u2019s toxicology testing results were positive for tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (marijuana) in the liver and kidney, the levels were determined not to be impairing. The pilot had a global positioning system (GPS) unit with a current subscription for Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD). At the time of the accident the depiction in the cockpit would have reflected weather conditions that occurred a couple of minutes earlier. The GPS unit\u2019s owner\u2019s manual states that NEXRAD weather data should be used for \u201clong-range planning purposes only,\u201d and not to \u201cpenetrate hazardous weather,\u201d as the \u201cNEXRAD data is not real-time.\u201dOn June 19, 2012, the NTSB issued a Safety Alert to warn pilots using in-cockpit flight information services broadcasts (FIS-B) and satellite weather display systems that the NEXRAD \"age indicator\" can be misleading. The actual NEXRAD data can be as much as 20 minutes older than the age indication on the display in the cockpit. If misinterpreted, this difference in time can present potentially serious safety hazards to aircraft operating in the vicinity of fast-moving and quickly developing weather systems. In addition to raising pilot awareness on this issue, the Safety Alert also reminds pilots of the importance of obtaining a thorough preflight weather briefing.",

One medical crewmember opened the aft cargo door, removed medical equipment, and then closed the door.  He then checked the auxiliary power unit (APU) door and boarded the helicopter.  During this time the second medical crewmember had boarded the helicopter.  The pilot reported that the takeoff was normal.  Ten minutes after takeoff, the helicopter was in cruise flight at 700 feet agl (8 miles from the destination) when a loud bang was heard.  The helicopter yawed right and the nose dipped.  The pilot lowered the collective and moved the throttle to flight idle.  Subsequently, the helicopter landed hard on soft terrain, amongst pecan trees, and came to rest upright.  Examination of the accident site and helicopter revealed that a medical blanket had exited from the aft cargo compartment and contacted the tailrotor blades severing the tailrotor drive shaft.  Examination of the aft cargo door revealed that its locking mechanism was not damaged, and operated normally.",

The certified flight instructor (CFI) and PUI obtained a full weather briefing and the CFI had been to the airport on many occasions.  They listened to the weather observation taken from a nearby mountain pass and the winds were reported from 090 degrees at 8 knots.  They over flew the airport and noted that the windsock was indicating calm winds and they elected to land to the south.  During the approach into the mountain airport, the CFI noted a light bump over the approach end of the 2,875-foot long, 30-foot wide runway.  After calculating takeoff distances and determining density altitude, the CFI and PUI noted that the windsock was still indicating calm wind conditions, so they elected to depart to the north (the calm wind preferred departure route).  The CFI noted that the temperature was 18 degrees Celsius.  They configured the airplane for a short field takeoff, applying 15 degrees of flaps.  While holding the brakes, the PUI added full power and began the takeoff roll.  The CFI noted that maximum static power was being obtained.  The PUI rotated the airplane at 50 knots (target speed was 56 knots).  Approximately 15-20 feet above ground level, a gust of wind blew the airplane to the right and the CFI assumed control of the airplane.  The airplane then sank.  At this point, the CFI elected to discontinue the takeoff and as the airplane settled downward, he noted a newly installed guardrail at the end of the runway.  He applied additional power to overfly the guardrail and land in a clear area beyond it.  The airplane began to slow and then impacted a ditch and nosed-over.",
