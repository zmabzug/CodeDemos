Simultaneously, the captain and first officer applied forward pressure on their control columns to regain control of the airplane.  The airplane was re-established in a descent and the flight crew found that the airplane was controllable in the landing configuration.  Subsequently, the flight landed without further incident.  Post incident examination of the airplane revealed that the right elevator trim control wheel was improperly installed.  The installation allowed the autopilot trim servo to request nose down trim until the trim tab actuators had reached their physical limits.  The autopilot trim servo continued to request nose down trim, loading the elevator trim system cables, until the autopilot disconnected.  During the examination, it was also noted that the trim tab deflections and cable tensions did not meet manufacturer specifications.

The purpose of the flight was to check the weather conditions for passenger tour flights that day.  The pilot reported about 20 minutes prior to the accident that the ceiling was 6,500 feet mean sea level (msl).  Radar data showed that following this weather report, the airplane's radar track continued eastbound and upon its return westbound, at an altitude of about 6,000 feet msl, the airplane entered a series of altitude fluctuations approximately 1 mile west of a ridge that was the location of the accident, descending at 4,000 feet per minute while turning northbound, and then climbing at 3,900 feet per minute while traveling eastbound, prior to disappearing from the radar.  The airplane impacted on the eastern side of the ridge.  There were no monitored distress calls from the aircraft and no known witnesses to the accident.  Prior to the accident, there were reports of vibrations during flight on this aircraft, although many went unreported to maintenance personnel.  The day (and flight) prior to the accident, a pilot experienced a vibration during flight with passengers and it was not reported to maintenance personnel because it was logged improperly in the operator's maintenance tracking system.  No corrective actions were taken.  During the post accident examinations, no portions of the right elevator and trim tab were identified in the wreckage, or at the accident site.  The bracket attachment to the right elevator was found loose within the wreckage and was torsionally twisted counterclockwise (aft).  Ground and aerial searches for the missing parts based on a trajectory study were unsuccessful.  This aircraft was equipped with a foam cored elevator trim tab that was installed during aircraft manufacture.  A service difficulty report (SDR) query showed that 47 reports had been issued on elevator trim tab corrosion and many included reports of vibrations during flight.  On January 20, 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) CE-05-27, which addressed potential problems with foam-filled elevator trim tabs in the accident make/model airplane, and Cessna 206 and 210 series airplanes.  The SAIB indicated that the foam-filled elevator trim tabs, manufactured until 1985, were reported to have corrosion between the tab and the foam.  The SAIB further said, in part, \"When the skin of the trim tab becomes thin enough due to the corrosion, the actuator can pull the fasteners through the skin and disconnect.  When this occurs, the tab can flutter.\"  Some reports indicated prior instances of \"vibrations in the tail section and portions of the elevator tearing away with the trim tab.\"  Prior to the issuance of the SAIB, Cessna Aircraft Company issued a Service Bulletin (SB) SEB85-7 on April 5, 1985, that addressed elevator and trim tab inspection due to corrosion from moisture trapped in the foam cored trim tabs.   Based on a review of the airplane's logbooks, the SB was not complied with, nor was the operator required to do so based on the FAA approved maintenance specifications.",

He took the controls and attempted to restore engine power but was unsuccessful.  He maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing in a field, and when the flight was approximately 20 feet above ground level he recognized there were drainage ditches in the field.  The airplane was landed in the field, and during the landing roll the nose landing gear collapsed after traveling into a ditch.  The airplane then slid into a second ditch, and came to rest approximately 158 feet from the first ditch impact location.  Examination of the engine revealed the crankshaft was fractured at the No. 3 cylinder connecting rod journal; there was no evidence of lack of lubrication or fretting on the faying surfaces of the crankcase halves.  Metallurgical examination of the crankshaft revealed the fracture surface was located in the aft radius of the No. 3 connecting rod journal; fatigue progression was noted to initiate from the intersection of the radius and the journal.  The fracture propagated in a plane perpendicular to the journal surface from a single origin.  The fatigue initiation site did not contain scoring marks or scratches.  All connecting rod journals measured 2.114 inches.  The No. 3 connecting rod journal superficial macro hardness was slightly below the minimum specified limit, while the core hardness was within limits.  The overall aft radius was determined to be 0.152 inch, while a localized transition radius of .015 inch at the fatigue origin location was noted.  The crankshaft had been to two FAA certified repair stations (FAA CRS), the first time on December 14, 1991, and the second time on August 2, 2001.  Both repair stations rejected the crankshaft due to a crack in the No. 1 main bearing area.  The records from the facility that inspected the crankshaft in 2001 indicate the No. 3 connecting rod journal measured 2.1193 inches at the time it was rejected; no work was performed to it.  The owner reported that following the rejection in 2001, he took the crankshaft to another FAA CRS who reportedly ground two connecting rod journals and polished the crankshaft.  The owner did not have a receipt or yellow tag for the work performed to the crankshaft.  The engine was assembled, and had been operated 87.8 hours since being reassembled at the time of the crankshaft failure.  The president of the FAA CRS that the owner of the airplane reported last worked on the crankshaft reported he did not have any records pertaining to the accident crankshaft.

He reported the airplane exited the left side of the runway and the nose gear \"dug in\" and the airplane nosed over about 2,000 feet from the touchdown point.  An inspection of the airplane revealed that the left and right brakes operated.  The nose gear fork was found broken with numerous fracture surfaces.  All the fracture surfaces were consistent with overstress fractures.  The nose wheel tire exhibited scuffing on the right half of the tire around its entire circumference.  Grass was found embedded in between the tire and wheel rim on the right side of the tire.  The left side of the tire had no scuff marks.  The inspection of the nose wheel steering linkage indicated the nose wheel linkage was positioned in the full left direction.  The inspection of the accident site revealed three tires skid marks approximately 1,600 feet in length extended from the airplane wreckage back to the touchdown zone on the runway.  The tire marks veered to the left after touchdown.  The airplane was equipped with an electric/hydraulic nose wheel steering system.  The pilot reported that the nose wheel steering system was off during the landing.  The airplane was equipped with the airplane's originally designed nose landing gear.  The airplane was also equipped with the airplane's originally designed nose gear steering system's hydraulic actuator/shimmy dampner and steering linkage.",

The air traffic controller provided the pilot with instructions to the nearest airport, which was about 21 miles away. The pilot radioed that he thought that he could make it and began a descent toward the airport.  A witness near the accident site observed the airplane flying in a southwesterly direction about 500 feet above ground level. As the airplane approached a set of suspended power lines, it pitched up 15 degrees, increased altitude by 100 to 200 feet, yawed to the right, made two 360-degree rotations descending vertically, and impacted terrain, consistent with an aerodynamic stall/spin.Postaccident examination of the engine revealed a 2-inch hole in the top of the crankcase between the Nos. 3 and 4 cylinders. The No. 1 piston connecting rod had separated from the crankshaft, bending the end cap flat with no thermal discoloration evident. Laboratory examination of the bearing insert half identified circumferential wear marks on the back side of the bearing insert. The wear marks on the backside of the intact insert, the lack of heat damage to the connecting rod journal, and the lack of heat damage to the connecting rod and end cap suggest that the bearing began to spin, which led to extrusion/ejection of half of the connecting rod bearing. Once the bearing was free, fragments of bearing material worked their way up between the piston and the cylinder wall causing damage to and embedding in the piston skirt. The increased clearances between the connecting rod end cap and connecting rod journal caused large stress amplitudes that resulted in a fatigue fracture of the connecting rod bolts.In 1998, after 1,002 hours of operation, the engine was top overhauled. A top overhaul does not inspect or replace items inside the crankcase, such as the main bearings or connecting rod bearings. At the time of the accident, the engine had accumulated 2,601 hours.  The engine manufacturer recommends that the time between overhaul be 1,500 hours or every 12 years.",

After completing 1.7 hours of instruction, the instructor and pilot landed uneventfully and fueled the helicopter. Shortly after departure for a nearby airport, about 600 feet above ground level, the helicopter experienced a total loss of engine power. The instructor took control of the helicopter and performed an autorotation to a field; however, the helicopter rolled during touchdown and sustained substantial damage. The experimental engine used the engine case and crankshaft of the kit engine, but an additional 40 horsepower was achieved with the use of modified cylinders, valves, and two digital engine control units (DECUs). If the DECUs sensed a fuel flow disruption, they would reduce engine power to idle. Examination of the wreckage revealed that there was adequate fuel on board. The fuel and fuel filter were absent of contamination. The engine was started and ran continuously for approximately 10 minutes. According to the pilot, who was also the owner of the helicopter, the fuel line was routed next to a hot water line, and a radiator hose was used to separate the two lines. During the accident flight, just prior to the loss of engine power, the pilot noted that the engine was hot, the water temperature was 210 degrees Fahrenheit (F), and the oil temperature was 165 degrees F. The pilot added that the water temperature should only usually be about 10 degrees F hotter than the oil temperature. He believed that heat from the water line caused a vapor lock in the fuel line.

The auxiliary fuel tanks had been placarded inoperative. Visual inspection confirmed the tanks were half-full at the conclusion of the flight. The accident flight took off and was aloft for approximately 1.7 hours. It, too, was an instructional flight. According to a tape recording and transcript of radio communications, the instructor reported they would be entering a right downwind for runway one eight, flying a single engine pattern. Shortly thereafter, he called the pilot of an airplane that was in front on them and asked, \"Can we get priority to the runway? We've got a difficulty.\" The consensus of 27 witnesses was that the airplane made a steep right turn from base leg to final approach, and then it descended vertically to the ground, exploded on impact, and burned. Measurements taken indicated the landing gear was retracted and the flaps were extended 5 degrees. It was noted that when the rudder was aligned with the vertical stabilizer, the rudder trim tab was fully deflected to the right. Measurement of the rudder actuator confirmed this observation (left rudder). The right aileron trim tab was deflected full up (aileron down, wing up).  Measurement of the elevator trim tab actuator indicated the tab was 15 degrees down (elevator up). According to the Cessna Aircraft Company, this is about half of the total deflection range. Disassembly of the engines revealed no anomalies. Components and accessories were bench tested and found to operate satisfactorily within service limits. Disassembly of the propellers revealed neither propeller was feathered. The left propeller was at the low pitch stop, and the right propeller was just past this position (low power). According to the airplane's Climb Data and Cruise Performance Charts, each engine will consume between 14.9 and 26.6 gallons per hour (gph) at 7,500 feet msl and under standard atmospheric conditions, depending on power setting (manifold pressure and rpm). During climb between 5,000 and 7,500 feet msl, each engine will consume between 6.2 and 7.5 gph (depending on power setting). Airworthiness Directive 69-15-09, entitled \"To Prevent Fuel Starvation During High Angle Descent,\" was issued to mandate compliance with Cessna Service Letter ME69-19, entitled \"Minimum Fuel and Power Setting Placards.\" The service letter stated (in part), \"Operation with less than five gallons of fuel in each main tank is prohibited. Useable fuel in each tank is 45 gallons. Maintain power within the green arc during descent.\"",

The Pitts was owned and operated by Attitude Aviation of LVK, while the Cessna was operated by West Valley Flying Club (WVFC) of Palo Alto, California. None of the two persons on board either airplane was injured. Both flights were conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. According to the certified \u00a0flight instructor (CFI) in the right front seat of the Cessna, he was providing a flight checkout for the private pilot in the left seat. Their flight originated from Palo Alto Airport of Santa Clara County (PAO) and they had landed uneventfully on LVK runway 25L. They exited 25L to the south at taxiway G, and called LVK ground control (GC) for a clearance to taxi back for a takeoff on 25L. The airport was reportedly busy, and after a minute or two, having not received a response from GC, they initiated another radio call. During that transmission they heard \"a lot of noise\" coming from the rear of their airplane, and realized that their airplane had been struck in the empennage by the propeller of another airplane. According to the CFI in the front seat of the Pitts, he was providing aerobatics instruction to the pilot in the rear seat. They landed uneventfully on 25R, and exited 25R to the south at taxiway G. The airplane stopped between runways 25R and 25L, and radioed LVK GC for clearance to cross 25L and taxi back to the Attitude Aviation facility. The two pilots in the Pitts watched an unspecified Vans airplane land on 25L, and saw that airplane stop and exit 25L to the south at a taxiway before (east of) their position. LVK GC then cleared the Pitts across 25L, but the controller did not advise them of the Cessna holding just south of 25L on taxiway G. The Pitts taxied across 25L. Due to the tailwheel configuration and limited forward visibility of the Pitts, neither pilot in the Pitts was aware of the presence of the Cessna until the Pitts' propeller struck the empennage of the Cessna. After their airplane was struck by the Pitts, the Cessna pilots requested and received GC clearance to taxi to the ramp, which they did. The Pitts shut down in place, and the pilots exited the airplane. After some preliminary scene documentation, the Pitts was relocated clear of the traffic movement area. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) information indicated that parallel runways 25R and 25L were 5,253 and 2,599 feet long respectively. Examination of the airport layout revealed that the two runway centerlines were separated by about 500 feet, that the Pitts and Cessna were initially separated by about 400 feet, and that the collision location was about 2,600 feet from the air traffic control tower. The LVK 1353 automated weather observation included wind from 240 degrees at 4 knots; visibility 10 miles, clear skies; temperature 29 degrees C; dew point 1 degree C; and an altimeter setting of 29.93 inches of mercury.\u00a0",

The operator anticipated the flight would last between 0.5 and 0.7 hrs.

The weather observations indicated two layers of clouds with multiple base layers from 3,600 feet above ground level (agl) and a broken ceiling about 6,000 feet agl. After departure, the pilot told an air traffic controller that he was looking for a hole to get above the clouds.

Six minutes after departure, witnesses on the ground observed the airplane descending in a \u201cflat spin.\u201d The recorded data from the airplane\u2019s onboard electronic flight information system showed that the pilot had climbed to about 6,858-feet pressure altitude (about 5,800 feet agl) while letting the airplane\u2019s airspeed decay from about 220 knots to about 76 knots, at which time the airplane entered a spin. The data showed that the airplane completed about seven 360-degree rotations in the spin before it impacted the ground. Further, the data indicated that the airplane\u2019s engine was operating normally, and after the first 360-degree rotation,\u00a0the propeller rpm dropped from about 1,800 to 1,000, consistent with the pilot feathering the propeller.

The airline transport pilot is presumed fatally injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight, operating under instrument flight rules, originated from Waukesha County Airport (UES), Waukesha, Wisconsin, at 1043 central daylight time and was destined for Manassas Regional Airport (KHEF), Manassas, Virginia.A review of preliminary radar data revealed that the airplane took off from the departure airport and climbed to an altitude of 21,000 feet msl before leveling off. The airplane maintained this altitude for approximately one hour before descending to an altitude of approximately 13,100 feet msl. According to air traffic controllers, communication was lost with the pilot at 1300 EDT. The airplane traveled into restricted airspace near Washington D.C., and was intercepted by two North American Aerospace Defense Command intercept aircraft.

Immediately after it rolled to the side, flames appeared in the cockpit, but the pilot was able to escape out of the left side of the helicopter. A post-accident teardown inspection of the engine and drive assembly revealed that the upper main drive pulley bearing, a double ball bearing assembly, had partially disintegrated, leading to the decoupling of the main rotor shaft drive from the engine output drive shaft. The upper ball bearings were loose in the assembly, and their retaining cage had been destroyed. All of the subject bearings displayed excessive wear, flat spots, and significant thermal damage.

The airplane touched down on all three landing gears then bounced, then after the second touchdown, the CFI applied rudder input and the airplane departed the runway onto grass.  Evidence of a hard landing was noted.  The yoke weld assembly was found completely fractured approximately 5.5 inches up from the bottom; that point was also located was approximately 5/32 inch above the yoke pivot point.  Extensive corrosion from the fracture location down approximately 3 inches was noted on the forward and left sides of the exterior surface of lower separated piece of the yoke weld assembly when viewed as installed in the airplane.  Extensive corrosion was also noted on the lower end of the yoke weld assembly which contains a rod end bearing and is the attach point for the elevator push/pull tube; the rod end bearing was not free to move.   No drain hole was found in the separated lower portion of the vertical tube of yoke weld assembly.  Corrosion was also noted on the pilots and copilots gusset areas of the yoke weld assembly.  The interior of the separated lower portion of the vertical tube appears filled with a substance mainly comprised of iron and oxygen.  Debris from the separated upper portion of yoke weld assembly did not contain significant inorganic material; an abundance of iron oxide was noted.  Small leaves, metal shavings, fasteners, grass, and dirt was found on interior surface of lower fuselage skin in cockpit area; some of the same type of debris (small leaves, grass, and dirt) was found inside the battery box.  Mold was found on the cockpit side of the firewall insulation blanket (white and green powder).  Examination of the two sections of the yoke weld assembly by personnel from Cessna Aircraft Company indicate that the wall thickness near the separation point was reduced to near zero.  The material was correct and the hardness tests of the tubing revealed they were greater than the minimum specified values.  Evidence of water marks were noted on the upper portion of the separated vertical tube of the yoke weld assembly.

Neither crewmember saw any ice on the wings, and the crew did not activate the deicing boots.  The approach seemed normal until reaching approximately 100 feet above ground level, when the crew experienced what the copilot described as a \"burble,\" and the airplane rolled \"steeply\" to the right.  The pilot stated that there was \"no buffet and no warning.\"  The crew attempted to recover, but were unsuccessful, and the right wingtip struck the runway overrun area. Postflight inspection revealed \"light rime ice\" on the wings, horizontal stabilizer, and radome. The airplane was certificated for flight into known icing conditions, but no ice detector, or stall warning system was installed.  The Citation 500 was certificated with full span deicing boots on the wing leading edge, but this airplane had been modified with  electrically heated anti-ice panels on the inboard wing leading edge.  The deicing boots had no automatic or continuous mode.  Both pilots had taken Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved systems training for the Cessna 500. The pilot stated that he had heard about \"ice bridging,\" at the training provider and his company. The copilot stated that \"unless you have 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice\" the boots should not be activated.  A review of the Cessna model 560 airplane flight manual (AFM) revealed that like the Cessna 500 operating manual, it advised pilots to wait for ice to build before inflating the pneumatic de-icing boots. Both the study guide and the AFM stated that, \"Early activation of the boots may result in ice bridging on the wing.\"  In 1996, the FAA conducted icing evaluations of the Cessna 560. These evaluations resulted in modifications to the stall warning system to increase stick shaker speed in icing conditions, but did not change the procedures for pneumatic de-ice boot operation. In 1997, the Safety Board recommended that, \"leading edge deicing boots should be activated as soon as the airplane enters icing conditions because ice bridging is not a concern.\"  A 1997 industry workshop reported that there was no substantiation for the phenomenon of ice bridging. In 1999, the FAA proposed several airworthiness directives (ADs) on 17 airplane models (including Cessna 500, 501, 550, 551, and 560 ) that would have required manufacturers to change the AFMs so that pilots would be required to inflate de-ice boots as soon as ice accumulation began. Cessna Aircraft Company succeeded in convincing the FAA to withdraw the proposed ADs. In December 2002, the FAA issued advisory circular AC 91-74, which stated that there were few, if any, documented cases of ice bridging on modern boot designs.  In February 2005, the Safety Board investigated an icing accident involving a Cessna 560, and review of the AFM again revealed guidance that stated that the pneumatic de-icing boots should be activated when ice is 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. In December 2006, the FAA released a report stating that test results supported \"the activation of lifting surfaces\" deicers at the first detection of ice formation on the aircraft's lifting surfaces and for the operation of pneumatic deicers in an automatic cycling mode.\" Although more than 10 years have passed since it was established that ice bridging does not occur, the FAA has not taken any regulatory action, and Cessna Aircraft Company has only removed the references to ice bridging in it's AFMs but, still advises to wait until the ice thickness is 1/4 to 1/2 inch before activating the surface de-ice.  Since 1982, the Safety Board has investigated 43 icing occurrences involving turbine-powered airplanes.  These events have resulted in 201 deaths and 16 serious injuries. In the past 4 years, the Safety Board has issued 18 recommendations and one Safety Alert related to icing. As of June 2008, actions to reduce dangers to aircraft flying in icing conditions remain on the Safety Board's 10 Most Wanted List.  The Safety Board has classified the FAA response to this issue as \"Unacceptable.\" ",
            "probable_cause": "The inadequate guidance and procedures provided by the airplane manufacturer regarding operation of the pneumatic de-icing boots. Also causal was the Federal Aviation Administration's inadequate directives which failed to require manufacturers to direct flightcrews to immediately operate pneumatic deicing boots upon entering icing conditions."

She was unable to regain control before the airplane collided with a ditch.The airplane had recently been purchased, and the pilot did not have any flight time in the make and model prior to the purchase. The airplane had been modified with larger/taller main landing gears, larger diameter tires, and a tailwheel assembly from another model of airplane. The pilot said that when the previous owner demonstrated the airplane, he used heavy braking and excessive thrust to get the tailwheel to straighten out. He told her he always did wheel landings as opposed to three-point full stall landings. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the rotational plane of the tailwheel was not horizontal/parallel to the ground. There was a pronounced negative camber (aft downward tilt), which caused the tailwheel to rotate forward when weight was applied. The tailwheel spring had been extended aft from its normal position, which added additional negative camber. An engineer from the Federal Aviation Administration aircraft certification office said adjustments to the tailwheel should have been made to make the tailwheel's plane of rotation horizontal.An examination of the airplane's airframe logbook revealed that the airplane's landing gear had been modified under a supplemental type certificate and multiple field approvals. The airplane had been inspected for maintenance conformity, but not engineering.Due to the multiple landing gear modifications, it is likely that the airplane's landing characteristics were degraded, requiring greater pilot vigilance and skill, particularly during landing.",

A fire fighter pilot at 3V0 said the winds were out of the west at 20 knots.  The fire fighter pilot said that runway 33 slopes uphill, and that the winds coming off the hills to the west present difficulties to airplanes that don't have the power to climb.  \"We takeoff on 33 and settle over the valley there.  If you keep going, you get into rising terrain and then into the canyon.  If you can't climb there, it's done.\"  The results of FAA toxicology testing of specimens received from the pilot showed the presence of 0.85 (ug/ml) cyanide in the blood.  Normal blood cyanide concentrations are less than 0.15 ug/ml, while lethal concentrations are greater than 3 ug/ml.  Entering the \"Climb Speeds and Rates vs. Standard Altitude\" chart in the airplane's Owner's Handbook with a density altitude of 7,001 feet, provides a rate of climb of approximately 315 feet per minute.

The flight was conducted under visual flight rules, but weather conditions in the area were low ceilings and reduced visibility due to rain, fog, and mist. There is no record that the pilot received a weather briefing. The pilot advised an air traffic control tower specialist at the destination airport that he was about 10 miles southwest of the airport for landing. Moments later, a faint emergency locator transmitter signal was detected. No further radio contact from the pilot was received. The next day, the wreckage was found in an area of mountainous terrain about 6 miles southeast of the airport. A postaccident examination disclosed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane. Examination of the pilot's portable global positioning system (GPS) receiver revealed that he was apparently following a straight-line flight path from the departure airport to a secondary airport that was close to the larger, primary (destination) airport. This flight path was directly over mountainous terrain, whereas a track from the departure airport to the primary airport would have been over lower terrain. It is unknown if the pilot was aware he was flying toward an airport other than his proclaimed destination. The purpose of the flight was to take his wife to the primary airport to connect with a scheduled commercial flight that was due to depart only 43 minutes from the time the accident occurred.          Given the lack of mechanical deficiencies with the airplane, the absence of any distress communications, and the pilot's self-induced pressure to get his wife to the airport to avoid missing her flight, it is likely the pilot flew into instrument meteorological conditions while tracking his portable GPS receiver to the wrong destination and subsequently collided with mountainous terrain.",

Shortly after takeoff, the pilot made a right turn, followed by a left turn.  The airplane impacted the ground in a vertical descent 900 feet southeast of the airport.  A second witness at the airport reported that the pilot refueled, started the airplane and departed with a tailwind without completing a preflight inspection or run-up.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the engine oil filler door was bent with the secure latch found pushed in.  Upon removal of the engine cowling, there was evidence of oil on the inside.  The oil filler cap had separated from the oil filler neck and it was found at the base of the engine. Examination of the oil filler cap revealed that the gasket was missing.  When the oil filler cap was fitted to the filler neck, it rotated 360 degrees and would not fit securely.  Search efforts did not locate the gasket in the wreckage or surrounding area.  Some sections of separated windshield glass also showed evidence of oil deposits. Inside the airplane were five one-quart bottles of AeroShell 10W50.  All except one bottle had burst open.  The opened one was empty and the cap was intact with a broken seal..  The reported winds at the time of the accident were from 330 degrees at 7 knots.  Examination of the airplane and engine did not disclose any evidence of mechanical malfunction. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering back toward the runway resulting in an inadvertent stall.  Also causal was the pilot's inadequate preflight inspection which resulted in his failure to secure the oil filler cap.  A contributing factor was his diverted attention. "

He checked the engine oil pressure indicator, and confirmed it was displaying a normal oil pressure. He then altered his flight path to include areas suitable for performing a forced landing. He continued to monitor the oil pressure as he approached an airstrip. The oil pressure did not change, and he decided to continue the flight to his destination. Shortly thereafter, the oil pressure dropped to zero, and the engine lost all power. The pilot performed a forced landing; however, during the landing roll out, the airplane struck a ditch and nosed over. Inspection of the engine revealed that the number four cylinder exhaust pushrod O-ring seal had failed, which allowed the oil to exit the engine, causing the engine to seize. The pilot stated that he had removed the cylinder head 2 years prior to the accident, and reused the exhaust pushrod O-ring seal. According to the engine manufacturer's maintenance manual recommendations, all sealing rings, gaskets, securing elements, O-rings and oil seals are to be replaced at engine reassembly.",
            "probable_cause": "A total loss of power due to an oil exhaustion induced seizure of the engine. The pilot's decision to continue flight to the original destination after becoming aware of the in-flight oil leak instead of landing at an intermediate airport to investigate the source and extent of the problem is also causal. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's reuse of the pushrod oil seal during maintenance in contradiction to the engine manufacturer's maintenance instructions."
