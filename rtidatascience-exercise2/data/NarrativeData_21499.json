Both witnesses reported that the engine initially idled rough. Shortly after takeoff from runway 34, the pilot informed the air traffic controller that he needed to return to the airport and requested runway 16. The pilot declared an emergency but did not state the reason why. The airplane impacted trees and terrain about 1 mile from the approach end of runway 16. The cockpit and cabin sections were found inverted and mostly consumed by a post-crash fire. The wreckage path through the trees indicated that the airplane was established on a shallow glide angle when the impact occurred, with the landing gear and flaps retracted. A disassembly and examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2 cylinder piston head exhibited severe thermal deterioration consistent with a pre-ignition or detonation event. The electrodes of the No. 2 cylinder spark plugs were fully imbedded with aluminum and appeared incapable of producing a spark. The other five cylinders appeared to be functional and were undamaged. The left magneto was set to 30 degrees before top dead center (BTDC); the manufacturer's specification was 22 degrees BTDC. The right magneto was broken at its mount and its timing could not be verified. Examination of the engine maintenance records revealed that the magnetos were last retimed during an annual inspection about 27 months before the accident. The airplane was flown infrequently since the engine was installed in 2007.The airport was equipped with noise abatement monitoring microphones that captured the airplane on the outbound and inbound (return) legs during the accident sequence. Although the engine appeared to be running just prior to impact, the engine sound pressure recorded on the outbound leg was significantly greater than on the inbound leg, suggesting that the pilot was approaching the airport at a reduced power setting.

He entered into an autorotation to make a forced landing and tried to regain engine torque and rotor speed, but was unsuccessful and the low rotor horn sounded again. He lowered the collective and flared for landing. The helicopter came down in trees, with the main rotor blades contacting the treetops. The helicopter was equipped with an on board video recording system that also recorded audio channels. Sound spectrum analysis of the audio recording confirmed the main rotor system speed decay consistent with the pilot's report. The power plant mechanical components: Hydro-Mechanical Unit (HMU), Digital Engine Control Unit (DECU), Engine Back-up Control Ancillary Unit (EBCAU), and Anticipator System Collective Potentiometer (XPC) were tested individually and no abnormalities were found within any component. Visual inspection of the DECU-XPC wiring harness showed very little external damage. Further examination and testing of the wiring harness revealed a loss of internal shielding continuity and shorts between a wire and the shielding. No evidence of lightning strike damage was found in any of the wiring. Faults in the manufacturing assembly of one of the XPC harness backshells were also discovered. Further examination and testing revealed the insulation breakdown was a result of wire damage due to a tight bend in the harness, located about 80 and 90 cm from the rear of the connector (potentiometer side). It was discovered that the AS350B3 and EC130B4 XPC cables (a part of the aircraft wire harness) had been manufactured with extra length to accommodate multiple installation configurations. The length of the accident helicopter's harness was longer than necessary, and it had been bent in a tight radius during aircraft production to accommodate the extra length in during installation. The wiring faults resulted in a gradual, intermittent decay of the XPC signal to the DECU. A review of the DECU design with the manufacturer confirmed that the DECU logic would not detect the XPC signal shift error, such as occurred in this event, which would cause an uncommanded and undetected loss of rotor speed. The aircraft flight manual only contains emergency procedures for a decrease in main rotor speed below 360 rpm when it corresponds with an engine failure. The aircraft flight manual does not address an intermittent XPC signal failure.As a result of the investigation, on March 13, 2009, Eurocopter issued Alert Service Bulletin No. 76.00.18, which called for a modification to eliminate the potential for NR drop in flight - Slow drift in the XPC anticipator (collective pitch signal) on AS350B3 and EC130B4 helicopters.",

The only difference between that aborted takeoff, and the uneventful previous flight, was the addition of 3,000 to 4,000 pounds of fuel.  Following that aborted takeoff, the airplane underwent a maintenance inspection which did not reveal any discrepancies pertaining to the inability to rotate.  The airplane was then returned to service.  When the incident captain arrived at the airport, he was informed of the previous aborted takeoff.  The incident captain attempted a takeoff on a shorter runway at the airport.  During rotation, the airplane did not respond to elevator inputs, and the captain aborted the takeoff.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various sources and may not have traveled in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft incident report.While on approach to landing, the first officer (the pilot flying) called for the landing gear to be extended. The captain placed the gear handle in the down position and waited for the three landing gear down-and-locked annunciator lights to illuminate. Although the \u201cNOSE\u201d and \u201cRH\u201d annunciators illuminated fully, only the \u201cL\u201d side of the \u201cLH\u201d annunciator for the left main landing gear (LMLG) appeared to be illuminated (each annunciator has two light bulbs). During the landing roll, the airplane began to wobble, and the LMLG collapsed. An examination of the airplane revealed that the nose landing gear (NLG) actuator end cap, which was found on the runway, failed due to fatigue from multiple origins that propagated from the inside diameter toward the exterior of the cap. The end cap failure, which likely occurred once the NLG reached its down and locked position, allowed most of the hydraulic fluid to be blown out of the NLG actuator, resulting in a decrease in hydraulic system pressure before the LMLG could reach the full down-and-locked position (the LMLG is the last in the system to receive a pressure pulse). No premishap mechanical deficiencies were noted with the LMLG system that would have precluded it from operating normally if sufficient hydraulic pressure had been available. However, because the loss of hydraulic pressure also disabled the manual landing gear extension system, the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) procedure for the flight crew to manually extend the gear would have been ineffective in securing the LMLG. The investigation identified safety issues related to the failure mode and inspection procedure for the NLG actuator end cap. Metallurgical examination of the NLG end cap revealed that the fractured NLG end cap\u2019s grain was not in the optimum longitudinal direction. (Grain direction in the metal\u2019s microstructure affects its tensile properties and resistance to fatigue stresses.) The NLG end cap was manufactured before the specifications were revised to indicate a longitudinal grain direction for the part. Also, evidence indicates that the fatigue crack was likely present when the end cap was overhauled in 2008 and during a routine inspection of the airplane in 2010; however, the dye penetrant inspection performed during the overhaul did not detect the crack, which would not have been detectable during the visual inspection of the airplane (because the crack had not propagated to the outside of the end cap). As a result of this investigation, the airplane\u2019s maintenance manual was changed to recommend ultrasonic inspections and overhauls for the NLG end cap at specified cycles.Another safety issue was identified regarding the illuminated appearance of the LH annunciator in the cockpit. According to the system design, when the LMLG is not down and locked, the indication circuit is not complete, and the LH annunciator lights will not be illuminated in the cockpit. However, examination of the incident airplane revealed that an incorrect lamp module, which did not have a light dam, was installed in the center position. As a result, light from the illuminated \"R\" (in the adjacent annunciator) was able to bleed over and give the appearance that the \"L\" was also illuminated, providing the flight crew with an erroneous indication that the LMLG was down and locked. The investigation examined other factors that influenced the flight crew\u2019s belief that the LMLG was safe and the captain\u2019s decision to continue the approach. The captain noted that, after he placed the gear handle down, the landing gear in-transit light stayed on and that the gear motor continued to run for about 16 seconds before the gear-motor relay circuit breaker popped, but he stated that he was confident that the illuminated \u201cL\u201d indicated that the LMLG was down and locked. The captain also noted that the gear unsafe warning horn sounded just before touchdown, but he stated that he was not concerned about the horn and elected not to go-around and run the QRH checklists because he had confirmed several times that the gear annunciator lights were illuminated, and he had visually confirmed that the landing gear appeared to be down and locked. Both crewmembers stated that their training told them that if at least one light was illuminated for each annunciator, the landing gear was safe. The captain reported that, about 3 weeks before the incident, he had experienced erroneous gear in-transit light and warning horn indications in another airplane that had resulted from a wiring problem.  The QRH procedure, LANDING GEAR MANUAL EXTENSION, states that the failure of the landing gear to fully extend may be indicated by several things, including the red in-transit light and the warning horn; however, it also states: \u201cBecause there are two redundant gear-down annunciators for each gear leg, failure of only one green gear-down annunciator to illuminate does not indicate that the gear is unsafe.\u201d  The operator\u2019s director of flight standards stated that the company does not train for situations that would involve three illuminated gear down-and-locked lights in conjunction with other gear warnings. As a result of this incident, the operator revised its Flight Standards Manual and training modules.",
            "probable_cause": "The fatigue failure of the nose landing gear (NLG) end cap, which resulted in insufficient hydraulic pressure to secure the left main landing gear into the down and locked position. Contributing to the fatigue failure was the NLG end cap\u2019s non-optimum grain direction and the inadequate inspection procedure performed during overhaul."

Carbon deposits on the valve stem provided evidence that the engine had been operated for some period of time in this condition.  Examination of the left turbocharger revealed that it was not rotating at the time of the accident; however, its turbine wheel blades displayed foreign object damage, more than likely resulting from portions of the separated exhaust valve head passing through the turbocharger.

The airplane had undergone an annual inspection 3 weeks prior to the accident with no discrepancies noted.  After reaching the accident airport environment, the pilot retarded the throttle and noted the airspeed was 120 knots with a loss of manifold pressure.  The engine continued to run, but was not producing power.  The landing gear is self-activating, and when the airplane slows below 105 knots indicated and the throttle is less than half full, the landing gear will automatically extend.  A safety mechanism is in place, so if the throttle is full forward and the airspeed drops below 105 knots, the gear will not extend.  The pilot contacted the tower to inform them of her situation, and that she would be able to make the airport with no further problems.  Simultaneously, the airspeed fell below 105 knots and the landing gear extended with the throttle in the full forward position.  When the airspeed fell below 80 knots, the pilot knew she was not going to clear the railroad tracks and power lines.  She made a shallow left turn to fly underneath the power lines and attempted a forced landing on a road.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the throttle cable rod end had separated from the throttle body attach point disconnecting the linkage between the throttle and engine.  It was noted that the cotter key and jam nut were missing from the assembly and were unable to be located.  Further investigation revealed that the throttle cable assembly had been replaced 7 months prior to the accident.  It was also noted that the assembly was not from the manufacturer, but is widely used in the industry.  The manufacturer reported that they do not authorize any substitutions of their parts. ",

The witness reported that the second landing attempt was successful and that the airplane was then taxied back to the beginning of the runway for another takeoff. During the accident approach, the airplane was observed flaring too high and banking left. One witness stated that the pilot added power and categorized the subsequent climbout as very shallow just before the airplane impacted an antenna and terrain. A postimpact fire ensued. Examination of the wreckage revealed no abnormalities or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.Review of flight school records revealed that the student pilot's first solo flight was 4 days before the accident and that the flight was 0.8 hour long. It could not be determined if the first solo flight was considered the student pilot's supervised solo or if the accident flight was considered the supervised solo. The flight school's standard operating procedure was to \"completely go through all requirements twice\"; therefore, although the accident flight was the student pilot's second solo flight, it should still have been supervised by the flight instructor.The flight instructor reported that the student pilot was scheduled to fly about an hour earlier than when the accident flight initiated; however, due to work requirements, the student pilot had to delay the flight. The flight instructor stated that the student was \"upset\" about the delay. He said that they conducted three takeoffs and landings together, which took about 30 minutes, and that he then exited the airplane for the student pilot's solo flight. The flight instructor reported that, when the student pilot departed on the solo flight, he witnessed a \"beautiful\" landing and then went inside to check on another student. He subsequently observed the student pilot conduct more landings, which he categorized as \"good.\" A cell phone was located inside a thermally damaged case. The cell phone was found off; however, when activated, it indicated that a missed call occurred around the time of the accident. According to the manufacturer, the cell phone may overheat and shut down when exposed to high temperatures and will not register a call when powered off. Therefore, it is likely that the cell phone was on and that the pilot was aware of the incoming call when it was received. Although the investigation could not determine if the student pilot had become distracted by a cell phone call, the flight instructor further stated that the student was very focused on learning but that he was distracted when his cell phone rang. However, the flight instructor did not require the pilot to turn the cell phone off during flight. The flight instructor was in a position of authority and operational control and should have taken steps to ensure that the student was not distracted by the cell phone while flying.",

The specialist suggested that the pilot not depart immediately because of the weather, but said that it might be possible to land at an intermediate stop ahead of the weather, possibly in Pensacola or further north in the Crestview area. The pilot filed an IFR flight plan from Cornelia to Pensacola at 16,000 feet. The pilot called the AFSS again and requested an IFR clearance. The specialist responded that the clearance was on request, and that he would work on the void time and placed the pilot on hold. The specialist obtained the clearance from Atlanta Center and returned back to provide the clearance to the pilot. The pilot was not on the telephone line. The pilot departed Cornelia without an IFR clearance and contacted Atlanta Center. The controller informed the pilot on initial contact that he was not on his assigned heading, altitude, correct transponder code, and subsequently handed the pilot off to another controller. The flight was subsequently cleared direct to Panama City, Florida, and the pilot was instructed to climb to 16,000 feet. Atlanta Center broadcasted weather alerts over the radio frequency the pilot was on for Center Weather Advisory 101, SIGMETS 73C, 74C,and AIRMET Sierra between 0903 to 0913 CDT.

Witnesses reported that the airplane descended in a near vertical attitude from the overcast, striking a highway curb lane about .75 miles from the airport.

An examination of the autopilot annunciator module indicated that the HDG, NAV, AUTOTRIM and FAIL warning lights may have been illuminated. When the autopilot detects a trim system failure, the trim servo is deactivated and the AUTOTRIM and FAIL warning lights will flash. The AUTOTRIM light will also flash if the trim master switch is turned off, making the autopilot system evidence inconclusive.Because the autopilot system evidence was inconclusive, the role of the autopilot in the accident could not be determined.

When the flight instructor informed the pilot that his flight training would be postponed for about two weeks, the pilot agreed to wait. The flight instructor cautioned the pilot not to attempt to fly the airplane until he had received adequate training, to which the pilot agreed. Subsequently, the pilot elected to fly the airplane without having received any flight instruction. During the takeoff, witnesses reported observing the airplane climb rapidly, followed by a left wing low, steep nose down attitude prior to impacting the ground with its left wing, consistent with a stall/spin. According to the flight instructor, the airplane's 19-meter wing, known for its lifting capacity, most probably caused the inexperienced pilot to think that he was airborne, when the airplane was only light on its wheels, resulting in the pilot pushing out on the control bar thinking he would climb out. However, not having enough airspeed to sustain flight, the wing stalled. No pre-impact anomalies were reported with the airplane.",

The next day he returned to the island a few hours late due to weather on the mainland, and he and his friends ate lunch. While dining, the pilot noticed that the weather was deteriorating rapidly and suggested that they depart before instrument meteorological conditions prevailed. After boarding the airplane and starting the engine, the pilot conducted an abbreviated engine run-up during the taxi. The takeoff roll was normal, but about 2 to 3 seconds after liftoff, the left engine failed, and the airplane veered to the left. The pilot pushed the nose down to maintain airspeed, and the airplane entered a cloud/fog bank, impacted terrain, and was engulfed by fire. Postaccident examination of the left engine and propeller did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. On scene, the fuel selector valve for the left engine was found set between \"OFF\" and its normal takeoff setting. The mechanical configuration of the selector valve and linkage made it unlikely that the valve setting was altered by impact forces, particularly since the surrounding airplane structure remained intact. The left engine was tested at the engine manufacturer's facility where it operated normally and developed full-rated takeoff power. Testing of the left fuel selector valve revealed that, in its as-found position, it was incapable of delivering the required fuel flow to the engine at takeoff power. The pilot stated that it was his habit to shut off both fuel selector valves after each flight and that he did so after the previous landing. Residual fuel in the lines, gascolator, and carburetor, combined with the limited flow capability of the mis-set selector valve, permitted the engine to be started and operated normally at low rpm. However, the high fuel flow demand of the engine operating at full power could not be maintained by the mis-set valve, and the engine failed in the initial climb due to fuel starvation. The pilot's decision to attempt the departure with the rapidly deteriorating weather caused him to hasten his activities. Had the pilot not been in a rush, it is likely that he would have properly set the left engine fuel selector valve. He also would have conducted a full and/or longer engine run-up, which would have failed the engine before the takeoff attempt if he hadn\u2019t properly reset the left engine fuel selector valve. While the pilot took the initiative to create a personal checklist, he missed the opportunity to improve upon the existing manufacturer's checklist. The pilot's personal checklist appeared visually and functionally inferior to the manufacturer's checklist, and it did not include any double checks of such flight-critical items as fuel selector valve position.",

A videotape of the accident sequence showed the airplane as it flew down the valley and proceeded to make a fire retardant drop.  When the drop was almost completed, the airplane's nose began moving up, and the airplane started to arrest its descent and level out.  The nose of the airplane continued to rise, and the airplane's wings folded upward until they detached from the fuselage at the center wing box beam-to-fuselage attachment location.  Close examination of the video revealed that the right wing folded upward first, followed by the left wing about 1 second later.  Metallurgical examination of the center wing box lower skin revealed a 12-inch long fatigue crack on the lower surface of the right wing beneath the forward doubler, with two separate fatigue crack initiation sites at stringer attachment rivet holes (which join the external doubler and the internal stringers to the lower skin panel).  The cracks from both initiation sites eventually linked up to create a single crack. The portion of the wing skin containing the fatigue crack was covered by a manufacturer-installed doubler, which would have hidden the crack from view and, therefore, prevented detection of the crack from a visual inspection of the exterior of the airplane.  The investigation found that the airplane was probably operated within the maximum takeoff gross weight limits specified in the airplane flight manual.  The airplane was delivered new to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) in 1957 and was retired from military service in 1978.  The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) acquired it from the USAF in 1988 for use as a fire suppression tanker.  Between 1978 and 1988, it was kept in a desert storage facility. It was transferred to a civilian contractor for firefighting operations and modified for that role, then sold to a Part 135 operator. The airplane was certificated by the FAA in the restricted category under a type certificate held by the USFS.  A Lockheed study concluded that firefighting missions were substantially more severe than typical military logistics operations and aircraft operated in this role would require inspection intervals as much as 12 times more frequently than typical military transport usage for meeting damage tolerance requirements.  Concerning the detectability of the cracks, Lockheed reported that nondestructive x-ray inspection methods in current industry and military depot level maintenance processes could have detected, with high confidence, the fatigue cracks when they were 0.50 to 0.75 inch long.  Inspection intervals appropriate for this detectable crack size can be determined from a damage tolerance crack growth analysis; however, this requires an extensive knowledge of the operational loads environment and internal stresses of the C-130A wing such as would be found in a military depot level maintenance program. The operating limitations accompanying the restricted certificate specified that it be flown and maintained in accordance with the then-current (1988) USAF technical orders for the C-130A.  The USAF depot level maintenance program was not included in the maintenance technical orders and was not individually specified on the certificate's operating limitations.  The limitations letter did not specify compliance with USAF maintenance program modifications/amendments in technical orders issued after 1988.  The operator devised a maintenance and inspection program based on the specified USAF maintenance technical order but did not develop a depot level inspection requirement to ensure continued long-term airworthiness and damage tolerance that would account for the stresses on the airplane resulting from its new firefighting role and the increasing age of the airplanes.  Investigation found that there are five separate FAA-issued type certificates owned by five separate firms for the C-130As used as tankers.  Although the five certificates have similar maintenance requirements, none are standardized, there is no depot level maintenance program specified for any of them, and none require full compliance with all military airworthiness technical orders.  In 1991, the Department of Interior (DOI) began to doubt the continued airworthiness of the C-130A firefighting tanker fleet and was specifically concerned that the lack of a depot level maintenance program or any requirement for compliance with all military airworthiness technical orders could compromise the safety of the airplane.  The DOI asked the FAA to standardize the type certificate for the C-130A and mandate improvements in the maintenance and inspection requirements.  In a written opinion, the USAF agreed and urged the FAA to mandate that operators establish a depot level type continuing airworthiness program for the airplane and mandate compliance with all technical orders.  In a series of meetings held in 1993, FAA management internally agreed that the DOI and USAF positions held merit and began to develop requirements.  In late 1993, in a meeting between the FAA, DOI, USFS, and the airplane operators, the USFS and the operators objected to the idea of depot level maintenance programs and full compliance with all technical orders on the basis of the potential economic impact of these requirements.  As of the time of the accident, the FAA had not standardized the existing five type certificates nor had they imposed any additional maintenance or inspection program requirements.",
            "probable_cause": "the inflight failure of the right wing due to fatigue cracking in the center wing lower skin and underlying structural members.  A factor contributing to the accident was inadequate maintenance procedures to detect fatigue cracking."

The pilot/owner and his passenger received minor injuries. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no FAA flight plan was filed for the flight. According to the pilot, he had recently purchased the airplane, and he and his wife planned to fly it from the purchase location in Washington state to their home town of Farmington, New Mexico. The first leg was uneventful, and terminated in a fuel stop at Columbia Gorge (DLS), where the pilot topped off the fuel tank. The next planned fuel stop was in the vicinity of Provo, Utah, and the pilot conducted the cruise portion at an altitude of 9,500 feet above mean sea level (msl). When the airplane was about 30 miles from Provo, the pilot began a gradual descent, and shortly thereafter, the engine quit. He switched from the main tank to the auxiliary tank and attempted to restart the engine, without success. The pilot then turned his attention to selecting an off-airport landing site, located an open field and turned off all electrical items. The airplane landed hard, and \"flipped over on its back.\" The pilot exited, assisted his wife with her exit, and both walked away from the airplane because they smelled fuel.

Because of the clouds that had moved into the area, the pilot likely could not distinguish ground cues that would have helped him determine the airplane's attitude. Without an instrument rating, the pilot was unable to use his flight instruments to help him successfully orient and land the airplane. No anomalies were noted with the airframe, flight controls, flight instruments, engine assembly and accessories.",

The flight was descending through 12,400 feet about 45 miles west of FLL at the time of the encounter.  The airplane was not damaged.The flight crew reported that on initial descent into the Fort Lauderdale area they noticed typical Florida summertime cumulus cloud conditions.  About 20 minutes before the event, the Captain appropriately briefed the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for landing early and to be seated after completing the initial clean-up. The flight crew subsequently illuminated the seat belt sign during the descent.  The flight attendants were still in the process of preparing the cabin for landing when the turbulence was encountered.During descent, the airplane passed in and out of cloud formations.  The crew described, and CVR data is consistent with, passing out of a cloud and noticing a larger developing cumulus in front of them.  The autopilot and autothrust were engaged.  The crew reported that the radar did not indicate any echoes ahead of them.  The Airbus weather radar system includes a Turbulence detection function, which was not used by the crew.  The Airbus flight crew training manual describes effective mode, range, and tilt settings for detecting \u201cwet\u201d (convective) turbulence.  As the airplane passed into the cumulus development, the airplane encountered convectively induced turbulence, resulting in a peak vertical acceleration of about +2 G and -0.5 G.  The activity was likely developing upwards, possibly below the field of view of the radar, and into the flight path.As a result of the injuries to the forward flight attendant, the flight crew advised ATC that they had an injured crew member and requested priority handling and for paramedics to meet the airplane on arrival.  The ATC approach controller did not forward the request for paramedics.  The crew also attempted to contact the company station agents and dispatch, but received no response.  The lack of ATC coordination, and lack of company personnel to monitor communications from inbound flights, delayed the arrival of emergency medical personnel to meet the flight.",
            "probable_cause": "an inadvertent encounter with convectively induced turbulence developing upwards into the flight path, which was not detected on weather radar as configured by the crew.Contributing to the delay in emergency medical personnel notification was the incomplete coordination of paramedic response by air traffic control and ineffective communications monitoring by Frontier Airlines."

The airplane was equipped with an Ice Protection System that when activated supplied deicing fluid to the wings, tail, and propeller.  The aircraft was not certified for flight into known icing and the Pilot Operating Handbook reads that, \"Flight into known icing conditions is prohibited.\"  The pilot received a preflight weather briefing, which advised that there were no pilot weather reports (PIREP) for the intended route of flight, and that the freezing level in the Reno area was 6,000 feet with no precipitation.  There were no valid SIGMET's or AIRMET's for icing conditions along the pilot's route.  The pilot filed his IFR flight plan for 12,000 feet, but indicated he might request 14,000 feet once airborne.  After takeoff, at 1807:46, the pilot contacted Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and requested to climb to 16,000 feet to try to get above the clouds.  At 1813:40, the pilot reported that he was still in the clouds and asked about going lower.  At 1815:00, the pilot advised ARTCC that if he could go up another 200 to 300 feet, he could get above the clouds.  ARTCC requested clarification if the pilot wanted to go up or down.  The pilot responded that he would like to go up first to build up some airspeed.  The pilot was cleared for a block altitude between 16,000 to 17,000 feet.  About 2 minutes later, the pilot transmitted that he was \"coming down\" and that he was \"icing up.\"  The last transmission from the pilot was at 1817:42, again indicating that he was icing up and coming down.  According to investigators from Ballistic Recovery Systems (BRS), following the examination of the ballistic parachute system, they determined the system was deployed outside of the operating envelope of the system, which is 133 knots indicated airspeed.  An examination of the airplane wreckage did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions.  Analysis of the actual weather conditions encountered revealed the likelihood that the pilot encountered severe icing related to super-cooled large water droplets as the aircraft achieved 16,000 feet and above.  Review of the weather forecast products available at the time of the pilot's briefing disclosed that the AFSS briefing fully conformed to Federal Aviation Administration standards and adequately covered the observed and forecast weather conditions.  Although post accident analysis of the weather conditions showed the clear likelihood of severe icing conditions, the algorithms used by the NWS Aviation Weather Center to predict icing conditions showed only a low probability of icing in the area, and, in the absence of PIREPs to the contrary, an icing forecast was not triggered.",

The second pilot said that the pilot's airplane had a heavier engine than most of the type did, and had a \"full panel\" of instruments and radios and was equipped for instrument flight.  The pilot told him that, with the heavier engine and instrumentation, he was \"over gross\" with himself, baggage, and fuel onboard.  He was carrying camping gear and the density altitude at the accident site was approximately 8,000 feet.  After takeoff, the pilot was flying below and in front of the second pilot at an altitude that placed him below the canyon walls.  The second pilot radioed to him \"you should climb,\" and the pilot radioed back that he was taking pictures.  About 1 mile further, it appeared that the pilot started climbing.  He was keeping even with gently upsloping terrain ahead and was in no danger at that point.  The pilot then made a right turn into a narrow canyon that would take him across a ridgeline toward a scenic canyon.  Flying behind him, it took the second pilot a moment to reach the entrance to the canyon and, when he did, he was immediately uncomfortable.  Even from his higher altitude the second pilot was barely level with the ridgeline ahead.  He radioed to the pilot that he should \"do a 180 . . . there is room to your right.\"  At this point he had sufficient space to his right to reverse course.  The pilot radioed back words to the effect that he thought he could make it and would proceed ahead.  The second pilot radioed that he was turning immediately and that the pilot had plenty of spacing and was clear of terrain.  When he started his climbing left turn he last saw the accident airplane below and in front of him, hugging the left canyon wall.  It appeared the pilot was setting up to make a right turn out of the canyon.  He appeared to be in a climbing attitude.  When the second pilot completed his 360-degree turn, he next saw the airplane in a 45-degree right bank as it entered a spin to the right at about 300 feet agl.  The spin continued for 2 1/2 turns and the airplane impacted terrain below and a fire erupted.  It appeared that the spin slowed and a partial recovery was made just before the impact.  In the immediate area where the accident occurred the canyon was closing; there was rising terrain ahead and insufficient canyon width to turn around.

The copilot noticed fluctuations with the engine indications, and called for an abort.  Power was reduced to idle, and the pilot corrected to the left using left rudder pedal and braking.  The airplane turned to the right again, and the pilot corrected to the left.  The airplane continued to turn left, and departed the left side of the runway, tail first, and was substantially damaged.  The airplane had accrued 18,040.3 total hours of operation.  It  was powered by two turbofan engines, each equipped with an electronic fuel computer.  Examination of the left engine's wiring harness revealed that the outer shielding on the fuel computer harness assembly was loose, deteriorated, and an approximate 3-inch section was missing.  Multiple areas of the outer shielding were also chaffed, the ground wire for the shielding was worn through, and the wiring was exposed.  Testing of the wiring to the fuel computer connector, revealed an intermittent connection.  After disassembly of the connector, it was discovered that the connector pin's wire was broken off at its crimp location.  Examination under a microscope of the interior of the pin, revealed broken wire fragments that displayed evidence of corrosion.  Simulation of an intermittent electrical connection resulted in N1 spool fluctuations of 2,000 rpm during engine test cell runs.  According to the airplane's wiring maintenance manual, a visual inspection of all electrical wiring in the nacelle to check for security, clamping, routing, clearance, and general condition was to be conducted every 300 hours or 12 calendar months.  Additionally, all wire harness shield overbraids and shield terminations were required to be inspected for security and general condition every 300 hours or 12 calendar months, and at every 600 hours or 24 calendar months.

The captain initially stated that the airplane was on the ILS approach with the engine power set at flight idle.  About 300 feet above the ground, and 1/4 to 1/2 mile from the threshold, the captain made visual contact with the runway.  The captain stated that the left engine then surged, which caused the airplane to yaw right and drift left.  At the time, the airplane was in visual conditions, and on glideslope, with the airspeed decreasing through 106 knots.  The captain aligned the airplane with the runway and attempted to go-around, but the throttles were difficult to move.  The airplane began to stall and the captain lowered the nose.  The airplane subsequently struck terrain about 500 feet prior to the runway.  After the captain was informed that the engine power should not be at flight idle during the approach, he amended his statement to include the approach power setting at 1,000 lbs. of torque.  The co-pilot initially reported that the engine anomaly occurred while at flight idle.  However, the co-pilot later amended his statement and reported that the anomaly occurred as power was being reduced toward flight idle, but not at flight idle.  Examination of the left engine did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  Examination of the airplane cockpit did not reveal any anomalies with the throttle levers.  Review of a flight manual for the make and model accident airplane revealed that during a normal landing, 1,100 lbs of torque should be set prior to turning base leg.

The pilot reported that prior to the flight he performed performance calculations for the airplane to ensure that it was capable of departing the higher altitude airport.  Performance calculations indicated that with the gross weight near the specified maximum, the airplane would need about 4,500 feet to take off.  Prior to departure, the pilot configured the airplane with the flaps retracted and the mixture control in the full forward (rich) position.  The Safety Board calculated gross weight of the airplane was 2,767 pounds (117 pounds over the airplane's maximum certified gross weight of 2,650 pounds).

According to one witness, as the helicopter overflew his position, he observed the main rotor blades rotating very slowly to the point where they were coning and each blade could be viewed individually.  This witness observed a tan smoke emanating from the transmission area.  The helicopter then \"fell like a rock,\" and impacted the ground.  The witness indicated he heard the engines surging when he reached the accident site.  Another witness did not hear any engine noise as the helicopter passed overhead.  A post crash fire consumed the cabin, main transmission case, and, heavily damaged both engines.  A post-accident examination of the helicopter revealed the main rotor and tail rotor blades sustained little to no leading edge damage though the helicopter fell through 150-foot pine trees.  The number 1 engine displayed no rotational damage to its internal components.  The number 2 engine sustained heat and tip rub damage to the 1st and 2nd stage gas turbine blades in a manner that suggested the damage occurred while the rotors were rotating.  Numerous components from each engine were completely destroyed by the post-accident fire and could not be examined.  The main rotor transmission case was nearly burned away.  The exposed transmission gears displayed no signs of pre-existing anomalies; however, complete continuity of the transmission could not be established due to thermal damage.

The instructor made an off-airport emergency landing in soft terrain, and the airplane nosed over. Postaccident inspection disclosed ample fuel and no preimpact mechanical problems. The front seat pilot related that he did not have the carburetor heat on until the loss of engine power occurred, and the instructor told him to turn it on. He also said that there were low, wispy clouds in the area.  A local weather report indicated that the temperature was 57F, and the dew point was 52F.  When these values are entered into a carburetor icing probability chart, the results are in the \"Serious Icing\" category. Carburetor ice likely formed inside the carburetor, which resulted in the loss of engine power. Carburetor heat becomes ineffective once the engine has lost power.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor's delayed instructions to apply the carburetor heat, and his inadequate supervision. A factor contributing to the accident was carburetor icing conditions."

He reported that he flew the final approach between 72 and 74 knots and that he reduced engine power as the airplane crossed-over the runway numbers.  He stated that the stall warning horn sounded as he flared, but the aircraft did not descend onto the runway.  He reduced his yoke back pressure and the airplane landed hard on the runway.  The airplane then proceeded to bounce several times before stabilizing on a landing rollout.  An after-flight inspection revealed that one of the propeller blade tips was curled from contact with the runway and that the engine firewall was substantially deformed.",

Application of the left brake had no effect. The airplane skidded, exited the runway, struck a runway marker, and collapsed the nose landing gear. The steering actuator had failed, the hydraulic fluid was lost from the steering actuator, and the fuselage received structural damage. The steering actuator assembly, p/n 1501-4,  had accumulated 5,938.0 hours since new and had not been repaired or overhauled. Examination of the nose gear steering actuator cylinder by the metallurgist revealed that the cylinder fracture was the result of fatigue cracking initiated by an abrupt machining transition from the 45 degree thread ring chamfer to the straight wall of the cylinder. The engineering drawings appear to depict the radius at the fatigue origin as a continuation of the 0.03 inch to 0.06 inch radius adjacent to the fracture. However, the drawing is not clear on the specific intent of the transition between the nearby radius and the internal threads for the nut. ",
