The Cessna entered the pattern on a left base approximately the same time as the SA-750 entered the pattern on a 45 degree entry to a left downwind. The Cessna pilot had the SA-750 in sight as the Cessna was entering the pattern, but the SA-750 pilot never saw the Cessna once the two aircraft arrived in the vicinity of the airport. Although the pilots of both aircraft made all standard position calls while in the pattern, the pilot of the SA-750, which was being flown at 80 MPH on final, failed to maintain sufficient clearance between his aircraft and the preceding Cessna, which was being flown about 65 MPH on final. Subsequently, the SA-750 converged on the Cessna from behind. Shortly after the two airplanes touched down on the runway, they collided. According to the SA-750 pilot, the first time he saw the Cessna was about one second before impact on the runway. ",

The ILS Runway 06 approach was in use.  Braking action advisories were in effect, and all surfaces were covered with thin wet snow.  During the approach to the airport, with the Second-in-Command (SIC) at the controls, the PIC visually observed that the hydraulic pressure gauge, \"smiley face,\" was normal, and he performed a \"brake test.\"  The tower controller advised the flightcrew that a Navajo had just landed and reported a 250-foot ceiling, 3/4 miles of visibility, and that the runway braking action was \"good.\"  On final approach, the airplane broke out of the overcast clouds about 400 feet above the ground.  The runway appeared dry, with only blowing snow across it.  As the airplane touched down about 1,463 feet beyond the approach end of the 4,677-foot long runway on the runway, the SIC stated that she did not have any braking effectiveness, and selected the \"dump flaps\" to slow the airplane.  The airplane continued down the runway and did not seem to be slowing to a safe speed.  The flightcrew observed the 1,000-foot marker approaching and the SIC selected the emergency brakes.  After she felt a lack of deceleration, the SIC selected the parking brake.  The airplane continued off the end of the runway, impacted a non-frangible fence, and came to rest with about 4 feet of the airplane protruding onto a public access road.  Examination of the airplane revealed a reference speed set on the pilot's airspeed indicator of 117 knots.

The airline transport pilot received fatal injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of the 14 Code of Federal Regulations as a Part 91 airshow flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the airshow demonstration flight that departed from EZZ about 1330. No flight plan was filed.  The pilot's flight demonstration card used during the airshow indicated that the pilot planned to do 10 aerobatic maneuvers during the flight. For the ninth maneuver, it indicated that he planned to do a Lomcevak maneuver. An airshow pilot who was familiar with the accident pilot's airshow routine, reported that the accident pilot intended to do a 45-degree knife-edge climb, perform the Lomcevak maneuver, and then continue the knife-edge climb. Video recordings taken by persons on the ground showed the airplane flying through the planned routines. Between the eighth and ninth aerobatic maneuvers, the videos showed the airplane doing a course reversal, and then flying straight and level before entering into a knife-edge climb. During the knife-edge climb, the airplane appeared to enter the Lomcevak maneuver by doing a climbing snap-roll to the left. Then the nose of the airplane pitched down and the airplane tumbled two times to the left while descending. The airplane appeared to enter a left spin and completed about two and a half revolutions before it impacted the terrain.   The airplane impacted the trees and terrain in a shallow nose down attitude with a high vertical descent rate. The engine compartment, fuselage, wings, and empennage remained intact and there was no post impact ground fire. The engine compartment exhibited upward crushing, and the leading edges of the wings did not exhibit aft crushing. Flight control continuity was confirmed from all flight control surfaces to their respective cockpit controls. The elevator trim continuity was confirmed from the elevator trim tabs to the elevator trim control. The engine will be shipped to the manufacturer for an engine teardown examination.

The instrument rated pilot departed on the 81 nautical mile (nm) flight and shortly thereafter began receiving visual flight rules (VFR) flight following services.  There was no indication that he had ever flown that route prior to the accident flight.  The cross-country flight path consisted of flying over level terrain for the first half, with the remainder of the flight crossing over several mountains (the last of which was the mountain the airplane impacted).  The pilot regularly flew over level terrain for his commute to work.  A regular passenger on those commuter flights (a coworker) reported that there were numerous times when the pilot would fly through a layer of clouds in an effort to descend down to the destination airport.  The radar returns and voice tapes of the pilot's communications revealed that the airplane began a gradual descent about 18 nm prior to impact.  The majority of the radar returns were all spaced uniformly and followed an anticipated route for the cross-country flight.  The area in which the radar returns were lost is a typical region for air traffic controllers to lose radar contact with aircraft due to the surrounding terrain.  The airplane's radar-derived ground speed was close to that expected for cruise flight according to the airplane manufacturer's owner's manual.  The last radar target observed was about 1.45 nm from the accident site at the same altitude where the wreckage was located.  Instrument meteorological conditions were forecasted over the mountainous areas near the destination airport.  A pilot who was flying in the vicinity of the accident site stated that he was on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan around the time of the accident.  He recalled that the cloud tops were about 5,000 feet mean sea level (msl) and the bases were about 3,000 feet msl.  He noted that the mountains in the area were obscured, but did not observe any unusual or hazardous meteorological conditions.

She took off, with a flight instructor in the right seat, on a cross country flight that landed uneventfully at the outbound destination.  She did not note any mechanical anomalies during the landing or taxi.  The return leg, at night, was also uneventful; however, when turning onto the downwind leg, the private pilot advised the flight instructor that he needed to land the airplane because she wasn't sure of  the \"perspective.\"  The flight instructor took over, and the private pilot kept her hands and feet off the controls while observing the nighttime runway environment.  The flight instructor turned onto the base leg, then onto the final leg.  The airplane appeared to be lined up with the center of the runway, and the private pilot turned on the landing light.  The airplane landed on both main landing gear, with the flight instructor \"holding the nose wheel off.\"  The private pilot could not see out the front window, but it appeared that the airplane was veering to the right.  She then heard the flight instructor say \"oh shoot\" and \"something about the rudder.\"  The airplane then \"hit something\" and bounced, but veered back to the left and stopped in the center of the runway.  According to the flight instructor, during the return cross country leg, he noticed a few times that the airplane was deviating left of the intended heading.  At some point, the private pilot stated that she couldn't trim the airplane.  The flight instructor tried to trim it, and with the maximum right trim set, he still had to hold right rudder to maintain heading.  The flight instructor maintained a right rudder input for the rest of the flight.   At the destination airport, the weather was \"clear with light to nil wind.\"  On final approach, the flight instructor set the power between 1,700 and 1,800 rpm, and the airplane was stabilized at 70 knots and aligned with the center of the runway, both visually, and with the glide slope and localizer.  The flight instructor held right rudder input, and adjusted the airplane's heading by easing off right rudder or holding it as required to keep the airplane aligned with the center of the runway.  The flight instructor thought about using flaps, but decided not to because he wasn't sure if it might exaggerate the left-turning tendency.  Approaching the runway, the flight instructor noted that the airplane was turning to the right, so he eased off some right rudder.  At some point, he \"totally removed right rudder pressure and started \"the transition approach to land,\" but \"for whatever reason, the aircraft turned to the right suddenly and unexpected.\"  To keep the airplane over the runway, the flight instructor turned the controls to the left, and applied full left rudder, but did not notice any immediate response.  He advised the private pilot and the passenger of what he was doing, and said, \"the rudder is not responding\" while initiating a go-around.  The flight instructor then heard a \"bang\" as if the airplane had struck something, and the impact \"forced the airplane more over and closer to the center if the runway.\"  The flight instructor aborted the go-around, and landed.  After landing, and while taxiing to the ramp, the flight instructor pressed the right and left rudder pedals several times, and noted that the right rudder pedal was much stiffer than the left.  Photographs of the scene revealed three wheel tracks to the right of the runway, consistent with the width of the airplane's landing gear.  The tracks veered off the runway, with the right main landing gear track passing next to the remnants of a 3,000-foot remaining sign.  The tracks then gradually veered back toward the left, and on to a taxiway, toward the runway.  The airplane was subsequently examined for proper rigging, with no significant anomalies noted.",

Although he reported some medications on his Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate applications, he routinely failed to report others. Documentation from his most recent FAA medical examination included the use of two medications not recommended to be used together because of the risk of hypoglycemia. Postmortem toxicology testing identified only salicylate, but would have been unable to identify many of the pilot\u2019s other medications.\u000b\u000bAccording to the medical examiner, the cause of death was multiple blunt impact trauma to the head and chest, indicating that the pilot was still alive when he lost control of the airplane. Diabetics who become symptomatic from hypoglycemia may not notice warning signs until their psychomotor functioning is very impaired. It is unknown what precautions the pilot may have taken that day to prevent hypoglycemia or what the pilot\u2019s eating schedule was. In addition, because postmortem glucose levels are low and do not correlate with premortem levels, even if the pilot was severely hypoglycemic at the time of the accident, there would be no specific evidence to identify it.\u000b\u000bThe pilot also had severe coronary artery disease, with 85-95% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, that put him at increased risk of a sudden, impairing cardiac event that would have left no observable evidence at autopsy.\u000b\u000bThere were no operational or mechanical factors to explain the student pilot\u2019s loss of control at takeoff, but he did have multiple medical conditions that could have resulted in acute impairment without leaving evidence.

According to the passengers they were flying back from Florida when '...motor cut off minutes from runway, started back up again ran for about 20 seconds, shut down again...would not start again.'    Examination of the wreckage revealed that the fuel system was not breached, the fuel pump switch was in the 'ON' position, and the fuel selector was selected to the left tank.  No fuel was found in the tanks, or the fuel lines, and there was no evidence of fuel spillage in the crash area.  There was about '1 ounce' of fuel that was drained from the fuel sediment bowl.

The flightcrew passed the taxiway exit, overran the departure threshold of runway 30, and struck two lights associated with the approach lighting system for runway 12, breaking the lights off at their bases. The airplane was not damaged, and, after being towed from the overrun area, taxied to the gate under its own power. The flightcrew stated to investigators that they observed the runway centerline lights initially alternated red and white and then became all red as they taxied the airplane toward the runway threshold. They stated that they were looking for a right turn to vacate the runway but did not see any green lead-off lights leading to the taxiway. They further stated that they observed a line of red lights about 50 meters (about 160 feet) in front of the airplane, which they thought were part of the stop bar indicating the runway threshold. The first officer started to turn off the runway using the blue taxiway edge lights as a guide, but immediately stopped the airplane when both he and the captain realized the light pattern was not as expected. The investigation revealed that the red lights that the flightcrew observed were obstruction lights mounted on top of an Instrument Landing System localizer antenna, approximately 500 feet beyond the runway threshold. The actual runway threshold was marked with eight red lights, consisting of four lights extending out from each side of the runway edge. The lighting, signage, and airfield markings of runway 30 were operational and in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) specifications; however, the flightcrew did not correctly utilize or interpret these cues to determine their exact location during taxi. The runway 30 centerline lights changed from all white to alternating red and white lights beginning 3,000 feet from the runway threshold and became all red lights beginning 1,000 feet from the runway threshold. The runway edge lights changed from white to amber 2,000 feet from the runway threshold and remained amber until the end of the runway. On the left side of the runway, \"distance remaining\" signs were installed at 4,000 feet, 2,000 feet, and 1,000 feet before the runway threshold. Approximately 500 feet before the runway threshold, on the right side of the runway, a taxiway sign was installed, indicating \"Q\" with an arrow pointing to the right. Approximately 75 feet before the runway threshold, the centerline lights of Taxiway Q began at the runway edge and extended perpendicular to and away from the runway. Additionally, twelve parallel white bars were painted along the width of the runway surface to mark the threshold and yellow chevrons were painted on the blast pad beyond the runway threshold to indicate unusable pavement.FAA advisory material for new runway threshold lighting installations and for reconstruction of existing installations recommends that threshold lights extend from the runway edge inboard toward the center of the runway, and not outboard like those on the incident runway; however, existing installations, such as those on the incident runway, were permitted by the FAA. The taxiway at the end of the runway did not have taxiway lead off lights extending to the center of the runway, but the taxiway did have centerline lights beginning at the runway edge, per FAA requirements. Although the flightcrew said they were confused by the location of the runway threshold lights, they had numerous other indications available to identify their position on the runway, all of which were in compliance with FAA guidance. Each of these indications would have been visible from the cockpit and are intended to help the flightcrew navigate without incident. However, the flightcrew did not heed the numerous lighting, signage, and airfield markings for runway 30, and instead focused on lights that were located well beyond the runway threshold to the exclusion of all other indications.",

About 4 hours into the flight he attempted to contact air traffic control in order to verify his position; however, he was unable to establish contact.  At that point, he began \"to lose confidence in [his] present position\" and decided to establish a heading he believed was toward his intermediate fuel stop.

Shortly thereafter, dark smoke entered the forward area of the passenger cabin.  The crew declared an emergency and the flight attendants, with a passenger's assistance, cut a hole in the overhead panel, and discharged the contents of two hand held fire extinguishers.  The airplane landed uneventfully and an emergency evacuation was conducted without incident.  Examination of the airplane revealed that a deactivated navigational antenna located in the tail cone had been struck by lightning.  Attached to the antenna were two coaxial cables, which were tie-wrapped together, fed into the cabin, and attached along the upper left hand side of the fuselage between the insulation blankets and overhead panels.  The cable ends were observed to be mechanically cut and had been fastened above row 7AB, in the area of the most fire damage.  The insulation to the right of the cable ends was cratered and burrowed.  The cable ends were not protected or grounded.  The cables had been cut and partially removed in accordance with an engineering change order (ECO) developed by the operator, so a more advanced system could be installed.  According to the procedure, the cable ends were to be covered with heat shrink tubing or other suitable material.  Fifty-seven of the operator's 259 MD-80 airplanes had undergone the partial removal of the cables, and 21 airplanes still had the full Omega antenna system installed.

He had been compensating for a crosswind estimated by himself and his instructor to be around 10 knots, and from the left side of the runway, 21R.  This compensation was accomplished using a forward slip, with the left wing down into the wind and right rudder.  In the past his instructor had noted problems with the student's execution of forward slips, and attributes the accident to the student not maintaining adequate wind correction.  At the time of the accident, winds at the airport were from 250 degrees at 13, gusting to 18 knots.  Measurements from in the hours preceding the accident and hours after the accident show differing angles of crosswind direction but similar speeds and gusts.  The airplane's performance charts indicate that a 13-knot crosswind would have been experienced under such conditions, and states that maximum demonstrated crosswind to be 15 knots.  The Chief Flight Instructor stated that he would solo a student in a maximum of \"7 to 10 knots of crosswind,\" but only if the student had been performing exceptionally well.  The school's curriculum sets no crosswind limits for students on their initial supervised solo flights.",
            "probable_cause": "The student pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions and failure to maintain directional control.  Also causal was the flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight in allowing the student to perform a solo flight with a strong, gusting crosswind near the factory demonstrated crosswind component limit.  Factors to the accident were the gusty crosswind conditions, and a lack of flight school standards pertaining to student pilot supervised solo flights in challenging weather conditions."

Examination of the wreckage and the accident site showed that the airplane collided with mountainous terrain while in a wings level cruise flight attitude.  The autopilot switch was found in the ON position.  The noninstrument rated private pilot departed in VFR conditions with three passengers for a 134-mile trip to celebrate one passenger's birthday at a fly-in restaurant destination. There were no records of the pilot having received weather briefings from any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities.  Recorded radar data showed that instead of flying a direct route the airplane meandered towards a mountain top VOR navigational aid and eventually was about 18 miles off a direct course between the departure and destination airports.  About 30 minutes into the flight, the airplane had reversed course and was headed back towards the open desert departure area when radar contact was lost.  A moderate north-south surface pressure gradient produced strong, gusty northerly low-level winds over the higher elevations of the mountain range.  Observations from satellite imagery indicated that mostly clear skies were present from the departure airport until the accident airplane reached the vicinity of the accident area.  A weather satellite visible image showed that cloud cover from the northwest did cover the accident site around the estimated time of the accident though there were clear areas south and west of the VOR.  Cloud bases reported around the VOR ranged from on the surface to less than 1,000 feet agl, with tops generally 8,000-10,000 feet mean sea level (msl) in the area.  No in-flight advisories (SIGMET or AIRMET) were valid for the accident location when the accident airplane departed.  However, AIRMET TANGO was updated at 1335, to include a forecast of occasional moderate turbulence below 12,000 feet over coastal mountain areas.  According to pilot reports from very near the accident area around the time of the crash, moderate turbulence and up and down drafts were being experienced from 500 feet to 1,200 feet per minute.  There are two small lakes in the vicinity of the VOR.  Overflying one lake on the accident flight's last radar observed heading would take the airplane over low terrain on a route back toward the departure airport, whereas overflying the second lake on the last observed heading would take the airplane toward mountainous terrain that rises to 5,430 feet msl within 2 miles, and is the location of the accident site.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning/decision by his VFR flight into IMC, and his failure to maintain terrain clearance.  Contributing factors were mountainous terrain, low ceilings, and turbulence."

He stated that the right tanks tested fine but he found 'an estimated total of a gallon of water from the two left tanks.' The flight with a fuel stop was uneventful.  On the day of the accident, he pre-flighted the aircraft and 'drained about 1/2 cup of water from the left side'.  The first leg of the trip was flown at 12,000 feet MSL, and he refueled. The aircraft then departed, and the flight was cleared to climb to flight level 240.  He reported the outside air temperature as -27 degrees Celsius.  Shortly thereafter, he noticed a little engine roughness.  He executed a number of trouble shooting procedures attempting to correct the problem without success.  Approximately 5-7 miles from the airport the engine ceased developing power.  He then executed a forced landing under dark night conditions to an unlighted landing site.

The pilot was cleared for the instrument landing system approach into the airport.  During the descent, the airplane was below the glideslope but tracking the localizer.  The pilot contacted the air traffic control tower controller and was cleared to land.  The last recorded radar target for the airplane was at 1,600 feet mean sea level (msl) and the initial impact occurred at 1,400 feet msl.  The radar data indicated that the target maintained a descent rate of about 1,100 feet per minute during the last minute of flight and was flying at a radar derived ground speed of approximately 112 knots.  Though the en route controller received a minimum safe altitude alert (MSAW), he had transferred control of the airplane 1 minute prior to the receipt of the initial MSAW alert.  However, the airplane crossed a named intersection at 3,300 feet msl after it was cleared to cross the intersection at 4,000 feet msl while under the en route controller's control.  The en route controller did not advise the pilot of the altitude deviation.  The air traffic control tower controller did not issue an MSAW to the pilot, even though the equipment was configured to receive MSAW alerts.

The calculated bank angle for the entire flight never exceeded 30 degrees and at the time of the accident, the airplane was climbing at 500 feet per minute through 2,800 feet and had accelerated to 100 KCAS. The estimated angle of attack was about 3 degrees during the last minute of the flight. There was no evidence of excessive airspeed or maneuvers that would lead to a structural overload and subsequent breakup. The wreckage was spread over 600 feet. An examination of the airplane wreckage revealed compression buckling of the upper and lower caps of both rear spars and upward and downward bending of both wings. The upward and downward movement, twisting, and flexing of the airplane wing surface was consistent with the occurrence of aerodynamic flutter. The structural loading at the wing roots were further increased as the trailing edges of the outboard sections moved up and down. Ultimately both wings failed in down bending at the root. The ailerons did not have counterbalances that offer direct protection from aerodynamic flutter. Aerodynamic flutter can occur when there is insufficient stiffness in the structure or the flight controls are not mass balanced. Less stiff structure can be protected to higher airspeeds with the use of counterbalances on the flight controls.

Upon reaching the destination airport, the weather conditions included an overcast ceiling at 300 feet and 2 miles visibility in drizzle, which were worse than the forecast conditions of overcast ceiling at 1,000 feet and 6 miles visibility. The pilot diverted to his planned alternate airport and attempted an instrument landing system approach. Given the lack of a fuel stop, the pilot may have felt personal pressure to land the airplane as soon as possible. The airplane initially intercepted the localizer for the approach, but did not intercept the glideslope. The airplane then proceeded left of course, above the glideslope, followed by a continued left deviation and descent below the glideslope. The tower controller asked the pilot if he was still on the localizer course and the pilot replied that he was not. The tower controller then provided heading and altitude instructions in an attempt to guide the pilot onto a missed approach. The pilot acknowledged the heading instruction, but failed to turn to the assigned heading or climb to the assigned altitude. The airplane subsequently impacted a residential area about 1/2 mile from the runway. The pilot's logbook was not recovered and a determination of his flight experience in actual instrument conditions could not be made. According to a flight instructor, the pilot had owned the accident airplane for about 6 months and had 80 to 90 hours in the make and model. The pilot completed an instrument proficiency check with the instructor about 1 month prior to the accident. The instruction included many instrument approaches and missed approach procedures. Additionally, the flight instructor concentrated on attitude flying, which was not the pilot's strongest skill.Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions. If neither horizon nor surface references exist, the attitude of an airplane must be determined by artificial means from the flight instruments. However, during periods of low visibility, the supporting senses sometimes conflict with what is seen; when this happens, a pilot is particularly vulnerable to disorientation. Postmortem toxicology testing noted findings consistent with marijuana use; however, no blood was available for toxicological testing and it was not possible to reliably estimate when the marijuana may have most recently been used or whether the pilot may have been impaired by such use.",

The interior surfaces of the clutch housing displayed a large amount of oil.  The clutch assembly was found to be without mechanical disparities and within normal wear limits.  The release of the oil jet would have allowed engine oil to flow through the 3/8 inch threaded orifice into the lower transmission and clutch housing at a significantly higher rate than through the small diameter orifice in the end of the oil jet, resulting in disengagement of the clutch.

The two foreign certificated pilots and two passengers were fatally injured. The repositioning flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the planned flight to Providenciales International Airport (MBPV), Providenciales, Turks and Caicos.The twenty-one-seat airplane, serial number UC-47, was manufactured in 1988. It was powered by two Pratt and Whitney Canada PT6A-65B, 1,100 horsepower engines, equipped with four-blade, controllable-pitch, Hartzell HC-B4MP-3C propellers. Review of maintenance records revealed that the left engine propeller had been due for overhaul. It was removed and replaced with an overhauled propeller prior to the accident flight and the accident flight was the first flight after the overhauled propeller was installed on the left engine. Review of radar and communication data from the Federal Aviation Administration revealed that the flight was cleared for takeoff at 1436:45. At 1438:15, one of the pilots reported an \"engine failure\" to air traffic control. The controller asked the pilot if he would like to return to the airport and the pilot replied affirmative. The controller then offered a 180-degree turn to runway 9R and the pilot requested a left traffic pattern to runway 27L, which the controller approved; however, the airplane subsequently impacted a utility pole and terrain about 2 miles west of the runway. Review of radar data revealed that six targets were recorded during the accident flight. The first target was recorded at 1438:18, at an altitude of 200 feet mean sea level (msl) about 1,000 feet beyond the departure end of runway 27L. The next three targets indicated a slight left turn at 300 feet msl. The fifth target indicated a continued slight left turn at 200 feet msl. The last target was recorded at 1439:19, indicating 100 feet msl, next to the utility pole that was struck. Witnesses observed the airplane flying low, with the left wing down and the left propeller turning slower than the right propeller, before the airplane impacted the utility pole. The airplane came to rest upright in a field against several trees, oriented about a magnetic heading of 110 degrees. The beginning of a debris path was observed near a severed utility pole where scrape marks across the adjacent road were consistent with left wingtip contact. Additionally, sections of left propeller blades were located near the utility pole and along the debris path, consistent with the left propeller impacting the utility pole as the left wingtip was scraping the ground. The debris path extended about 240 feet, on a magnetic heading of 240 degrees, to the main wreckage. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and cabin. The horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer, elevator, and rudder remained intact and were charred. The left and right wing mid-sections had been consumed by fire. The wing flaps and landing gear were in the retracted position. The right propeller remained attached to the right engine and all four composite propeller blades separated at the hub. The right engine exhaust duct exhibited torsional bending and compression. The left propeller remained attached to the left engine and two of the four composite propeller blades had separated at the hub. The other two blades separated about 1 foot from the hub. The left engine exhaust duct exhibited some compression. Both engines and propellers were retained for further examination. The airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, which were forwarded to the NTSB Recorders Laboratory, Washington, D.C., for readout. The recorded weather at KTMB, at 1453, was: wind from 030 degrees at 5 knots; sky clear; visibility 10 miles; temperature 23 degrees C; dew point 10 degrees C, altimeter 29.96 inches of mercury.",

The flight instructor (CFI) was not injured, and the student pilot sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local instructional flight, which departed Venice Municipal Airport (VNC), Venice, Florida. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. In a written statement to the Federal Aviation Administration, the CFI indicated that, after completing maneuvers at 2,000 feet, he initiated a simulated engine failure. He selected a field as a forced landing location, and carburetor heat was applied. After turning onto final approach for the selected field at an altitude of about 500 feet, the CFI turned off the carburetor heat and applied engine power to end the simulation and initiate a climb. The engine \"sputtered and produced no power,\" and the CFI conducted a forced landing to the field. Upon touchdown, the left wing contacted the ground and the airplane \"cartwheeled.\" The airplane came to rest upright, and the CFI and student subsequently egressed. Postaccident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to both wings and the forward fuselage. There was no fuel observed in either of the airplane's two wing fuel tanks; however, fuel quantity at the time of the accident could not be determined as a fuel line was damaged during impact. The airplane was subsequently removed from the site, the starter was replaced, and an auxiliary fuel supply was plumbed into the airplane's fuel system. The engine started immediately, accelerated smoothly, and ran continuously without interruption and with no anomalies observed.",

The airplane was registered to and operated by Aerial Viewpoint Aerial Photography under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a positioning flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The flight departed the David Wayne Hooks Memorial Airport (KDWH), Houston, Texas, and was en route to the Austin Executive Airport (KEDC), Austin, Texas.A preliminary review of communications revealed that the pilot had contacted air traffic control and was receiving flight following while en route to his destination. Prior to reaching KEDC, the pilot radioed his intention to descend. There was no further communication with the pilot or any reported distress calls.Several residents near the accident site reported hearing or seeing the accident airplane flying low, although none of them observed the accident sequence. A local landowner heard the airplane impact terrain and called 911.The airplane was located in an open pasture with rolling terrain. Impact signatures were consistent with a near vertical impact.

He performed two takeoffs and landings without incident. Before the third takeoff, the pilot verified that the flaps were retracted for takeoff and that the left fuel tank was selected. The pilot applied power to take off and released the brakes. As the airplane rolled down the runway, it lifted off the ground, and then settled back onto the runway. The pilot stated that he continued to apply full power but that the airplane was not performing as well as on the previous takeoffs. The airplane eventually became airborne. The pilot stated that he initiated a turn to the right in order to avoid striking trees off the end of the runway; the flight instructor subsequently took the flight controls as the right turn became steeper and the airplane began to descend. According to a witness, the airplane appeared like it would not clear the trees, banked right, and then entered a spin before impacting the ground. Postaccident examination of the fuel selector revealed it was in a mid-range position, with neither the left or right tank selected. When the fuel selector was placed to the center position, similar to where it was found after the accident, fuel would not flow through the fuel selector. Thus, it is likely that the pilot did not turn the fuel selector completely so that it was not locked in the detent, which restricted fuel flow and resulted in a loss of engine power. In addition, the main fuel line and the return fuel line were removed and there was no fuel present. A postaccident engine teardown was performed and the fuel manifold was disassembled; dry rot was noted on the manifold diaphragm and it was leaking. The leak might have reduced fuel consumption, but not a significant amount. It is likely that, because of the loss of engine power, the airplane would not have been able to adequately climb above the trees off the end of the runway. Therefore, the pilot attempted to avoid the trees and initiated a turn during the initial climb, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and subsequent spin.Although postaccident testing indicated that the flight had adult-onset diabetes, it  could not be determined if the flight instructor experienced symptoms from the condition or side effects from the medication that treated the diabetes, which could have hindered his ability to operate the airplane. Furthermore, the flight instructor did not report the diabetic condition or medications on his most recent application for an Aviation Medical Certificate. ",

After making one pass and returning, witnesses stated that they saw the airplane impact the top of a tree, fly out of sight, and then heard the sound of an impact. The son arrived on scene, removed the pilot from the wreckage, and attempted CPR, but to no avail. Toxicology tests showed the pilot's blood and urine had alcohol levels of 123 mg/dl and 206 mg/dl, respectively. ",

During final approach, the airplane encountered a strong downdraft and the canopy extended to the full up position. The pilot was unable to reach the canopy handle to close it, and the airplane landed hard, likely due to the drag created by the open canopy. The left horizontal stabilizer and left aileron were substantially damaged.Postaccident examination revealed that the canopy latch did not always fully engage in the cabin frame during the closing operation; the latching pin would sometimes extend about 5 millimeters short of the 15 millimeters of full travel. Thus, it is likely that the pilot's encounter with a strong downdraft could have caused the canopy to flex and open if the latch was not fully engaged.In 2008, the airplane's manufacturer issued a Mandatory Service Bulletin requiring a revision to the flight manual. The revision stated that, if the canopy locking pin is not securely latched during the pre-flight inspection, the canopy could open in flight. The revision included operational updates specifying procedures for securing an inadvertent canopy opening during various phases of flight. The procedures stated that provided the airplane is flown in a straight and level attitude, the canopy will only partially extend, and could be retracted and locked by hand. The procedures warned that, during uncoordinated flight, the canopy will extend to the full open position, acting as an airbrake and resulting in an excessive descent.",

During the cruise portion of the flight, a total loss of engine power occurred over open water in visual meteorological conditions at 27,000 feet, about 119 miles west of a suitable landing area. During the loss of power, the engine torque indication dropped from the cruise power setting to 0 foot-pounds (ft-lbs) of torque, the engine then began to vibrate, and smoke began emanating from the engine. The pilot ditched the airplane, it sank, and it was not recovered. The pilot and the pilot-rated passenger were rescued by a French Navy helicopter.The pilot said that he had decided to take a direct route instead of staying closer to the island chain between the two airports because he had ferried 3 airplanes down to Brazil in the last year and that it was a judgment call and a calculated risk because the engine was reliable. At the airplane\u2019s planned operating altitude of 27,000 feet, the airplane could have glided about 54 miles; if the route had been planned to take advantage of this glide distance, the pilot could have remained off shore island chain and taken a shorter, although not direct, route. Review of fueling documentation, the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), and statements made by the pilot and pilot-rated passenger also revealed that on the accident flight, good operating practices were disregarded. For instance, during fueling, the airplane which was not equipped with fuel heaters, had been topped off with fuel, but no fuel icing additive had been added, even though the pilot was planning to operate the airplane at 27,000 feet. The airplane was also operated in excess of the manufacturer's published weight limitations, and no power setting or performance information was available for climb and cruise operations in excess of these limitations. Furthermore, according to the pilot, before the loss of engine power, the torque was about 937 ft-lbs. According to the pilot-rated passenger, before the failure, the torque gauge was indicating about 980 ft-lbs. Review of the maximum cruise performance chart in the POH and Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) revealed that both of the stated torque settings exceeded the maximum torque setting listed on the chart. Operating the engine beyond the recommended power settings specified in the POH/AFM for a prolonged period will result in accelerated deterioration due to hot section component distress and will affect engine reliability and durability. ",
            "probable_cause": "The total loss of engine power during cruise flight for reasons that could not be determined because the airplane was not recovered. Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s failure to comply with the airplane and engine limitations, and his decision to fly over water beyond power-off gliding distance from shore."

However, as the airplane climbed about 20 feet above the runway, it wobbled to the left and right and drifted slightly to the left. The pilot subsequently aborted the takeoff. Upon returning to the terminal, the pilot had both passengers exit the airplane, and he then taxied back to the active runway.During the second attempted takeoff, several witnesses observed the airplane begin a normal takeoff roll, lift off about one-third of the way down the runway, and enter a nose-high attitude. The airplane was observed rotating back and forth along its longitudinal axis before entering a steep right turn. Subsequently, witnesses observed the airplane descend into an unoccupied hangar. All of the witnesses reported that the engine sounded normal and appeared to be producing power during the takeoff and accident sequence.Postaccident examination of the accident site and airplane wreckage revealed signatures consistent with a near-vertical impact with the hangar. Examination of the airplane, flight control systems, engine, and propeller revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. At the time of the accident, the airplane was within weight and balance limitations.Review of the pilot\u2019s personal primary care medical records revealed treatment for shift-work sleep disturbance with zolpidem and treatment of hypertension with valsartan. On each visit, the primary physician recorded that the pilot reported no use of drugs or alcohol. Postaccident toxicology testing revealed positive results for losartan (also used to treat hypertension), zolpidem, and buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance used to treat severe pain. The pilot\u2019s primary care medical records did not mention acute or chronic pain or its treatment. Buprenorphine  carries a warning from the Federal Drug Administration that it \u201cmay impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery).\u201d Further, opiates cause, in part, sedation, alterations in cognitive and sensory efficiency, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, headache, and sleep and concentration disorders. With chronic use, tolerance can develop, which mitigates the drug\u2019s effects. Several issues made the interpretation of the toxicology report difficult. Opioids may undergo postmortem redistribution, which may result in postmortem levels not directly reflecting antemortem levels. In addition, depending on the pilot\u2019s pattern of use, it is possible that he had some degree of tolerance for the drug\u2019s effects. Further, his actual dosing interval may not have been the same as the dosing interval noted on the prescription bottle found in the airplane. Thus, it was not possible to determine the exact effects of the drug on the pilot at the time of the accident. In addition, the effects of the underlying chronic pain syndrome on the pilot\u2019s performance are unknown. However, it is likely that the pilot was using a significant amount of opiate medication at the time of the accident, and, therefore, that he was impaired to some degree as a result.",

Minutes later, the airplane, which had just passed abeam the Tracy airport (closest airport to the airplane's location) reversed direction and turned toward Tracy.  During the last 2 minutes of recorded flight, the airplane's descent rate averaged 1,550 feet per minute.  Ground scar signatures were indicative of the airplane impacting terrain in a wings level attitude, and thereafter sustaining structural fragmentation.  The impact occurred on level terrain about 1.3 miles short of the airport.  The engine and propeller were found in a 3-foot-deep impact crater.  Components were found as far as 317 feet from the crater.  There was no evidence of fire.  The pilot maintained his airplane on an annual inspection basis, and he had flown it since manufacture in 1998 for a total of 220 hours.  He had made 64 flights in the airplane during the preceding 12 months.  The pilot was reportedly in good health.  The radar track plot provided evidence that the pilot successfully negotiated a course reversal turn and was initially able to head toward the nearest airport.  The pilot was, however, unable to arrest the 1,550 foot-per-minute rate of descent.  No evidence was found in the fragmented wreckage regarding the reason for the steep descent to ground impact. ",

He reduced engine power and pushed the nose over to start the descent.  At around 2,000 feet, oil and grease covered the windscreen and the engine lost power due to the propeller separating.  He performed emergency procedures, and at about 1 mile from runway 29, he had to sideslip the aircraft in order to see out in front and to lose airspeed.  The aircraft touched down at around the midpoint of the runway and was going too fast to stop.  The airplane rolled off the end of the runway into a ditch causing the nose landing gear to collapse.  Examination of the aircraft revealed both propeller blades were separated and not located.  The propeller hub which remained attached to the engine was retained for further examination.  Metallurgical examination of the propeller hub revealed no evidence of cracking in the sockets or anywhere else on the hub.  Both sockets exhibited damage to the threads to the same depth (about 2 or 3 threads from the internal end of the threads).  Damage to varying degrees to both sockets was noted circumferentially.  A few remnants of what appeared to be blade threads were found in the socket threads.  No evidence of corrosion deterioration of the socket threads was noted.  Review of the maintenance records revealed that the propeller was last overhauled on January 3, 1996, and was installed on March 10, 1998.  The pilot later reported that following the return to service of the airplane after installation of the overhauled propeller, it would overspeed occasionally during takeoff or cruise.  The rpm would never go more than 200 rpm greater than red line.  When that occurred, he would put a load on the propeller to reduce the rpm.  He also reported intentionally accelerating the airplane on at least 3 occasions to the velocity never exceed speed (Vne) of the airframe in an attempt to induce propeller overspeed, the results were unsuccessful.  The propeller governor was then removed and checked, no discrepancies were reported.  On August 5, 1999, the maintenance records reflect an entry which indicates the propeller was disassembled and the seals were replaced and the blades were backed off 1 notch. The work was performed by the facility that had overhauled the propeller in 1996.  The propeller was reinstalled and dynamically balance checked on June 8, 2002; the vibration was recorded to be .135 inches per second (IPS) and no weight was required.

The passenger said that the airplane did not seem to accelerate very well on the takeoff roll and that the climb rate was marginal. When the airplane was about 100 feet above the ground, the pilot entered a left turn back to the airport with an already reduced airspeed, and an aerodynamic stall occurred. The left wing dropped, and the airplane descended at a steep angle. The pilot was able to level the wings before the airplane impacted the ground.

As he reached to lower it, the left side of the canopy opened. The canopy was moving up and down erratically as the pilot attempted to stabilize it, and the airplane began pitch oscillations. The pilot notified the air traffic control tower controller that the canopy was open and that he needed to return for landing immediately. As the pilot turned onto the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, the pitch oscillations became increasingly erratic. The airplane lost altitude and subsequently collided with power lines, which pitched the airplane upside down into the street below. Postaccident examination of the canopy noted that it was hinged in front of the cockpit and rotated forward when open. Examination of the latch mechanism revealed no mechanical anomalies.The pilot reported that he followed the takeoff checklist and ensured that the canopy was closed and locked by pushing up on it, although this instruction was not in the pilot operating handbook (POH). Further examination of the POH noted a lack of guidance for verifying that the canopy was locked or for operating the airplane when the canopy inadvertently opened. It is likely that during the preflight, the canopy latches could have been partially engaged such that the pilot felt enough resistance to believe that the canopy was locked. The vibration encountered during the takeoff roll and the aerodynamic flow over the canopy at liftoff may have caused the canopy to become loose and open. After the accident, the manufacturer issued guidance indicating that if the canopy opened in flight, it would raise about 2 to 3.2 inches, but the airplane should remain fully controllable.",
