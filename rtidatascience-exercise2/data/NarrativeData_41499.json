There were 86 passengers, 2 flight attendants and 2 pilots aboard the airplane for the scheduled domestic flight.  Ten passengers were treated for minor injuries and released.  Dark night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight for which an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed.  The flight departed from Guadalajara, Mexico, at approximately 2100, with Monterrey as its final destination.  The flight performed two localizer approaches to runway 29.  The first approach resulted in a missed approach.  The accident occurred at the completion of the second localizer approach.Local authorities reported that the landing threshold for runway 29 had been displaced 900 meters due to the construction of a taxiway, leaving 2,100 meters of usable runway.   The precision approach path indicator (PAPI) system had also been relocated to the displaced threshold.  The Vref for the 94,000 pounds landing weight was estimated at 127 knots.  The collapsed nose landing gear came to rest 68 meters beyond the end of the paved overrun area for runway 29.  The accident investigation is under the jurisdiction and control of the Government of the Republic of Mexico.

For the first five minutes of the flight, the Mustang flew in formation with an aircraft being flown by a company official, and then the Mustang demonstration pilot proceeded to an area south of Marsing, Idaho.  The aircraft was observed performing a series of maneuvers in that area under a ceiling that was estimated at 2,000 to 2,500 feet AGL. Recorded electronic engine performance data indicated that the aircraft's throttle was retarded to idle about a minute and forty-five seconds prior to impact.  Witnesses said that after they heard the power reduced, the aircraft climbed for awhile and then began to slow.  As the aircraft's speed became 'very slow' its nose dropped and it lost a few hundred feet of altitude.  After leveling off and slowing again, the aircraft's nose dropped a second time.

During cruise flight while flying at 1,000 feet msl approximately 10 miles from the destination airport , the left engine started losing power, but the airplane did not yaw; the left cowl flap was closed at the time.  The pilot reported the left fuel flow light was on, but the fuel pressure was in the green arc (indicating approximately 38 to 42 psi).  He switched each fuel selector to its respective outboard fuel tank though the outboard tanks were empty, turned on both emergency fuel pumps, and also attempted crossfeeding fuel to the left engine in an effort to restore engine power but was unsuccessful.  The left engine manifold pressure decreased to 18 inHg, and he was maintaining \"blue line\" airspeed plus a few knots with the right engine at full power.  He slowed the airplane to less than blue line airspeed in an attempt to \"gain altitude\", and approximately 2 to 3 minutes after first noticing the loss of engine power from the left engine with the manifold pressure indication of 15 inHg, and after seeing boats nearby, he moved the left propeller control to the feather position but later reported the propeller did not feather.

The flight crew encountered light rime icing on the inbound leg while descending from 9,000 to 5,000 feet. Before the incident takeoff, they reviewed the dispatch package weather and noted two AIRMET (airmen's meteorological information) reports for icing in clouds. The captain decided to perform the departure and turn control of the airplane over to the first officer after completing the climb checklist at the acceleration altitude. In accordance with the operator's minimum equipment list (MEL), the airplane was dispatched with the continuous mode of the boot deice system inoperable, which would require the crew to manually operate the deice boots. Company procedures require activation of the deice system at the first sign of ice accretion, and operation of the deice boots continually thereafter while in icing conditions. The departure was into level 2 weather conditions (defined as 10 degree Celsius or colder with visible moisture).The airline's Airplane Operating manual (AOM) for the airplane calls for computation of a minimum speed (Vcln+15) in icing conditions, which for this flight was 141 KIAS.  The limitations section stipulates that Indicated Air Speed (IAS) is the only authorized flight director/autopilot mode while climbing when ice accretion is occurring or with residual ice on the airframe.  In IAS mode, the flight control computer gives pitch commands to maintain the selected indicated airspeed as opposed to the Vertical Speed (VS) mode where the autopilot sacrifices airspeed to maintain climb rate.  Even though the crew had encountered icing on the inbound leg and the dispatch weather reports predicted an icing encounter during the climb on the outbound leg, the captain engaged the autopilot in the medium (M) climb mode and shortly after taking the controls at 2,500 feet, the first officer changed the autopilot to VS mode.As the airplane climbed through 11,700 feet, the captain noted light rime ice accumulating on the windshield wiper blades and about a 1/2-inch-wide area of ice on the left wing.  During this time, the crew failed to detect a decaying indicated airspeed due to the ice that was accumulating.  As he began to activate the manual deice boot system, he felt a heavy vibration in the airframe and the windscreen immediately turned white with ice. The airplane's nose and left wing dropped and the autopilot disconnected. As he was grabbing the yoke, the clacker sounded (indicating an imminent stall), the stick shaker activated, and the ground proximity warning system emitted a \"bank angle\" aural warning. Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) data showed that the indicated airspeed went from 144 to 130 KIAS over the 26 seconds before the upset, and that the rate of airspeed decay accelerated in the final 10 seconds before the autopilot disconnected. The airplane departed controlled flight at an indicated airspeed of 130 knots, and before the stall warning activated.  The data establishes that the airplane went through a series of roll and pitch excursions, reaching maximum values of 86 degrees left wing down, 140 degrees right wing down, 23 degrees nose up, and 40 degrees nose down before the flight crew recovered control. The data also revealed that about 26 seconds before the stall while the airplane was at a speed of 144 KIAS, the airplane began to experience a likely ice-induced slight rolling anomaly that was counter to the direction of the aileron input.  Aileron input from the autopilot arrested this slight rolling motion.The DFDR data also disclosed that 14 seconds after the initial stall, both ailerons simultaneously traveled to the full up position for approximately 14 seconds. The Safety Board believes that the initial stall that occurred prior to stall warning, the upset, and the aileron upward deflections were caused by ice accreted on the wing in supercooled liquid droplets (SLD) conditions.  Furthermore, the period of simultaneous upward deflection of the ailerons were caused by airflow separations over the ailerons, and not by opposite control wheel inputs by the captain and first officer (FO). This conclusion was based on the similar nature of past experience in accidents and incidents involving modification of aileron forces by SLD ice accretions, the higher airspeed and dynamic nature of the initiating events, the captain's and FO's statements, and the captain removing one hand from the control wheel to reduce the power. Also contributing to this conclusion was extrapolation of aileron and control wheel force measurements obtained in high speed taxi testing with a simulated ice shape in front of one aileron, and the development of airflow separation over the ailerons into a complete full wing stall.RecommendationsThe Safety Board issued several recommendations as a result of the investigation.Urgent recommendation A-06-48 asked the FAA to require all operators of Saab SF340 series airplanes to instruct pilots to maintain a minimum operating airspeed of 1.45xVs during icing encounters and before entering known or forecast icing conditions and to exit icing conditions as soon as performance degradations prevent the airplane from maintaining 1.45xVs. Recommendation A-06-49 and A-06-50 asked the FAA to require the installation of modified stall protection logic in Saab SF340 series airplanes certified for flight into known icing conditions and to require the installation of an icing detection system on Saab SF340 series airplanes.Recommendation A-06-51 asked the FAA to require all operators of turbo propeller-driven airplanes to instruct pilots, to disengage the autopilot and fly the airplane manually when operating in icing conditions. The Safety Board also reiterated the following prior recommendations to the FAA.Recommendation A-03-53 and A-03-54 asked the FAA to convene a panel of airplane design, operations, and aviation human factors specialists to determine whether a requirement for the installation of low-airspeed alert systems in airplanes engaged in commercial operations under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 121 and 135 would be feasible, and if the panel determined that such feasibility exists, establish requirements for low-airspeed alert systems.",
            "probable_cause": "An in-flight loss of control due to ice accreted in supercooled liquid droplets (SLD) conditions, and the flight crew's failure to maintain the specified minimum airspeed in icing conditions.  Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's decision to climb the airplane in known and forecast icing conditions using an autopilot mode contrary to that specified in the operator's Airplane Operations Manual for climbs during periods of ice accretion or when ice was present on the airframe."

Witness interviews and global positioning system (GPS) data revealed that the pilot was performing lazy-eights, over water, about 1 mile south of the beach. The airplane descended to an altitude of 355 feet, reversed course from east to west with its \"smoke on,\" and increased groundspeed to 184 knots. The airplane then climbed to about 1,200 feet and completed three lazy-eight turns. During the third turn, at an altitude of 1,254 feet, the airplane's groundspeed slowed to 66 knots. The airplane stalled and completed a one-half turn spin. The pilot recovered from the spin and was in the process of recovering from the ensuing dive, when the airplane impacted the water. Two of the witnesses were experienced in the accident airplane make and model. They were surprised that the pilot was performing maneuvers low over the water, as the water did not provide any ground reference with regard to altitude, position, or horizon. They also expected the airplane to be about 3,000 feet, while maneuvering, as that make and model airplane needed \"significant altitude\" to recover from a stall or spin. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions.",

He attempted to recover; however, the airplane impacted the ground tail first. Data recorded by the airplane's primary flight display (PFD) indicated that the airplane lifted off at about 61 knots, pitched up from about 9 to 18 degrees nose up, rolled from about 0 to 20 degrees left bank, and stalled about 20 feet above the ground. The PFD data indicated that the airplane impacted in a wings-level, slightly nose-high attitude. The main landing gear separated from the airplane and the tail section partially separated from the fuselage. The pilot attributed the accident to a previously known and repetitive  malfunction of the airplane's electric pitch trim. The airplane's pitch trim system uses a spring cartridge attached to the elevator bell crank and activated by an electric motor. When activated by a switch on the control yoke, the trim motor moves the spring cartridge causing the elevator to move the elevator to a new trimmed position. Postaccident examination of the trim mechanism in the tail revealed that it was in a neutral (takeoff) position, not a full nose up position as would be expected if the trim system had malfunctioned. The elevator moved freely through its entire range of motion with no indication of jamming. There did not appear to be any impact damage to the trim mechanism or to its mounting structure. The trim motor electrical connector was found disconnected. It could not be determined whether the connector was pulled apart during the impact sequence or had been intentionally disconnected. Using a battery for power, the trim motor was tested and found to be capable of driving the trim through its full range of motion from the full nose-up to the full nose-down position. The Pilot's Operating Handbook for the airplane states that \"it is possible to easily override full trim or autopilot inputs by using normal control inputs.\"",

The flight was obtaining VFR flight following from air route traffic control center (ARTCC) when the facility lost radar and radio contact.  The airplane came to rest near the edge of an elliptical meadow, which was about 1 mile long by 1/4 mile wide, with the long axis oriented east and west.  The meadow was in mountainous terrain and surrounded by trees over 100 feet tall.  The debris path was along the eastern edge of the meadow on a magnetic bearing of 210 degrees.  Multiple large trees were observed with broken branches and major impact marks on their trunks.  The crankcase had a 3-inch diameter hole in it above cylinder number 3.  Examination of the engine found that the crankshaft fractured and separated at the rear of the number 4 cheek.  The fracture was at the forward radius of the number 2 main bearing journal.  Smeared metal was on the fracture surfaces.  A metallurgical examination determined that a large portion of the fracture surface exhibited smooth crack arrest markings typical of fatigue propagation.  Failure of the crankshaft was caused by a fatigue crack in the cheek between the number 3 rod journal and the number 2 main bearing journal.  The fracture of the crankshaft caused the additional damage to the engine, including the separation of the numbers 3 and 4 connecting rods from their respective journals, and would have led to a complete loss of engine power.  The origin of the fatigue fracture was in the transition between the number 2 main bearing journal surface and the forward fillet radius, approximately 0.036 inches below the surface of the journal.  No metallurgical anomalies or manufacturing process errors were found to explain the fatigue initiation.  This failure is very similar to a number of others investigated by the Safety Board's Materials Laboratory in the past, with a fatigue crack initiating just below the hardened case layer.  As with many of those previous events, there were no material or microstructural defects that could be identified as the root cause of the fatigue initiation.  The crankshaft met design material specifications.",

The private pilot/owner and two passengers sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight that departed Triple Tree Aerodrome (SC00), Woodruff, South Carolina, about 0930. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. In a written statement, the pilot said the airplane had a 60-gallon fuel capacity, and he departed with approximately 26 gallons of fuel for the 35-minute flight to UZA. He then planned to fill the airplane with fuel for a flight back to Collegedale, Tennessee.

The transmission was not acknowledged, and the Piper pilot flew southwest bound and never reported the Cessna in sight.  When both aircraft were on a 3-mile final approach to parallel runways, the controller, with both aircraft in sight, issued a traffic advisory to the Cessna regarding the Piper behind them, but did not issue a traffic advisory to the Piper regarding the Cessna in front of them.  The two aircraft collided in flight, 1.5 miles east of the airport.  The Piper, with a student pilot in the left seat and a flight instructor in the right seat, overtook the high wing aircraft from above, behind and to the right.  The lower fuselage of the Piper contacted the upper fuselage and propeller of the high wing aircraft.  The Cessna's propeller severed the primary control cables of the Piper and it descended out of control and crashed.  The Cessna made a off-airport forced landing and collided with a berm during the ground roll. ",

He inadvertently taxied onto a roadway and that the setting sun, which was in his eyes, caused him not to see a warning sign on the right side of the roadway; the airplane's right wing then struck the sign. The pilot had exited the runway's parallel taxiway at midfield onto an airplane parking and fueling area. He taxied to a road transiting the parking area, and turned northwest on the road. The road narrowed at the boundary of the parking area and the pilot passed a \"No Taxi\" sign located on the left side of the road. The route from the runway to parking is along nonmovement areas, and progressive taxi instructions were thus not available. An interactive airport web site with detailed parking information and taxi diagrams was available on the internet. The appropriate route was to proceed west on the parallel taxiway to the taxilane which crosses the road taken by the pilot. The sign the airplane hit had flashing amber lights and warned of the taxilane crossing.

Three months after the accident, the pilot telephoned the NTSB investigator-in-charge and indicated that he had placed the airplane in a tight step-turn during the takeoff attempt, and it was during the step-turn that he heard  a loud \"pop\" and felt the airplane shudder.  He said he immediately reduced the engine power to idle, and due to the airplane being in a tight turn at the time, he lost directional control and the airplane collided with the shore.

The helicopter departed for a 22-nautical mile training flight with 10 gallons of fuel remaining in the 28-gallon fuel tank.  While en route, both the certified flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot noted that an unusually high application of carburetor heat was required to keep the inlet temperature needle within the normal range.  With the intention of entering the traffic pattern at the destination airport, the student pilot initiated a descent and maneuvered the helicopter in a right turn.  With the helicopter configured in the right turn, about 500 feet above ground level (agl), the engine experienced a momentary power interruption and subsequently stopped.  The student pilot executed an autorotation and the helicopter touched down in a crop field.  The right skid dug into the soft muddy field, resulting in the helicopter rotating around the skid and coming to rest on its right side.  The fuel tank contained about 5 gallons of fuel just prior to the accident.  Due to the orientation of the fuel outlet port inside the fuel tank, the helicopter is susceptible to unporting with low quantities of fuel present during maneuvers.  With the outlet located on the left side of the tank, when a helicopter is in a right turn with minimal fuel onboard, the outlet can intake air resulting in fuel starvation to the engine.  According to a standard reference icing probability chart, the atmospheric conditions present at the time of the accident were in the range considered favorable for carburetor ice formation.",

The pilot reported that following the loss of elevator trim authority the airplane was extremely difficult to control and the elevator control forces were extremely high.  The pilot continued to maneuver the airplane, but eventually ditched it into a nearby marine cove.  The runaway trim condition was not immediately recognized by the pilot and he stated that, by that point in the event sequence, the control forces were so great that he had little time to troubleshoot the system and elected to continue on his established heading and ditch the airplane.  Pulling the circuit breaker, which is called for by the checklist in the event of a trim runaway, would have arrested the trim movement.   Post accident examination and functional testing of the airplane's electric pitch trim printed circuit board (PCB) showed a repeatable fault in the operation of the PCB's K6 relay, resulting in the relay contacts remaining closed.  This condition would be representative of the autopilot pitch trim remaining engaged, providing an electrical current to drive continuous nose-down trim to the elevator trim motor.  Examination of the airplane's maintenance records showed that the PCB was removed and replaced in conjunction with the phase inspection prior to the accident.  Further examination of the airplane's maintenance records revealed that the replacement PCB was originally installed in an airplane that experienced an \"electric trim runaway on the ground.\"  Following the trim runaway, the PCB was removed and shipped to the manufacturer.  After receiving the PCB the manufacturer tested the board and no discrepancies were noted.  The unit was subsequently approved for return to service and later installed on the accident airplane.  The investigation revealed a single-point failure of trim runaway (failed K6 relay) and a latent system design anomaly in the autopilot/trim disconnect switch on the airplane's pitch trim PCB.  This design prohibited the disengagement of the electric trim motor during autopilot operation.  As a result of the investigation, the FAA issued three airworthiness directives (AD 2003-21-07, AD 2003-23-20, and AD 2004-14-20), and the pitch trim printed circuit board was redesigned and evaluated for compliance with safety requirements via system safety assessment  ",

The pilot reported to ATC that he was \"having a little bit of a problem\" and may need to return to FRG. The pilot then reported that he would have to \"take it down\u2026\" The controller provided the relative locations of LaGuardia and JFK Airports, and stated that Westchester Airport was to the north and FRG was to the southeast. The pilot responded that FRG was the closest airport to his location. The pilot then indicated that he may not make FRG. The controller then provided information on \"Bethpage strip\" and informed the pilot that the airport was closed; however, there was a runway there. The airplane was then observed tracking toward the Bethpage area while descending. The next several transmissions between the controller and pilot revealed that the pilot was unable to see the runway while the controller continued to provide heading and distance to the Bethpage runway. Radar and radio contact were eventually lost and emergency responders were notified of the accident.The passenger was interviewed after the accident. He reported that the flight was in cruise when he heard a loud \"pop\" sound, with a flicker of light from the engine area, followed by an \"oil smell.\" The engine then began to \"sputter\" and lose power.

While taxiing, the captain of the Airbus realized that the Embraer, which was stopped on the perpendicular taxiway, would be in close proximity on his right side.  After crossing the active runway, and while approaching the EMB-170, both the captain and first officer became concerned as to whether the tail of their A319 had actually passed inside the hold short line for the active runway they just crossed.  As the A319 approached the EMB-170 the captain slowed his airplane to approximately 2 knots, and taxied well to the left of the centerline.  The captain of the A319 then lost sight of the EMB-170 and asked the first officer to \"confirm clear of the Embraer.\"  The first officer gave a verbal response along with a \"thumbs up.\"  Approximately 2 seconds later the captain asked the first officer \"confirm still clear?\" and the first officer responded \"clear but close.\"  Moments later as the captain was getting ready to ask the first officer for confirmation for a third time, the right wingtip of their airplane made contact with the EMB-170 airplane's right elevator.

The airplane was making a climbing right turn to re-enter the field when the nose dropped and, subsequently, the airplane entered a steep descent and impacted the ground.  According to data from a SATLOC GPS, most of the turns made during the flight had a diameter of 1,000 feet.  The data ended with the airplane completing 230 degrees of a right turn with a diameter of 660 feet. Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted the ground in a near vertical attitude.  Partial flight control continuity was established for the aileron and elevators, and continuity was established for the rudder.  The engine and propeller exhibited evidence of producing power at the time of impact. ",

He reported performing a preflight inspection and an engine run-up prior to departure, and that during the takeoff roll and initial climb, the airplane performed normally. The pilot began to initiate a slow left turn once the airplane had reached an altitude of 200 feet. During the turn the airplane rolled to the left, and the nose pitched down. The pilot reported attempting to correct the deviation with the input of right rudder. The airplane collided with terrain and an airport perimeter fence. During a subsequent telephone interview, the pilot stated that he applied too much left rudder input during the left turn, and the [left] wing \"slipped away.\" A postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no preimpact malfunctions, nor did the pilot report any.",

The pilot entered the traffic pattern for the runway in turbulent conditions.  He slowed the airplane and entered downwind.  After turning from base to final, the airplane touched down and skidded to a stop at the left side of the runway.  The pilot thought he had moved the gear handle to the down position; however, it was found in the up position after the accident.  He said he was not sure if he simply forgot to lower the gear or accidentally bumped the handle to the up position in the turbulence.  No mechanical malfunctions were noted with the airplane.",
