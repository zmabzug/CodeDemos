The Cessna 208B and the Cessna 207 were both traveling in an easterly direction. According to the Cessna 207 pilot, the airplanes departed from two neighboring remote Alaskan villages about the same time, and both airplanes were flying along similar flight routes. While en route, the Cessna 207 pilot talked with the Cessna 208B pilot on a prearranged, discreet radio frequency, and the two agreed to meet up in flight for the return to their home airport. The Cessna 207 pilot said that the pilot of the Cessna 208B flew his airplane along the left side of her airplane while she was in level cruise flight at 1,200 feet mean sea level and that they continued to talk via the radio. Then, unexpectedly and unannounced, the pilot of the Cessna 208B maneuvered his airplane above and over the top of her airplane. She said that she immediately told the Cessna 208B pilot that she could not see him and that she was concerned about where he was. She said that the Cessna 208B pilot then said, in part: \"Whatever you do, don't pitch up.\" The next thing she recalled was seeing the wings and cockpit of the descending Cessna 208B pass by the right side of her airplane, which was instantly followed by an impact with her airplane's right wing. She said that after the collision, the Cessna 208B passed underneath her airplane from right-to-left before beginning a gradual descent that steepened as the airplane continued to the left. It then entered a steep, vertical, nose-down descent before colliding with the tundra-covered terrain below followed by a postcrash fire. Unable to maintain level cruise flight, the Cessna 207 pilot selected an area of rolling, tundra-covered terrain as a forced landing site. An examination of both airplanes revealed impact signatures consistent with the Cessna 208B's vertical stabilizer impacting the Cessna 207's right wing. A portion of crushed and distorted wreckage, identified as part of the Cessna 208B's vertical stabilizer assembly, was found embedded in the Cessna 207's right wing.

The manager saw the pilot pour 3 quarts of oil into the oil tank and put the additional 3 quarts of oil in the back of the aircraft cockpit.

The CFI reported that the aircraft was established in cruise flight on an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan when it encountered light rime icing.  He initially attempted to climb to avoid the icing area, however, aircraft performance had deteriorated significantly climbing through 7,400 feet mean sea level (msl).  He then elected to descend.  He reported that the flight \"broke out of [the] clouds at 4,700 [feet] msl and leved off at 4,000 [feet msl]\".  He estimated that 1/4 inch of ice had accumulated on the wing leading edges at that point.  The pilot decided to divert to an intermediate airport in order to remove the ice from the aircraft and evaluate the weather conditions.  The flight was subsequently cleared for a visual approach.  The CFI reported that after the approach, the flight was not in a position to land and he elected to execute a missed approach.  He stated:  \"I applied full power and raised the nose to start a climb.  I then banked the aircraft to the left to circle back around for landing.  At this point the aircraft bucked and shook as if it was stalling.  I lowered the nose to stop the stall and noticed the ground coming up quickly.  I tried to slow the descent but the aircraft continued descending and impacted the ground.\"  Airport personnel reported that 5/16 - 3/8 inch of ice accumulation was observed on all wing and stabilizer leading edges.  An AIRMET for icing conditions was in effect at the time of the accident.  Pilot reports for light rime and moderate mixed icing were on file prior to the flight's departure.  Federal Aviation Administration publications note that ice accretion on an aircraft's wing can \"significantly alter the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing\" and that a \"stall may occur with little or none of the usual cues in advance.\"  The Cessna model 172R information manual states that flight into known icing conditions is prohibited.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor's inadequate in-flight planning/decision which resulted in ice accretion on the airframe, and his failure to maintain adequate airspeed resulting in a stall.  Contributing factors were the ice contamination, the aircraft's low altitude and the flight instructor's flight into known icing conditions in an aircraft not equipped with deice/anti-icing equipment."

The airline transport pilot and one passenger sustained serious injuries; the remaining two passengers were not injured. The helicopter sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence. The local flight departed from a helispot at Loon Lake, California, about 1255, with a planned destination of Buck Island Lake. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a company flight plan had been filed.The helicopter was being utilized for transportation of both supplies and passengers (event organizers) for the Jeep and Jeepers Jamboree off-road events. The events took place along the Rubicon Trail during two adjoining weekends. The helicopter, pilot, and a fuel truck were provided by Heli-Flite, and were all utilized at the discretion of the event organizers. The helicopter and pilot had flown for the event the weekend prior. During that period multiple uneventful missions were completed transporting crew, as well as equipment and supplies under external load utilizing the helicopter's long-line.On the morning of the accident the pilot departed from the helicopter's temporary base in Placerville, California, and performed multiple crew repositioning flights to the Buck Island Lake area, as well transporting external loads from Loon Lake to Rubicon Springs. For the accident flight he departed from Loon Lake with three passengers on board, with the intention of picking up a fourth at Buck Island Lake. The inbound flight lasted about 3 minutes and was uneventful. The passenger being picked up observed the helicopter approach the landing spot over the lake from the south. The helicopter landed, and the passenger boarded. Once secure he gave the pilot the signal to depart, and the helicopter lifted into a hover about 20-30 feet off the ground. The passengers all recounted similar observations, stating that having attained a hover, the helicopter began a 180-degree turn to the south, and then proceeded to move forward. Rather than climb, the helicopter descended while still maintaining forward movement, crashing into trees and rocks south of the takeoff point.The accident site was located on the northwest shore of the lake, which was located within the confines of the Eldorado National Forest, 8 miles southwest of Tahoma. The primary wreckage consisted of the fuselage and tailboom, and was located on the lakeshore adjacent to the intersection of two concrete dam walls, at an elevation of 6,445 feet. Fragments of the main rotor blades were strewn around the site and into the adjoining lake. The farthest located component was a main rotor blade tip, which came to rest about 350 feet northeast. The remaining two blade tips were located in the immediate vicinity of the fuselage. All primary airframe components were accounted for at the accident site.The takeoff point was located on a flat rock slab in between the two dam walls. The main wreckage was located about 170 feet south, and 10 feet below the takeoff point.

Following the structural failure of the stabilizers and elevators, the airplane dove into the ground.  FAA inspectors monitoring air race activities responded to the accident site and interviewed witnesses.  The accident occurred about halfway through the sport class race.  As the airplane was rounding pylon No. 1, the horizontal stabilizers and elevators began flexing (one witness said the airplane began a shallow porpoise just before the crash) and then bent down.  The airplane then dove into the ground.  On-site assessment of the wreckage disclosed that the horizontal stabilizers and elevators remained attached to the empennage; however, they were bent down at an acute angle at a point about 2 feet outboard from the root on each side.  The airplane was extensively fragmented and control system continuity could not be established on scene.  The airspeed indicator was recovered in the debris; the needle was trapped between the fractured glass and the instrument face at the 300-knot/red line.  Official timers for the Reno Air Races reported to FAA inspectors that based on time over the measured course distance, the airplane was doing 330 knots just before the accident.  The present owner of the design rights for this experimental kit-built all metal airplane said that the airplane was designed by professional aircraft design engineers who worked for a major general aviation manufacturer.  The airplane was designed with a gross weight design maneuvering speed (Va) of 156 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).  Never exceed speed (Vne) is 300 KIAS, and the maximum structural cruising speed (Vno) is 265 KIAS.  During the design and prototype development, a ground vibration test (GVT) survey was performed, with no excitable nodes found within the airplane's anticipated envelope.  The flight test program validated that flutter could not be excited up to Vne.  The design owner said that during the developmental flight test work with the prototype, it was flown one time without an artificial force feel limiting device in the elevator control circuit.  The stick force per g without the force feel/limiters is less than a pound of control force.  During that flight the test pilots encountered a very severe pilot induced oscillation (PIO).  A spring assembly was devised for the elevator control circuit to impart a 10-pound per g force feel feed back in the elevator controls to prevent PIO.  Examination of the wreckage disclosed that the spring in the elevator force feel/limiter assembly was the wrong size and had only 30 percent of the required tension.  Other discrepancies were noted concerning the bushings and bearings in the elevator attachments and the construction workmanship.",
            "probable_cause": "the overload failure of the horizontal stabilizers and elevators due to a pilot induced oscillation at a speed at or above Vne, which exceeded the design stress limits of the structure.  Also causal was the intentional alteration by an unknown person or persons of the elevator down spring assembly, which likely reduced the stick force per G from a nominal 10 pounds to less than 1, and led to the pilot induced oscillation.  An additional cause was the pilot's decision to operate the aircraft at, above, or near never exceed speed."

About two minutes after entering IMC, the aircraft broke out of the clouds with about one-half inch of clear ice on its exterior.

The private pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight originated from Bloomsburg Municipal Airport (N13), Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania.According to the pilot, prior to his departure he checked the weather and determined that the flight would be in visual meteorological conditions. Prior to landing he observed the windsock and a flag, mounted at the top of a rollercoaster, at a nearby amusement park. Both indicated that the wind was \"light\" and favoring the use of runway 31. During the landing attempt, he stated that \"the runway was hot\" and it felt as though the \"braking had little effect,\" he released the brakes and then applied braking again. However, he felt that there may not have been enough remaining runway to safely stop and applied \"full power\" to begin a go-around maneuver.

After landing, the pilot purchased fuel and updated the flight plan. The pilot stated to the flight service station briefer that he was aware of the area AIRMETs (airmen\u2019s meteorological information) for mountain obscuration and turbulence that were active for the area of intended flight. The weather conditions at the destination 30 minutes prior to the accident were calm wind; 5 miles visibility; few clouds at 700 feet, broken clouds at 4,400 feet, and overcast at 5,000 feet. The pilot departed for the destination, which was located 38 miles east and where the airplane was based. Although the pilot had updated his flight plan before they departed, the pilot never activated the flight plan once airborne. The route between the departure airport and destination airport consisted of flight over mountainous terrain with terrain elevations between 1,000 and 1,750 feet mean sea level (msl). Radar and global positioning system data showed that the airplane proceeded east at an altitude of around 2,800 feet msl and followed a highway. Twenty minutes after takeoff and 14 miles northwest of the destination, the airplane changed to southeasterly flight path towards the destination. The airplane started a very gradual descent and, after about 2 minutes, impacted trees at 1,500-feet msl while in level flight; the airplane was about 9 miles northwest of the destination. Weather analysis indicated that conditions at the accident site leading up to the time of the accident were low clouds at 700 feet above ground level (agl) with ceilings at 4,000 feet. Surface conditions were near saturation, indicative of precipitation reaching the ground and/or reduced visibilities. Weather radar imagery indicated the accident airplane was below an area of light precipitation during the final portion of flight. Conditions between 300 feet agl and 1,500 feet were highly favorable for cloud sustainment and/or development. A much deeper cloudy region dominated altitudes above 4,000 feet, and the freezing level was about 5,000 feet.

He recalled observing light frost on the outboard wing and tip tank during the approach. The stick shaker activated on short final, and the airplane impacted left of the runway centerline before it ultimately departed the right side of the runway pavement and crossed a slight rise before coming to rest in the grass. The cockpit voice recorder transcript indicated that the pilots were operating in icing conditions without the wing anti-ice system activated for about 4 1/2 minutes prior to activation of the stick shaker. A postaccident examination of the airplane did not reveal any anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure of the flight control system or a loss of anti-ice system functionality. A performance study determined that the airplane\u2019s airspeed during the final 30 seconds of the flight was about 114 knots and that the angle of attack ultimately met the stick shaker threshold. The expected stall speed for the airplane was about 93 knots. The airplane flight manual stated that anti-ice systems should be turned on prior to operation in icing conditions during normal operations. The manual warned that even small accumulations of ice on the wing leading edge can cause an aerodynamic stall prior to activation of the stick shaker and/or stick pusher.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s decision to conduct an instrument approach in icing conditions without the anti-ice system activated, contrary to the airplane flight manual guidance, which resulted in an inadvertent aerodynamic stall due to an in-flight accumulation of airframe icing."

The certified commercial pilot and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal cross-country flight, which was being operated in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed and active. The flight departed Gillespie Field (SEE), San Diego, California, at 1000, with SQL as the planned destination.According to a report submitted to the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, the pilot reported that after touching down on both main landing gear, the nose wheel was lowered, followed by the power lever retarded aft into the BETA position to slow the airplane. The pilot stated that this was followed by an immediate shimmy, which quickly became severe. The control stick was then pulled back to alleviate pressure on the nose gear, but the nose gear collapsed about 2 to 3 seconds later. The airplane then skidded for about 1,000 feet on the runway surface before it veered to the right onto the grass adjacent to the runway. The aircraft then slid for about another 70 feet, after which it came to rest upright. An examination of the airplane failed to reveal any structural damage as a result of the gear collapse.The airplane was recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

Another pilot who was airborne at 5,500 feet msl (mean sea level) at the time of the accident said that he had radio communications with the pilot of the accident airplane.  The accident pilot stated that he could not get the engine to restart, that he had tried everything, and he was going down.  The pilot then observed the accident airplane in a controlled descent into an area populated by large trees.  A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the lever arm of the engine-driven fuel pump had failed in fatigue.  Testing of the electric fuel boost pump demonstrated that it was capable of delivering fuel to the engine; however, the Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge states that, in regard to fuel-injected engines, it is difficult to restart a hot engine or an engine that quits because of fuel starvation.  The airplane logbooks documented that 44 days earlier the engine-driven fuel pump had been removed and replaced twice.  After the first installation the engine would not run.  The fuel pump was installed a second time, which resulted in successful engine operation. The engine ran for 16.1-hours before the fuel pump lever arm failed from a fatigue crack in the pivot area of the arm, causing the engine to lose power from fuel starvation.  It is possible to incorrectly install this type of fuel pump.  When the engine's fuel pump push rod is in the extended position it can interfere with the placement of the fuel pump lever arm during the installation, which results in it being obstructed or jammed against the engine case, possibly creating a crack in the pivot area of the lever arm. In this situation the engine usually does not run because the pump lever arm and engine push rod are not aligned correctly and fuel is not being pumped. The crack may not be visually detectable because the location is obscured by the pump case.",
            "probable_cause": "The improper installation of the fuel pump, leading to a fatigue failure of the pump's lever arm and subsequent loss of engine power. Contributing to the accident was the lack of suitable terrain for a forced landing."

The last transmission received from the pilot was about 1 minute 40 seconds after takeoff when the pilot acknowledged receipt of a clearance. Radar data shows the airplane climbing on course to an altitude of 8,100 feet mean sea level (msl).  About 3 minutes 23 seconds after takeoff, the airplane began to descend and entered a right turn. The last radar return was recorded about 5 minutes after takeoff and placed the airplane at 3,300 feet msl about 1/4-mile east of the accident site. A witness reported seeing the airplane emerge from an overcast cloud layer in a near vertical attitude traveling at a high rate of speed. The airplane impacted in the backyard of a residence. Review of weather data shows that the airplane was probably in and out of clouds after departure until it passed through about 4,000 feet msl.

Within 1 minute, the pilot saw that the engine had completely lost oil pressure, so he shut down the engine and advised an air traffic controller of the situation. He then asked for and received vectors to the nearest airport, but, during the descent, he recognized that the airplane would be unable to reach the airport. Shortly thereafter, he advised the controller that he would deploy the airplane\u2019s ballistic parachute when the airplane was over suitable terrain. After the pilot deployed the parachute, the airplane impacted a field and came to rest upright. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that a nipple in the flexible oil line used to provide engine oil to an aftermarket engine supercharger had failed due to fatigue, which resulted in a complete loss of engine oil. The fatigue crack had multiple initiation sites that were not the result of any manufacturing or material defects. Evidence indicates that a washer was present on the nipple threads between the nipple and the oil nozzle at one time. The washer initially prevented proper thread engagement and sealing of the joint between the nipple and the nozzle. To seal the joint, the nipple was then overtorqued, which resulted in the fatigue crack initiation. Engine vibration caused the flexible oil line to impose cyclic loads on the nipple, which, over time, failed due to fatigue. Although the supercharger installation was approved under a Federal Aviation Administration supplemental type certificate (STC), the installation was not in accordance with the STC installation and maintenance instructions or standard maintenance practices. Although review of the supercharger STC installation and maintenance instructions revealed that they did not contain detailed information for installing the oil nozzle or nipple, the lack of this information did not appear to directly contribute to the improper installation of the supercharger on the accident airplane.

The Canadian certificated pilot, the sole occupant, succumbed to his injuries on February 24, 2015. The airplane was destroyed during the attempted emergency landing after it struck a railroad track. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the instrument flight rules (IFR) flight that originated shortly before the accident. The flight was destined for the Stockton Metropolitan Airport (SCK) Stockton, California. A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector responded to the accident site and identified two different groups of witnesses. The first set of witnesses observed the airplane with the engine sputtering. They observed the left wing drop and the nose pitch up. The right wing then dropped, and the witnesses lost sight of the airplane as it passed behind a building. The second set of witnesses reported that the right wing struck a railroad track at the top of a hill and subsequently traveled down an embankment. The witnesses reported that the airplane slid across a road and came to rest inverted adjacent to the bottom of a railroad bridge. Responding investigators stated that the majority of the airplane came to rest at the accident site, with additional wreckage strewn throughout the debris path. Both of the wings had separated from the airplane fuselage; however, they remained near the main wreckage. The investigators stated that the fuel tanks ruptured during the accident sequence, and there was a strong smell of Jet fuel present.

The captain said they entered clouds and the flight was smooth for about 10 minutes when they noticed a very small red return (thunderstorm cell)on the radar about 5 miles in front of them. The crew did not have enough time to take evasive action and they penetrated the cell, encountering moderate rain with a strong updraft followed by one instance of a severe downdraft. The autopilot disengaged and the captain assumed control of the airplane. Shortly after, the flight attendant called on the interphone and said that she was assisting an elderly passenger in the lavatory when the upset occurred and they were both seriously injured. The captain immediately declared an emergency and landed without further incident. Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR) imagery identified a discrete cell of strong reflectivity values coincident with the airplane's position at the time of the turbulence event. A review of recorded weather data from two separate air traffic control centers handling the flight showed that moderate to extreme intensity precipitation existed ahead of the airplane for an extended period. However, the controllers did not recall seeing any displayed precipitation in the accident location, although they did recall seeing precipitation in other locations around the area. Review of display settings in use by the controllers showed no reason that the weather would not have been displayed, and there was no indication of a system malfunction.

In response, the instructor initiated an autorotation by lowering the collective, and the engine immediately lost power. The helicopter touched down and then rocked forward due to soft and downward-sloping terrain. The instructor applied slight aft cyclic to prevent the main rotor blades from contacting the ground; however, the main rotor blades struck and severed the tail boom. The engine was functionally tested, and it operated normally. However, one of the magnets used to provide rotor rpm indications was missing from the rotating transmission yoke and was found affixed to a bolt just aft of the yoke. It likely had become loose in flight, and its movement was the bang heard by the pilots. Scarring was found on one of the sensors opposite the magnet, indicating that the magnet had contacted the sensor. The separation of the magnet caused the rotor rpm indication to drop and the low rotor rpm warning horn and light to activate. Due to the control linkage between the collective and the throttle, when the instructor lowered the collective, the throttle closed rapidly. According to Robinson Helicopters, rapid throttle changes can result in a fuel-air ratio becoming too rich or too lean to sustain engine operation and result in an engine failure. ",

That was when he noticed that the sound of the engine had changed and saw that the pilot was struggling to control the airplane.  The airplane went through a series of three quick rolls and the wing dipped down.  The airplane entered a counterclockwise spin.  The pilot told the right seat passenger to pull the emergency parachute handle, so he pulled the throttle back to idle, and then pulled the parachute handle.  The airplane impacted a water retention pond about 4 seconds later.  Witnesses observed the airplane descending through the clouds with a partially deployed parachute.  The inspection of the engine and airframe revealed no pre-existing anomalies.  The engine data obtained from the Multi-Function Display indicated the engine was operating at full power for the entire flight.

At the time of the accident, the airplane was being cooled by an external diesel powered air conditioning cart that pressurizes the cabin when the airplane doors are closed.  The external air conditioning cart was required because the auxiliary power unit  was inoperative.  The captain said that he briefed the flight attendant, before boarding the airplane and again in the cockpit, to keep one door open.  The captain did not specify that the reason the flight attendant needed to keep a door open was because the air conditioning cart pressurized the cabin if all the doors were closed.

Using a group of F/A-18 pilots in a F/A-18 simulator, the lowest altitude at the top of the reverse one-half Cuban eight required to successfully complete the maneuver was 2,500 feet agl.

After the medical personnel and patient were unloaded, the \"thumbs up\" was given to the pilot verifying the helicopter's doors were secure and all equipment had been secured.  The pilot then completed the before takeoff checklist.  The pilot \"pulled\" the collective pitch lever, the helicopter became airborne, and began to \"back up.\"  He then discovered that he had forgotten to disengage the cyclic control lock mechanism after items, which had been carried on the front left seat, had been removed during the \"hot offload.\"  Fearing that the rearward movement of the helicopter may have taken him over the edge of the helipad, the pilot \"immediately\" lowered collective pitch, resulting in a hard landing.  Examination of the incident aircraft's cyclic stick locking mechanism revealed that the locking mechanism installed on the helicopter was non-contrasting, and dark gray in color.  Only three different cyclic stick locking mechanism color schemes had been produced by the manufacturer (light gray, black, or light gray with a yellow tip) and prior to the accident, a service bulletin had been issued,  recommending that a yellow area be painted on the end of the older locking mechanisms to provide contrast.  All aircraft produced subsequent to the service bulletin came equipped with a light gray and yellow cyclic stick locking mechanism.  The cyclic stick locking mechanism was secured by means of a locking pin mounted on the underside of the instrument panel. In the event of an emergency, due to it not having been unlocked by the pilot, the locking pin was designed to be \"sheared through\" by a \"jerky movement\" of the cyclic stick, which would then allow it to move freely.  The manufacturer evaluated the breakout force to be approximately 26.98 pounds of force at the stick grip.  During a post incident interview, the pilot advised that he was unable to disconnect the cyclic stick locking mechanism even though he attempted to \"jerk the stick.\"  During an examination of the incident helicopter, breakout force was measured at approximately 44 pounds during one test and 42 pounds during another.  Review of the operator developed checklist for the helicopter revealed that there was no reference to use of the cyclic stick locking mechanism, or inclusion of requirement to verify that the flight controls were free and correct.  Additionally, the company operations manual did not address use of the cyclic stick locking mechanism during hot loading or unloading of passengers. ",

The flight departed and completed one circuit around the traffic pattern and then initiated a second circuit.  While on the downwind leg of the second circuit, witnesses observed the airplane enter a steep nose down attitude as it was turning onto the base leg followed by the sound of an impact.  Radar data revealed that that the airplane's ground speed had decreased throughout the maneuver and was near stall speed at the time the accident occurred. The commercial pilot had a history of hip pain treated with nortriptyline (a prescription antidepressant also used for pain control), and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder treated with fluoxetine (a prescription antidepressant also used for other psychiatric conditions) and trazodone (a prescription antidepressant also used for insomnia).  Toxicology findings were consistent with the ongoing use of all three drugs.  Nortriptyline has adverse cognitive and performance effects, particularly with higher blood levels, and fluoxetine may interfere with its metabolism, potentially raising the blood level of nortriptyline.  It is possible that the pilot was impaired or distracted by his hip pain, or impaired by nortriptyline.  The private pilot occasionally used diphenhydramine (an over-the-counter sedating antihistamine) for allergy symptoms, and toxicology findings were consistent with recent ingestion of the drug.

The pilot was unable to restart the engine, and he subsequently ditched the airplane in a lake. A postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any mechanical anomalies that would have prevented normal operation. No fuel was found in the fuel system during the postaccident examination; however, the airplane had been submerged for nearly 1 week before it was recovered from the lake.Postaccident performance calculations indicated that it is likely that the engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion during the accident flight. Although the pilot reported that he had completed preflight planning calculations (the actual paperwork was lost during the accident), the investigation determined that the wind aloft values that the pilot likely used in his preflight planning calculations were significantly different from the actual wind aloft values. As a result, the airplane's actual ground speed was significantly less than what the pilot would have anticipated. The pilot also reported that he completed the accident flight at less than 65-percent engine power, which would have increased the length of the flight and the amount of fuel used during it when compared to higher engine power settings; the available cruise performance charts lacked true airspeed and engine speed data for operating below 65-percent engine power. Therefore, the pilot could not have estimated the total flight time and fuel required for the accident flight with a high level of accuracy. Additionally, the pilot reported that the mixture control cable had fractured during a previous flight and, to continue his cross-country trip, he safety-wired the carburetor mixture control arm in the full-rich position. As a result, the pilot was unable to properly lean the fuel mixture during the accident flight; however, it is unknown to what extent the pilot planned for this condition. Further, the pilot made an unplanned stop at an airport located along his planned route of flight. The additional fuel consumed during this unplanned stop (taxi, engine run-up, takeoff, and climb to cruise altitude) would have further reduced the amount of fuel available to complete the accident flight.",

After the aircraft touched down, the pilot became uncomfortable with the downwind landing, and elected to make a go-around. He applied power two separate times during the attempted go-around, but both times the engine coughed and sputtered and would not accelerate. The pilot therefore decided to abort the go-around, and attempted to stop the aircraft in the remaining runway. According to the pilot, as the aircraft was slowing, the tailwind picked up the aft end of the aircraft and caused it to nose over. In a post- accident telephone interview, the pilot said that he had failed to readjust the engine fuel mixture from its more-lean cruise setting prior to landing.

About the time the airplane departed, weather conditions worsened with freezing fog, heavy snow fall, and reduced visibility. However, at that time, neither a significant meteorological information (SIGMET) nor a center weather advisory warning of severe icing conditions had been issued. After departure, an air traffic controller cleared the airplane to climb to 9,000 ft mean sea level (msl). When the airplane was about 7,000 ft msl and still climbing, the pilot asked the controller if there were any reports regarding the cloud tops, and the controller responded that there were not. Less than a minute later, radar data showed the airplane descending, and the pilot issued a \u201cmayday\u201d call. Radio and radar contact were then lost. The wreckage was found about 11 miles northeast of the airport. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.Flight crewmembers of two flights inbound to the airport around the time of the accident reported that they encountered freezing rain and severe mixed icing; these conditions were beyond the airplane\u2019s icing certification standards and could have caused increased weight, degraded performance, and unpredictable aerodynamic characteristics. Federal Aviation Administration guidance warns that, when severe icing conditions are encountered, the pilot shall immediately request priority handling to facilitate a route or an altitude change to exit the icing conditions. Based on the weather information, it is likely that the airplane encountered severe icing conditions about the time of the accident, which resulted in structural icing that exceeded the airplane\u2019s capabilities and resulted in a loss of control. Based on the wreckage distribution, which was consistent with a high-speed impact, and the low visibility present at the time of the accident, it is likely that, after the loss of airplane control, the pilot experienced spatial disorientation; however, there was insufficient evidence to determine the role that spatial disorientation might have played in the accident.\u000b",

He then heard the engine \"skip,\" which made him look up and observe the airplane in a steep left turn with a nose high attitude.  At the same time he heard the engine noise decrease \"like the throttle was pulled to idle.\"  When the airplane was about parallel with the \"old runway 28,\" the witness observed the tail swing aggressively to the right, and at the same time, he heard the engine rev-up.  The airplane then stalled, and began to spiral downward counter-clockwise, before impacting the asphalt and bursting into flames.  Several other witnesses had observed the airplane flying 30 minutes prior to the accident.  The local training flight was the airplane's first flight since the annual inspection was performed 2 months prior to the accident.  Inspection of the carburetor revealed contaminated residual fuel and contamination of the fuel screen.  Examination of the fuel sample and the fuel screen revealed that the fuel sample contained water, copper sediments, and varnish.  The fuel sample was consistent with \"old fuel.\"  Residue observed on the fuel screen was consistent with grease.  Review of maintenance records revealed that the airplane's most recent annual inspection was performed on April 1, 2003.  The work accomplished during the annual inspection included the draining of the fuel sumps, and inspection of the fuel screen.  The maintenance records also contained a checklist for a 100 hour inspection, dated March 31, 2003, and a discrepancy sheet log.  Included in the checklist was, \"Drain carburetor float bowl - resafety plug... Remove fuel inlet screen from carb or injection throttle body, clean, reinstall and safety.\"  The checklist items were initialed by a mechanic, and additionally by an inspector.  Included in the discrepancy sheet log was an entry which stated, \"carb float bowl drain froze in place, fab tool to remove and removed drain plug.\"  The entry was initialed by a mechanic.

While en route and in visual flight rules conditions above the clouds, the pilot elected to divert to a nearby airport due to adverse weather conditions. The pilot received an instrument-flight-rules clearance, radar vectors, and instrument approach information from air traffic control (ATC). However, he was unable to complete the approach due to trouble receiving the localizer signal for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach. The pilot requested that he be able to continue with only glideslope information and the controller informed the pilot that his current altitude (2,700 feet mean sea level) was the minimum altitude that ATC could authorize. The pilot informed ATC that he was going to descend and ATC reported that radar contact was lost. Over the next approximately 4 minutes, the controller instructed the pilot several times to climb. The pilot did not comply with these requests and radar data indicated that the airplane circled several times about 1.5 miles east of the airport during this time period. After several requests the pilot agreed to climb and accepted vectors for another approach. Transcripts indicated that the pilot was able to successfully tune his navigation equipment for the global-positioning-system approach to the airport. While the airplane was being vectored for another approach the controller instructed the pilot to climb and the pilot responded \"I'm off,\" which was the last transmission received from the accident airplane. Radar data showed that the airplane remained airborne and maneuvered east of the airport for 36 minutes after the last radio transmission from the pilot. Witnesses on the ground reported seeing the airplane circling before it struck trees, the ground, and a residence. The last radar contact was within 0.1 miles of the accident location. Review of the pilot's flight records showed that he had accumulated about 8 hours of actual instrument flight time since he received an instrument rating about 10 months prior to the accident; however, the records do not indicate that the pilot had met the recent flight experience required by regulations to act as pilot in command in instrument flight conditions. The autopsy on the pilot revealed evidence of multiple previous and one very recent, possibly ongoing, heart attack. There were no indications that the pilot had been symptomatic with or was aware of his heart disease. The circumstances of the accident do not suggest incapacitation, and the pilot did not indicate any symptoms in discussions with air traffic controllers. It could not be determined whether distraction or impairment due to the pilot\u2019s heart disease may have played a role in this accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from trees and terrain during the instrument-flight-rules flight. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to comply with instrument flight procedures and his lack of recent instrument flight experience."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.A Mooney and a Beech collided in midair on the downwind for right traffic to runway 24.  A pilot in the Beech contacted Palomar ground control (GC) at 1247, requesting taxi from its fixed base operator (FBO) to runway 24.  The pilot of the Mooney called Palomar tower at 1255:37, reporting 10 miles north of the airport for landing.  The local controller (LC) instructed the Mooney pilot to enter right traffic for runway 24 and report downwind.  The air traffic control tower had a digital bright radar indicator tower equipment (DBRITE) radar.  The LC stated that the DBRITE location in the cab put it out of the line of sight of the majority of the LC's traffic scan, so using the DBRITE for reference required the LC to divert her attention from the traffic in the pattern and on the runway.  She observed the Mooney's identity next to its target on the DBRITE.  She put the Mooney on the arrival list, and continued working other traffic.  Radar data indicated that the Mooney's target followed the coastline from Oceanside to a point about 3 miles northwest of Palomar.  The airplane then turned eastbound and tracked toward the right downwind leg for runway 24.  At 1258:08, the LC cleared the Beech for takeoff, and the pilot acknowledged.  The Beech's first radar target appeared at 1258:39, and the airplane passed the departure end of the runway at 1259:02.  The Beech immediately turned right crosswind.  At 1259:27, the LC transmitted a traffic advisory to the Mooney, advising of the Beech on right crosswind turning to downwind.  In the same transmission, the LC also advised the Beech pilot of the Mooney traffic inbound on the 45-degree entry to downwind.  There was no response from either airplane.  According to the LC, the airplanes collided immediately after this transmission.  At 1259:36, the Mooney radar target crossed the path of the Beech target, at a mode C reported altitude of 1,300 feet mean sea level (msl), and the two targets merged.  Measurement on the plot of the radar targets determined that the convergence angle was 124 degrees.  One witness observed the Mooney, which was light brown with dark brown accents, bank to the right immediately prior to impact.  Another witness reported that both airplanes appeared to turn at the last second, but both turned the same way into each other.  Witnesses reported that the two airplanes merged, and then they saw a puff of white smoke.  A piece of wing fell from the Mooney, and the airplane immediately went into a nosedive.  The Mooney entered a rapid descent, striking the ground at 1259:43, approximately 300 yards from the estimated collision point.  The Beech, which was white with blue accents, banked left and maintained that attitude for a few seconds.  To some witnesses, the bank angle approached 90 degrees, while to others it appeared to go to an inverted position.  Then the airplane's nose down attitude became steeper until it nosed vertically into the ground.  The airplane landed about 100 yards from one witness, who did not observe any attempts at recovery.  The last radar target, received at 1259:48, showed the airplane descending through a mode C reported altitude of 500 feet.  During the period that the airplane was taxiing, the ground controller characterized the LC's workload as light to moderate, with no unusual circumstances in the traffic pattern.  There were \"a few\" clouds west of the airport that were close enough to be a factor for departures.  They could cause pilots to turn somewhat earlier than normal if necessary to maintain adequate clearance.  Evaluation of all evidence determined that the conflict was detectable both visually and on the tower radar display.  When the LC realized that they were in conflict, her actions were too late to provide the pilots with adequate time to maneuver to avoid a collision.  The local controller's loss of situational awareness contributed to the accident.  FAA order 7110.65 \"Air Traffic Control\" prescribed ATC procedures and phraseology for use by persons providing air traffic control services.  Paragraph 3-1-1 instructed controllers to provide airport traffic control service based only upon observed or known traffic and airport conditions.  A note stated that when operating in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR's), it was the responsibility of the pilot to avoid collision with other aircraft.  It also remarked that, due to the limited space around terminal locations, traffic information could aid pilots in avoiding collisions.",
            "probable_cause": "failure of the pilots of both airplanes to maintain an adequate visual lookout and to see and avoid each other.  A contributing factor was the failure of the controller to detect and resolve the conflict between the airplanes."

He stated that the rpm drop during the run-up was very high in comparison to the allowable rpm drop.  The witness stated that he saw the takeoff and, based on his experience of operating a similar model airplane, the accident airplane was not accelerating as he would expect.  He stated that the sound of the engine was smooth, but that he did not believe that it was developing full power during the takeoff.  He further stated that the airplane's acceleration was not fast enough for a normal takeoff.  The witness stated that he observed no attempt to stop or slow the airplane.  He stated that he observed the airplane rotate twice and then lifted about 3 feet off of the runway before it came back down left wing high and subsequently bounced into the air.  He stated that at this point, the airplane was now over the end of the runway.
