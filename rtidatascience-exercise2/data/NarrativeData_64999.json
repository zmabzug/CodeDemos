However, the aircraft's left propeller was not feathered, and gear and flaps were found to be fully extended at the time of impact.

The student pilot stated that after completing his preflight checklist, he waited, believing that the DHC-8 was about to take the runway for departure, but that when this did not happen he requested and received takeoff clearance for runway 30.  The tower controller did not issue any cautionary advisories for the DHC-8 activity to the student pilot with the takeoff clearance.  The student pilot reported that after starting toward the runway, \"I was more than half way past behind [sic] the Horizon plane, when they revved their engines.\"  The propeller blast from the DHC-8 forced the accident aircraft to tip to the left and forward, causing it to strike its wingtip and propeller on the taxiway surface.  The aircraft continued to be buffeted by the propeller blast of the DHC-8 for several more minutes as the DHC-8 continued to do its engine run.  The tower was subsequently unable to reach the DHC-8 on the radio.  The DHC-8 crew, a pair of Horizon Air mechanics, continued its engine run until it was approached and signaled by an airport operations vehicle dispatched to the scene by the tower.  About this time, the tower re-established radio contact with the DHC-8 and instructed the DHC-8 crew to reduce engine power.  In interviews with an FAA inspector, the Horizon Air mechanics indicated they did not know how or why they lost radio contact with the tower.  FAA Order 7110.65N, \"Air Traffic Control\", instructs controllers to  \"Issue [wake turbulence] cautionary information [to include use of the words jet blast, propwash, or rotorwash] to any aircraft [including those on the airport movement area] if in your opinion, wake turbulence may have an adverse effect on it.\"  However, Order 7110.65N further states that \"Because wake turbulence is unpredictable, the controller is not responsible for anticipating its existence or effect.\"  A review of FAA Air Traffic Bulletins found no information on jet blast/prop blast hazards.",

As a result of this investigation, the airplane manufacturer conducted an audit of the subcontractor that manufactured the landing gear legs. The audit revealed that, before the incident, the landing gear manufacturer had become aware of quality issues related to the mold closing process of the landing gear legs during manufacture and had implemented steps to reduce the recurrence of these issues. Based on the available evidence, the manufacturing defects in the composite main landing gear leg likely reduced the leg\u2019s load-carrying capacity and resulted in its eventual failure. ",

Engine disassembly and examination revealed that the turbine casing was deeply eroded by particles that had accumulated in the casing as a result of operating in dusty environments. The erosion caused a crack to develop, and non-uniform overheating of the engine led to the partial melting of the nozzle guide vanes and the rupture of the blade tips in all three turbine stages. Uncontained debris then punctured the turbine casing and shroud. According to the helicopter's maintenance records, the helicopter had operated 68 hours past a 100-hour inspection. The erosion in the engine was likely preexisting since it had been purchased second hand.

The airplane drifted over the left side of the runway.  Rather than attempting to redirect the airplane's course, the pilot applied full engine power to go around.  Seconds thereafter, as the engine power increased, the airplane impacted rising terrain and bushes.  The pilot wrote in his statement that he realized he should have initiated the go-around sooner. The pilot did not indicate having experienced any mechanical malfunction with his airplane.

As the flight (flt) neared FL250, the captain became concerned that the airplane would not level off at FL240.  He instructed the F/O to slow the rate of descent. The F/O attempted this by using the pitch thumbwheel on the A/P control panel.  The captain then took control, attempted to overpower the A/P, and pulled back on the control yoke.  With back pressure on the control yoke, he disengaged the A/P.

About 1 hour 50 minutes into the flight, an air traffic controller advised the pilot of an area of moderate-to-extreme precipitation 20 miles ahead, extending along the intended route of flight for 100 miles. Eight minutes later, the pilot contacted an air traffic controller and requested a descent from 12,000 to 10,000 ft mean sea level (msl) \u201cfor weather,\u201d but he did not receive a reply to the request, and the airplane continued on-course. After an additional 8 minutes, the pilot reattempted to contact a controller but was interrupted by another pilot, and he again received no response. The pilot attempted to contact a controller a third time and requested a turn to get out of the weather. This time a controller responded and advised the pilot to turn left, but, just as the pilot initiated the left turn, the airplane encountered an area of severe turbulence. The pilot reported that, while in the turbulence, the airplane encountered an updraft that put the airplane in a 4,000 ft per minute climb and that the airspeed reached 253 knots, which exceeded the airplane\u2019s never-exceed airspeed. The airplane then encountered a downdraft, which caused the airplane to lose 3,000 ft of altitude, and the primary flight display simultaneously \u201cwent black.\u201d When the display returned, it showed a message advising the pilot to \u201clevel the wings\u201d while the attitude and heading reference system realigned. The pilot subsequently used the standby instrumentation to control the airplane while he initiated an emergency descent. The airplane exited the turbulence and IMC about 4,000 ft msl, and, shortly thereafter, the propeller separated from the engine. The pilot subsequently performed a forced landing to a cornfield, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings.\u000b\u000bThe pilot reported that he received a weather briefing before departing on the accident flight. According to audio recordings of the briefing, the weather briefer advised the pilot of the adverse conditions along his route of flight; the pilot replied, \u201cOk, I guess we\u2019ll deal with that when we get there, if we have to go around it or stop, that\u2019s fine.\u201d An air traffic controller again advised the pilot of the severe weather conditions at least 20 miles ahead of the encounter. It is unlikely that the pilot\u2019s initial unanswered request to descend to 10,000 ft msl would have prevented the weather encounter, and the pilot\u2019s second and third unsuccessful attempts to contact the controller occurred more than 15 minutes after he was first advised of the weather conditions. The pilot was clearly made aware that severe weather conditions existed along his route of flight, but he waited until too far into the flight to try and avoid them, which ultimately led to the flight\u2019s encountering the conditions that resulted in the in-flight loss of control.\u000b\u000bThe air traffic controller complied with the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s minimum requirement for \u201cadditional services\u201d by providing the hazardous weather information to the pilot when he first checked in, but additional information by the controller would have been valuable. For example, as the flight continued tracking directly into known heavy-to-extreme precipitation that other aircraft were deviating around, the controller should have realized that the pilot was not taking action to avoid the weather and either suggested a deviation or at least updated him about the proximity of the hazardous weather that the airplane was rapidly approaching. Regardless, it was ultimately the pilot\u2019s responsibility to avoid the severe weather. \u000b\u000bThe propeller hub was found detached from the airplane due to a failure caused by reverse bending fatigue of the mounting bolts connecting the hub assembly to the engine crankshaft mounting flange. All of the bolts exhibited features consistent with fatigue cracking in a circular direction along the same direction as the wear marks on the hub case aft face. The reverse bending failure of the hub mounting bolts was indicative of a loose connection between the hub and the crankshaft. None of the airplane\u2019s documented maintenance indicated that the propeller hub was removed during the year before the accident.\u000b\u000bThe engine\u2019s fractured connecting rod exhibited a small thumbnail fatigue crack on one side. However, this small amount of fatigue likely occurred after the fatigue cracking had begun on the propeller bolts. Cracking in the propeller bolts would likely have created unbalanced loading in all of the connected components, including the crankshaft and connecting rod. Once the propeller separated from the crankshaft, the crankshaft absorbed the entire load exerted by the engine, and this increased loading likely in turn increased the friction at the contact surfaces beyond the capacity of the lubrication. Without sufficient lubricating capacity at the journals, the material would begin to heat excessively, creating local material deformation. The underlying reasons for the loose connection between the propeller hub and the crankshaft could not be determined, but it is likely that the extreme forces encountered during the flight\u2019s weather-induced upset and loss of control resulted in the ultimate failure of the connecting bolts.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to avoid an encounter with known adverse weather conditions, which resulted in an in-flight upset, temporary loss of control, and loading of the airframe, engine, and propeller that led to the in-flight separation of the propeller and the subsequent forced landing.

The airplane subsequently made numerous turns and altitude excursions, turning 90 degrees to the right and descending to 14,600 feet, then turning another 90 degrees right and descending to 14,100 feet. After making a sharp left turn, the airplane climbed to 15,500 feet, then made another sharp left turn, and, as it began a final rapid descent to the ground, the pilot issued several mayday calls. \u000b\u000bAn examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.\u000b\u000bThe expected ADS-B cockpit depiction compared to real-time, ground-based radar indicated significant differences in the depiction of hazardous reflectivity (rain). In the ADS-B product, the airplane was depicted as being clear of moderate or heavy rain as it made its final various turns. However, rea-time radar imagery indicated that the airplane would have been in or near moderate-to-heavy rain.\u000b\u000bThe pilot indicated to the controller that he was using ADS-B in a tactical manner; however, ADS-B is intended to be used in a strategic manner . It is unknown why the pilot lost control of the airplane in moderate-to-heavy rain; he may have become confused and lost situational awareness when turning into what he thought were clearer conditions per the ADS-B depiction but was actually worse weather. ADS-B does not show what the weather is; it shows what the weather was up to 15 to 20 minutes earlier.\u000b",

Following a flight of about 1.5 hours and after starting a descent, the pilot felt the left engine surge, and saw the left boost pump warning light flashing.  The left engine continued to surge and the boost pump light remained fully illuminated.  He chose not to feather the left propeller.  He engaged both emergency fuel boost pumps and advanced the throttles and propellers for both engines.  In this configuration the engines did not produce enough power to sustain flight.  ATC identified two nearby airports for the pilot; one airport was 6 miles away and the other was 2 miles away.  At 4,000 feet agl, the pilot felt he would not make either airport.  According to the manufacturer's published emergency procedures, once an inoperative engine has been identified and an unsuccessful engine restart attempt is made, the pilot should feather the propeller.  During the recovery, personnel noted that the inboard fuel tanks were full of fuel.  Both outboard tanks were empty; however, fuel was found on the ground by one of the outboard fuel tanks.  According to the operator, once a month the pilot's are encouraged to burn out the fuel in the outboard fuel tanks in VFR conditions.  Following the accident, a functional check was conducted of the continuous duty fuel boost pumps and emergency fuel boost pumps.  No discrepancies were noted.  According to the pilot's operating handbook (POH), the continuous duty fuel boost pump warning lights will illuminate when pressure to the system drops below 3 PSI or the boost pumps have failed. Engagement of the emergency fuel boost pumps provides steady fuel pressure.  The POH further reports that the fuel system has right and left fuel warning lights.  The fuel flow warning lights illuminate to warn the pilot of an impending fuel flow interruption.  These lights are located underneath the fuel boost pump warning lights.  If the fuel level near the tank outlet drops to a point where a fuel flow interruption and power loss could occur, a sensing probe will illuminate its corresponding warning light.

The landing gear was retracted and almost immediately, about 75 feet above ground level, the airplane entered a left turn and began to descend. The left descending turn continued to ground impact. On the day of the accident, the airplane was operating in high density altitude conditions, and was taking off with a tailwind of about 6 to 10 knots.  The airplane was loaded at, or very near to, its maximum allowable takeoff weight. (The takeoff weight was estimated to be within 50 pounds, plus or minus, of its maximum takeoff gross weight of 4,000 pounds.) The combination of the high density altitude, the tailwind, and the high gross weight most likely resulted in the pilot not being able to maintain altitude once the vertical component of the lift vector was reduced as a result of the bank angle during the left turns, which ultimately lead to the descent into the terrain.

The 6,271 hour certified flight instructor (CFI) demonstrated the preflight inspection step by step following the checklist for the prospective accident student; the inspection included examination of the swash plate assembly for security of the flight control push/pull tubes.  No preflight inspection discrepancies were later reported by the accident student.  The engine was started, and the flight departed to the west climbing to 500 feet msl, then descended to 300 feet.  The student reported that while flying straight and level at 60 knots while he was looking outside, the helicopter banked left and nose down, \"... making it impossible for the instructor to control the aircraft.\"  The CFI commented several times \"what happened\", and attempted to recover from the left and nose down attitude but was unable.  The CFI moved the cyclic control in an attempt to recover, but due to his (student's) confusion, could not recall what position he was moving it to.  The student perceived the helicopter impacted the ground first with the left skid.  The student did not notice any change in engine sound from the time of takeoff to the moment the helicopter banked left.  Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed the left forward push/pull tube was not connected to the swashplate assembly; the lug was not fractured.  The rod-end and securing hardware of the left push/pull tube was not located.  The securing hardware which secures the aft push/pull rod to the swashplate assembly was found to be loose; the threads of the bolt did not extend beyond the end of the nut and a palnut was not in position.  NTSB examination of the swashplate assembly revealed no elongation of the hole of the left forward lug; linear impressions on the interior surface were consistent with the threads of the bolt.  The impressions on the interior surface of the left forward lug were located in the area were the bolt shank is located.  Four days before the accident, tracking and balancing of the main rotor was accomplished.  The bracket used during the tracking procedure was installed to the left and aft lugs of the swashplate assembly, contrary to the procedure specified in the maintenance manual.  The mechanic who performed the work could not recall if he used a new metal self locking nut when reinstalling the push/pull rods.  Robinson Helicopter Company personnel reported that \"...if either of the forward push/pull tubes were to become disconnected at the lower swashplate, it is assumed that the helicopter would be uncontrollable.\"  Postaccident review of the operator's facility and several helicopters by NTSB and FAA personnel revealed several had the push/pull tubes installed on the incorrect side of the lugs at the swashplate assembly, and the securing hardware was incorrectly installed.  Additionally, FAA personnel noted discrepancies with the maintenance records.  One of the helicopters which had the push/pull tubes incorrectly installed, had been previously inspected on five separate occasions by one of the mechanics who had performed the last tracking and balancing of the main rotor on the accident helicopter.  Installation of the bracket used during the last main rotor tracking and balancing required the removal of the bolts at the left and aft lugs of the swash plate.  Proper installation of the bracket requires removal of hardware that secures 2 of 3 flight control push/pull tubes to the swashplate.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of company maintenance personnel to secure the push/pull tube to the left lug of the non-rotating portion of the swashplate assembly following maintenance, and the inability of the pilot to control the helicopter resulting in the in-flight collision with terrain."

They had intended to camp in tents while at the meeting. The pilot departed his home earlier in the morning, and flew to the Mid-Florida Airport to pick up a passenger. After arriving, the pilot told witnesses that during the flight, the airplane's center of gravity was aft, and he had to use a lot of forward trim to maintain level flight. The pilot and passenger hurriedly loaded the passenger's baggage on board the airplane, without weighing the baggage, and attempted to depart.

However, the flight was delayed to make an adjustment to the propeller lever friction lock. Because of the delay, the pilots departed after the sun had set and decided to fly directly to the other airport, which did not have runway lights. While en route, the right engine began to lose oil pressure and lost total power, so the pilot shut the engine down and feathered the propeller. The pilot elected to return to the departure airport, but was unable to maintain altitude. The airplane impacted trees and a postimpact fire consumed most of the airplane. According to witnesses, the airplane's nose gear landing strut was flat before departure and the pilots agreed they would leave the landing gear extended for the flight. Witnesses who saw the airplane just before impact confirmed the landing gear was extended. Postaccident examination of the right engine revealed the oil filter adapter was not properly assembled or adequately secured to the engine. The mechanic who performed maintenance to the oil adapter admitted that he did not follow the manufacturer's instructions when reassembling the adapter and when installing it on the engine. As a result, the adapter came loose during flight, which resulted in a loss of oil.

Shortly thereafter, when the airplane was at an altitude of about 2,400 feet, and in \"heavy rain,\" the pilot noticed that the right engine was losing power. He subsequently feathered the propeller as engine power reduced to 40 percent, but still did not raise the flaps. Weather, recorded shortly before the accident, included scattered clouds at 500 feet, and a broken cloud layer at 1,200 feet, and the pilot advised air traffic control (ATC) that he would fly an ILS (instrument landing system) approach if he could maintain altitude. After maneuvering, and advising ATC that he could not maintain altitude, the pilot descended the airplane to a right base leg where, about 1/4 nautical mile from the runway, it was approximately 300 feet above the terrain. The pilot completed the landing, with the airplane touching down about 6,200 feet down the 8,000-foot runway, heading about 20 degrees to the left. The airplane veered off the left side of the runway and subsequently went through an airport fence. The left engine was running at \u201chigh speed\u201d when fire fighters responded to the scene. The right engine propeller was observed in the feathered position at the scene, and after subsequent examinations, the right engine was successfully run in a test cell with no noticeable loss of power. There was no determination as to why the right engine lost power in flight, although rain ingestion is a possibility. Airplane performance calculations indicated that with the landing gear up, a proper single-engine power setting and airspeed, and flaps raised, the airplane should have been able to climb about 650 feet per minute. Even with flaps at 20 degrees, it should have been able to climb at 350 feet per minute. In either case, unless the airplane was not properly configured, there was no reason why it should not have been able to maintain the altitudes needed to position it for a stabilized approach.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s improper configuration of the airplane following an engine shutdown, which resulted in a low-altitude, unstabilized approach. Contributing to the accident was a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons."

After a normal downwind, base, and final approach, and about 160 yards down the runway, the aircraft was about to touch down when it started to veer to the left.

The pilot checked the magnetos and noted that all four cylinder head temperatures and all four exhaust gas temperatures were normal. He reduced engine power to 20 inches and 2,000 rpm, but the engine roughness increased, and the oil pressure dropped to 0 about 1 minute later. The pilot then completed a forced landing to a nearby National Guard base, but he could not completely align the airplane to the runway after it encountered the wake turbulence of a military jet departing in the opposite direction. The airplane landed at a 20- to 30-degree angle to the runway, veered off the right side, and struck a \u201crunway remaining\u201d sign before coming to a stop. After deplaning, the pilot saw engine oil covering the airplane\u2019s nose landing gear and the landing gear doors.Subsequent engine examination revealed that the No. 1 cylinder upper aft through bolt was sheared off, that the two No. 1 cylinder upper mounting studs had pulled loose from the crankcase, and that the crankcase at the No. 1 cylinder aft lower through bolt was cracked and separated; oil was leaking near it. Internal engine examinations revealed pitting and a frosty appearance of the metal on the Nos. 2 and 3 upper main bearing support webs consistent with fretting, which is typically a result of inadequate or loss of preload tension to fasteners. According to maintenance records, the engine underwent a major overhaul in 2002. In 2007, after about 490 hours of operation, a hairline crack was found in the engine case. The engine was disassembled and then reassembled with a rebuilt case.

The No. 2 cylinder was removed, the studs were replaced, and the No. 2 cylinder was then reinstalled. It could not be determined when the fretting began due to the multiple opportunities during which the through bolt preload tension could have been affected. However, by the time of the accident, the fretting had progressed sufficiently that it likely resulted in excessive loads to the fractured through bolt, loosened the cylinder studs, and subsequently twisted the cylinder, which then fractured the crankcase.\u00a0",

Although the pilot regained control of the glider, it was descending. When the glider had descended to about 10,000 feet mean sea level, the pilot chose to bail out with a parachute due to the descent rate and the unfavorable terrain for landing. The glider subsequently impacted a mesa and sustained substantial damage. Subsequent examination of the adjustable rudder pedal system revealed that the right rudder cable had fractured at the forward opening of the S-tube on the right rudder pedal. Examination of the rudder pedal design configuration revealed that full-forward deflection of the rudder pedal forced the cable to sharply bend at the point where it exited the forward opening of the S-tube, which was confirmed by a corresponding wear pattern on the accident glider\u2019s S-tube. The repeated bending during normal operation resulted in the fatigue failure of 92 percent of the individual right rudder cable wires and, subsequently, final overstress failure of the remaining wires. After the accident, the owner of another glider of the same design examined the rudder cable on his glider and found similar damage to the cable. Subsequently, he conducted ground testing, which confirmed that repeated operation of the rudder pedals resulted in further damage to the rudder cables, indicating a progressive failure. Therefore, it is likely that the right rudder cable failed during the flight and resulted in the loss of rudder control. The glider manufacturer subsequently issued service bulletins and service letters to address the rudder pedal system deficiencies discovered during the accident investigation. Flight testing conducted by the manufacturer in an exemplar glider confirmed that the glider would have been controllable if the pilot had not chosen to bail. However, the flight testing was conducted under controlled conditions, and the test pilot was fully aware of the modifications made to the exemplar glider to simulate the cable failure. Further, despite these modifications, the test pilot was still able to fully control the rudder, if necessary, during the flight test. Since the accident pilot did not have knowledge of the nature of the control problem and did not have the ability to gain full rudder control, his decision to bail out of the airplane was understandable.",

The flightcrew was unable to pressurize the passenger cabin, and elected to divert the flight to another airport, where the airplane landed uneventfully.  Inspection of the airplane revealed a gash about 3 feet long, by 1 foot wide on the underside of the fuselage, aft of the passenger entry door, and damage to the right nose gear tire.  Inspection of the runway at the departure airport revealed an in-ground light cover, that weighted about 100 pounds, was separated from its mount, broken in two pieces, and lying on the runway.  Black marks, consistent in color and texture to rubber, and resembling a tire tread, were observed on the optical lighting well, and on the underside of the light fixture.  The light cover was part of an in-ground, semi-flush mounted approach lighting fixture installed at the approach end of the runway in 1997.

The operator\u2019s written guidance for \u201cskydiving jump runs\u201d indicated that the airspeed should be maintained at 110 to 120 mph and that the flaps should be set at 30 degrees. As the airplane arrived at the planned drop location, the parachutists stood up, opened the door, and moved farther aft in the airplane to prepare for their jump. Five of the parachutists were positioned aft of the straddle benches and were hanging onto the outside of the airplane, several of the other parachutists were standing in the door, and the remainder of the parachutists were standing in the cabin forward of the door. According to instructions on the operator's skydiver briefing card, no more than four jumpers should be allowed to occupy the door area during exit. Several parachutists heard the sounds of the airplane\u2019s stall warning system, and the airplane then suddenly rolled and began to descend. All 12 parachutists quickly exited the airplane. Several witnesses reported seeing the airplane turning and descending in an inverted nose-down attitude and then appear to briefly recover, but it then entered a nearly vertical dive, which is consistent with a loss of control event as a result of an aerodynamic stall and subsequent entry into a spin. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidance indicates that the pilot-in-command (PIC) must know the weight and location of jumpers during each phase of the flight to assure that the aircraft stays within center of gravity (CG) limits and that the PIC must remain aware of CG shifts and their effects on aircraft controllability and stability as jumpers move into position for exiting the aircraft. Further FAA guidance indicated that, if a stall recovery is not promptly initiated, the airplane is more likely to enter an inadvertent spin, which can degenerate into a spiral. It is likely that the number of parachutists near the door area during exit shifted the CG aft and contributed to the aerodynamic stall/spin.\u000b\u000bThe pilot suffered a serious traumatic brain injury in September 2005 as a result of colliding with a truck while bicycling; however, he did not report that injury during all subsequent FAA medical certificate applications.

            "probable_cause": "the pilot's improper use of carburetor heat which resulted in a continuing loss of engine power, and the right landing gear's failure to extend during a single engine approach.  A factor was the insufficient time available to extend the landing gear via the emergency extension procedure. "

During both, she performed touch-and-go landings.  Following the second flight, her instructor exited the airplane, and the flight departed and remained in the traffic pattern where she performed one touch-and-go landing.  The flight remained in the traffic pattern and during the second touch-and-go landing, the airplane touched down and bounced two times.  After the second bounce she reduced power and lowered the nose but the airplane then bounced again.  Following the third bounce, she heard the stall warning horn and the \"nose dropped.\"  She then heard the propeller contacting the runway.  The student's certified flight instructor (CFI) reported the student's first approach was similar to the landings she had performed when he was in the airplane, and the approach for the second landing appeared good.  He noted the flare was good and for some reason, the airplane bounced two times then touched down collapsing the nose landing gear.",

During his return to his departure airport the student pilot stated that he did a go-around on his first landing attempt because of surface winds which he recalled were gusting to 37 knots.   On the second landing attempt the student pilot stated that a gust of wind pushed him down to the runway.  The airplane then bounced and landed hard on the nose gear causing structural damage to the nose gear and the firewall.   A review of the student pilot's logbook shows the flight instructor had cleared the student pilot for the solo long cross country flight even though the student pilot's logbook endorsement showed a maximum surface wind limitation of 20 knots.",

The pilot conducted a forced landing in a nearby field. An on-site inspection revealed that the airplane fuel tanks contained plenty of fuel.  A post accident examination of the engines was conducted. An engine monitor was downloaded; a sudden decrease in cylinder head (CHT) and exhaust gas (EGT) temperature readings were observed for the right engine.  A visual inspection of the engine revealed that the idler gear support pin, located on the rear of the engine, had backed out.  The idler pin's retaining hardware (two nuts and lock-washers) were missing.  The idler pin's movement allowed the idler gear to drop and become disconnected from the magnetos drive gear, resulting in a loss of engine ignition.  Additionally, due to the mis-located idler gear, the accessory drive gears on the cam and crankshafts were either ground down or broken.  Disassembly of the engine, found numerous metal pieces in the engine's oil sump.",
