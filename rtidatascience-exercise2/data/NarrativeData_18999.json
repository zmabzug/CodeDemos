Satellite imagery depicted cloud top temperatures of -1 to -3 degrees C between 11,000 and 12,000 feet msl.  The location of the last radar return was immediately downwind of Mt. Rainier and the sounding wind profile indicated favorable conditions for mountain wave formation. Digital photos of Mt. Rainier taken a few minutes before the accident were recovered from a camera onboard the airplane.  The images depict a clear view of clouds surrounding Mt. Rainier and that the airplane was operating immediately above a broken-to-overcast cloud layer, in visual meteorological conditions. The radar track combined with weather radar imagery and satellite imagery indicated that the airplane was in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) at the time it entered the descending right turn and dropped below the radar floor. Flight performance data recovered from cockpit instrumentation indicate that 5 minutes prior to the accident the airplane experienced continuous turbulence ranging from 0.77 to 1.5 vertical g's, consistent with a mountain wave encounter. Upon entering IMC conditions, the airplane began a right turn that developed into a spiral descent. During the last few seconds of flight the airplane was oriented 88.6 degrees nose down, 113 degrees angle of bank, and 290 knots. Upon exiting the bottom of the cloud layer, at 6,135 msl, the airplane experienced a rapid onset of g's that exceeded the strength of the airplane.  The sudden onset of g-load is constant with the pilot's attempt to recover from the rapid descent and unusual attitude.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while in cruise flight due to spatial disorientation.  Contributing to the accident was turbulence and clouds."

The helicopter touched down on a road and skidded into a parked automobile. \u000b\u000bA postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that the mixture cable had fracture-separated from the mixture bellcrank control arm located on the carburetor. The bellcrank was positioned near the idle/cutoff position, and the spring was inserted in the wrong direction. The helicopter airframe had undergone an overhaul about 16 hours of flight time before the accident, and, during that overhaul, a mechanic\u2019s apprentice installed the mixture hardware. The apprentice improperly rigged the mixture-to-bellcrank hardware, which prevented the mixture cable from moving freely. The repeated stress on the mixture cable resulted in it breaking after a number of operation cycles. When the failure occurred, the bellcrank spring, which is designed to force the mixture to the full-rich position, instead pulled the mixture to the idle/cutoff position, which cut off the fuel. The mechanic overseeing the apprentice reported that he did not visually observe the misrigging and that, if he had performed a tactile inspection, he would have detected the error. \u000b",

The purpose of the flight was to pick up two passengers from the Louisiana Regional Airport, Gonzales, Louisiana, and take them to the Waynesboro Municipal Airport (2RO), Waynesboro, Mississippi. After dropping his passengers off, the pilot resumed the flight to MOB. When the pilot did not arrive at MOB that evening, his wife contacted a man who worked with him at the Mobile fixed base operator (FBO). The man stated that he heard the pilot on the radio attempting to reach the MOB FBO. However, he said, there was no answer, and no distress was noted in the call. The pilot was unable to land due to bad weather in the area. He then flew back to 2RO, and from there he called his wife in Mobile and advised her that he would stay at 2RO until it opened on March 16, then he would refuel and return back to MOB. Personnel at 2RO reported that they did not see the pilot's airplane on the morning of March 16, 1982. The pilot's wife contacted the local authorities, family, and friends. Search parties organized land and air searches and the news media were contacted. A woman who lived in the Big Creek Lake area called a television station, after seeing the report on television, to report that she heard a small plane in \"distress\" flying over the lake on the morning of March 16, 1982, between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. A search party searched the lake, but could not find the pilot or the airplane. On March 28, 1982 a teenage boy was fishing in Big Creek Lake when he discovered a body, which was later determined to be that of the pilot.

A postincident examination revealed that brackets holding an elevator stop had fractured, causing the elevator movement to partially jam. The fractures were consistent with fatigue failure and were caused by a combination of improperly installed shim stacks, poor alignment of the L-brackets, and cyclic stresses acting on the lower stop, which were generated by the repeated improper use of the gust lock system.

Fragments from the burst disk partially severed the LPT case and struck the fuselage in multiple locations. The airframe vibration increased to a severe level until the LPT rotor separated from the engine, about 14 minutes 30 seconds after the uncontained LPT stage 1 disk burst, when the high pressure turbine aft shaft and the fan mid shaft failed due to contact damage and torsional loading. Metallurgical examination of the portion of the LPT stage 1 disk that was imbedded in the right wing found that the disk burst due to a mixture of high cycle and low cycle fatigue. The fracture was located in the vicinity of the forward seal tooth serration, although the exact fracture origin could not be identified because the entire seal tooth and part of the seal tooth arm were missing at the fracture location. Examination of the forward seal tooth serration revealed the presence of two previous weld repairs that extended into the forward arm. Review of the manufacturing records revealed that the disk had been dabber weld repaired twice to correct anomalies and non-conformances found during the original manufacturing process. The dabber weld procedures did not authorize welding in the forward seal tooth serration, therefore, the weld repair performed on the failed LPT stage 1 disk did not conform to the approved repair instructions. Based on testing and analysis of sample, post-manufacture dabber weld repaired disks, the suspect population of CF6 disks was confined to those that had been repaired at original manufacture. Records indicated that, in addition to the accident disk, four other disks had been dabber weld repaired at original manufacture to correct forward seal tooth serration anomalies and non-conformances. None of these disks are any longer in service. Based on the estimated crack propagation rate, it is likely that either no crack existed at the last inspection of the disk or the crack size was below the reasonably detectable threshold. After the disk burst, the flight crew completed all required checklists; however, the crew could not manually shutdown the affected engine because the burst disk fragments had severed the fire shutoff valve cable, the power off cable, and the emergency shutoff cable. The engine eventually shutdown on its own due to airflow disruptions within the engine. The flight crew\u2019s procedural coordination and use of available resources, consistent with cockpit resource management best practices, helped to ensure the safe landing of the airplane.",
            "probable_cause": "The rupture of a fatigue crack in the forward air seal tooth serration of the No. 3 engine low pressure turbine stage 1 disk that initiated due to an improper weld repair performed during original manufacture. The improper weld repair changed the material properties of the disk near the weld feature, resulting in an accelerated crack propagation rate that allowed the crack to grow to rupture before the next inspection interval. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the inability of the flight crew to shutdown the engine as a result of the damage caused by a liberated piece of the low pressure turbine stage 1 disk when it punctured the right wing."

A witness heard the airplane approach from the east, and observed the airplane at a height consistent with the approach minimums for the VOR approach.  The airplane continued over the runway, and entered a \"tight\" downwind.  The witness lost visual contact with the airplane due to it \"skimming\" into or behind clouds.  The airplane reappeared from the clouds at an altitude of about 200 feet above the ground on a base leg.  As it overshot the extended centerline for the runway, the bank angle increased to about 90-degrees.  The airplane then descended out of view.  The witness described the weather to the north and northeast of the airport, as poor visibility with \"scuddy\" clouds.  According to CVR and FDR data, about 1.5 miles from the runway with the first officer at the controls, and south of the extended runway centerline, the airplane turned left, and then back toward the right.  During that portion of the flight, the first officer stated, \"what happens if we break out, pray tell.\"  The captain replied, \"uh, I don't see it on the left side it's gonna be a problem.\"  When the airplane was about 1/8-mile south of the runway threshold, the first officer relinquished the controls to the captain.  The captain then made an approximate 60-degree heading change to the right back toward the runway.  The airplane crossed over the runway at an altitude of 200 feet, and began a left turn towards the center of the airport.  During the turn, the first officer set the flaps to 20 degrees.  The airplane reentered a left downwind, about 1,100 feet south of the runway, at an altitude of 400 feet.  As the airplane turned onto the base leg, the captain called for \"flaps twenty,\" and the first officer replied, \"flaps twenty coming in.\"   The CVR recorded the sound of a click, followed by the sound of a trim-in-motion clicker.  The trim-in-motion audio clicker system would not sound if the flaps were positioned beyond 3 degrees.   About 31 seconds later, the CVR recorded a sound similar to a stick pusher stall warning tone.  The airplane impacted a rooftop of a residential home about 1/4-mile northeast of the approach end of the runway, struck trees, a second residential home, a second line of trees, a third residential home, and came to rest in a river.  Examination of the wreckage revealed the captain's airspeed indicator reference bug was set to 144 knots, and the first officer's was set to 124 knots.  The flap selector switch was observed in the \"UP\" position.  A review of the Airplane Flight Manual revealed the stall speeds for flap positions of 0 and 8 degrees, and a bank angle of 60 degrees, were 164 and 148 knots respectfully.  There were no charts available to calculate stall speeds for level coordinated turns in excess of 60 degrees.  The flightcrew was trained to apply procedures set forth by the airplane's Technical Manual, which stated, \"\u2026The PF (Pilot Flying) will call for flap and gear extension and retraction.  The PNF (Pilot not flying) will normally actuate the landing gear.  The PNF will respond by checking appropriate airspeed, repeating the flap or gear setting called for, and placing the lever in the requested position... The PNF should always verify that the requested setting is reasonable and appropriate for the phase of flighty and speed/weight combination.\"",

Water was also found where the galley drain exits the pressure vessel and enters the fairing area. Water was observed draining from the black foam wrap around the drain tube\u2019s heating element, and the black foam exhibited deformation consistent with the expansion of frozen water. Removal of the foam revealed an opening in the drain tube. Testing of the galley drain heating element revealed that it was inoperative.

While en route, an air traffic controller queried the pilot if he had the current weather information for his destination airport. The pilot acknowledged that he did. The pilot then requested vectors for a VOR DME-A instrument approach, but the controller was unable to give vectors and cleared the pilot direct to the initial approach fix (the VOR). The controller then informed the pilot that he was \u201cconstantly\u201d 300-400 feet below his assigned altitude and reissued the local altimeter setting before clearing him for the approach. About a minute later, the pilot canceled his instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan when he was about 3-4 miles north of the VOR. The controller acknowledged the cancellation and approved a frequency change. There were no further communications or transmissions between the pilot and air traffic control. A review of radar data revealed that the airplane traveled on a southerly heading toward the VOR. An airport employee heard the pilot announce over the UNICOM frequency that he was crossing over the VOR and transitioning from IFR to visual flight rules flight; however, the weather at the airport was reported to be 1.5 miles visibility.

Just prior to the discharge event, the flight crew observed a phenomenon known as St. Elmo's Fire, during which time loud popping noises were heard in the radios.  After the discharge, sparks, smoke, and a strong acrid smell of electrical burning were noted from near the co-pilot's over window panel.  The smoke and fume checklist was performed, halon was applied on two separate occasions, and the relative circuit breakers and electrical switches were opened.  The flight landed uneventfully 45 minutes later.  Post incident examination of the affected wires revealed that electrical arcing and shorting had occurred between the airplane structure, a clamp, and a 30-wire bundle.  The affected wire bundle passed behind the flight engineer's station and overhead to the heated windshields.  The wire bundle and its clamps were examined and it was noted that the wires were insulated with aromatic polyimide, which is susceptible to arc tracking and insulation flashover.  Though the insulation did not display complete insulation breaches, it was noted that the arcing event initiated near a clamp, which was destroyed by the event.  The clamp aft of the burned area was of normal size, while the clamp forward of the destroyed one was too small.  It is plausible the insulation was either chafed or crimped by the damaged clamp, allowing the arcing event to take place.  In turn, the arc tracking and insulation flashover then consumed the surrounding wires.",

Visual meteorological conditions predominantly prevailed along the route of flight; however, analysis of the weather reports disclosed conditions consistent with broken to overcast clouds having bases at 4,000 feet msl in the vicinity of the accident site.  An AIRMET had been issued for the area for IFR conditions, with mountain obscuration, precipitation, mist, and fog.  The helicopter was equipped with a satellite-based tracking system that reports the helicopter's GPS location to the operator's ground base while the system is in operation, and the data for the accident flight was reviewed. The route of flight proceeded toward the apex of a mountain pass, which is the main transition route from one side of a mountain range to the other, where the helicopter's base is located.  The tracking data indicated that the helicopter appeared to follow a major highway in the lower portion of the pass.  The highway makes a large \"S\" shaped path as it gains in elevation toward the top of the pass, which is about 4,200 feet mean sea level (msl).  The route along the highway is away from a well-lit major city area that has a well-defined light horizon, toward rising and dark terrain with no ground reference lights other than vehicles on the highway.  Once at the top of the pass as the highway turns toward the northeast, the upper desert communities on the other side of the mountain range once again provide a well-lit and clearly defined horizon.  Near the upper end of the pass, the helicopter's satellite derived flight track showed that it inexplicably diverged toward the east, away from the highway, instead of continuing to follow the highway into the upper desert valley.  The helicopter collided with terrain about 0.7 nautical miles east of the highway at 4,026 feet msl.  The accident site was located in a small ravine, near the base of a 100-foot tall electrical transmission tower that was located along the ravine's east ridge.  During subsequent examination of the airframe structures, flight control components, and engines, no pre-impact anomalies were found that would have precluded normal operation prior to impact.  While the operator was in the process of equipping its helicopter fleet with night vision goggles, the accident helicopter had not as yet been equipped with any enhanced night vision devices. The helicopter was equipped for instrument flight, including a 3-axis autopilot.  The first fire department responders to the accident site reported that the area was covered by what they described as \"intermittent waves\" of fog that would suddenly form and then dissipate, which made it difficult to locate the wreckage.",

The flight instructor and the student pilot were killed, and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to and operated by a private individual, as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight. Day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed and a flight plan had not been filed. The airplane departed Pearland Regional Airport (LVJ), Pearland, Texas, about 0910 and was destined to return to LVJ.No witnesses to the accident have yet been found. A motorist driving on a remote unpaved road in the national wildlife refuge saw the wreckage and called 9-1-1 emergency about 1130. Postaccident radar forensics show the airplane first appeared on radar about 0915 near LVJ and radar contact was lost at 1004. Evidence at the scene showed the airplane was moving to the northwest when it impacted terrain. The wreckage was fragmented along the ground for about 110 feet and the outer portion of the left wing was completely separated near the initial impact scar. The engine compartment and forward cockpit area were impact damaged and partially separated from the main cabin area and the fuselage, which came to rest in a nose down attitude. There was a significant fuel spill at the scene, but there was no postimpact fire.The remaining on-board fuel was examined and no evidence of fuel contamination was found. At the LVJ facility where the airplane had most recently been refueled, refueling unit records and a review of security camera video showed that the airplane had been refueled with aviation gasoline and postaccident fuel quality checks of that fuel facility were satisfactory.The wreckage was moved to a different location and will be further examined. A handheld GPS device and several avionics components containing non-volatile memory (NVM), including engine performance data, were removed from the wreckage for examination and an extraction of useful data is possible.The closest official weather reporting station was at Texas Gulf Coast Regional Airport (KLBX), Angleton/Lake Jackson, Texas, located 14 miles north-northeast from the accident location. At 0953 the Automated Surface Observation System at KLBX reported wind from 190 degrees at 12 knots, visibility 10 miles, sky clear of clouds, temperature 31 degrees Celsius (C), dew point 22 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.94 inches of Mercury.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.According to an interview with the pilot, while en route to an unmanned offshore platform South Pass 38 in the Gulf of Mexico, the cloud ceilings were about 500 feet and the visibility was about 5 miles. However, as the helicopter neared the destination platform, the flight entered deteriorating weather. The pilot estimated that the cloud ceiling was about 300 feet and that the visibility was about 1 mile when he began circling to land on the platform. Although the weather conditions did not meet Air Logistics\u2019 operating minimums, which required a 500 foot cloud ceiling and 3 miles of visibility, the pilot decided to continue to the destination platform, despite having the option to divert to another station. About 1 mile from the platform, as the pilot was maneuvering in an attempt to reduce the airspeed, the helicopter began an inadvertent descent and then entered an aerodynamic buffet that hindered the pilot\u2019s ability to maintain straight and level flight. The buffet was most likely caused by the helicopter entering transverse flow effect (unequal lift vectors between the front and rear portions of the rotor disc) and by a reduction in lift vectors, which resulted from the tailwind that was present. After encountering the buffet, the pilot was unable to maintain control of the helicopter or to stop the helicopter\u2019s descent before it impacted the water. The accident helicopter was equipped with externally mounted floats, which could have been deployed by actuating a trigger mounted on the cyclic. The helicopter was also equipped with two externally mounted liferafts that could have been deployed either by pulling an interior T-handle near the pilot\u2019s left leg or by pulling one of the two externally mounted T-handles on the helicopter\u2019s skid cross bar. According to a supplemental type certificate for the helicopter, a placard was only mounted near the interior T-handle. According to a pilot interview and a written statement obtained by Air Logistics, the pilot did not attempt to activate the helicopter\u2019s flotation system or liferafts before water impact because he was preoccupied with recovering from the buffet. The accident pilot provided no indication why he did not deploy the external liferafts using the internal T-handle when the helicopter entered the water, even though he had received training on external liferaft deployments. Air Logistics\u2019 training program and operating manual expected company pilots to deploy the floats before water impact but did not address pilot expectations in the event of water impact without floats deployed. Lacking additional guidance, the pilot reverted to his water survival training and immediately exited the helicopter. All of the occupants survived the impact, exited the helicopter, and inflated their lifejackets. The pilot was unable to reach the external liferaft T-handles on the skids and attempted to direct the passengers to deploy the liferafts. However, because the pilot had not conducted a passenger briefing (including instructions on how to deploy the liferaft system), the passengers did not know that liferafts were available externally and did not understand how to deploy the liferafts using the external T-handles before the helicopter sank. Under 14 CFR 135.117, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires pilots to ensure that, before flight, all passengers on flights involving extended overwater operations are orally briefed on ditching procedures and the use of required flotation equipment; however, the accident flight did not meet the 14 CFR 1.1 definition of an extended overwater operation because it was operating within 50 nautical miles of the shoreline. Per the Air Logistics flight operations manual (FOM), a passenger briefing was required that would have included the location of emergency equipment, such as seat belts, exits, lifejackets, and fire extinguishers. The FOM did not specify that liferaft locations were to be part of the briefing.[2] Regardless, no passenger safety briefing was provided before departure. Air Logistics passenger briefing cards, which were stowed in a pouch on the cabin sidewall for each passenger seat, provided directions on how to operate different emergency equipment; however, the briefing cards did not provide guidance on which equipment was installed on the helicopter. In addition, at the time of the accident, there were no placards to aid in recognition of the external liferaft activation handles.The passengers and the pilot attempted to swim to the platform, which was about 100 yards from the impact location, but were separated by high waves and were moved away from the platform by the current. About 1551, an Air Logistics radio operator mistakenly recorded the helicopter as \u201clanded\u201d in the company\u2019s flight-following database. Because the helicopter was placed in the \u201clanded\u201d status, the flight-tracking program did not trigger any overdue notifications. About 34 minutes later (1 hour after the crash), the error was discovered by the Air Logistics base manager in Venice, Louisiana, because the pilot had not reported his status before sunset. As a result, the company diverted a field boat toward the offshore platform to search for the helicopter; however, the field boat was too far away to aid the survivors. The weather conditions precluded the launch of another helicopter to assist in the search. About 1 hour 15 minutes after the crash, the crewmembers of a shrimp trawler contacted the U.S. Coast Guard to report that they had retrieved two survivors and a deceased passenger from the water. The water temperature near the accident location was about 49 degrees Fahrenheit, and the passenger died of hypothermia secondary to asphyxia from drowning. A Coast Guard ship rescued the severely hypothermic pilot more than 4 hours after the estimated time of the crash. The pilot did not report engine power loss or control malfunction. The passengers did not report seeing any warning lights or hearing any aural warnings before the accident. An examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded safe flight or the production of engine power.On October 20, 2008, the NTSB issued two recommendations pertaining to this accident. Safety Recommendation A-08-83 asked for the installation of a placard for each external T handle on turbine-powered helicopters with externally mounted liferafts that clearly identifies the location of and provides activation instructions for the handle. Safety Recommendation A 08-84 recommended that all operators of turbine-powered helicopters be required to include information about the location and activation of internal or external liferafts in pilot preflight safety briefings to passengers before each takeoff. Both recommendations are classified \u201cOpen\u2014Response Received.\u201dSafety Recommendation A-07-88, which the NTSB issued on October 19, 2007, also applies to this accident. In the recommendation, the NTSB asked the FAA to require that all offshore helicopter operators in the Gulf of Mexico provide their flight crews with beacon-equipped personal flotation devices; Safety Recommendation A-07-88 is currently classified \u201cOpen\u2014Acceptable Response,\u201d based on the FAA\u2019s plan to consult with operators on the best ways to increase the chance of survival in a ditching and the issuance of an information for operators that describes recommendations to mitigate the risks and hazards for helicopters that may have to ditch in the Gulf. As a result of the accident, Air Logistics has initiated a program requiring that each pilot be provided a lifejacket equipped with a 406-megahertz emergency position indicating radio beacon that has full two-way voice capability and that is waterproof to 10 meters. This program requirement is consistent with the intent of the recommendation even without the FAA requiring it.Additionally, personal locator beacons (without two-way voice capability) have been installed in Air Logistics liferafts. Air Logistics also has started installing water-activated switches on the flotation system and liferafts for its Bell 407 helicopters; the switches are being installed during each helicopter\u2019s next maintenance or inspection visit. Placards have also been placed on the underside of aircraft showing the mechanism for manual deployment of liferafts when the aircraft is upside down in the water. To standardize the briefing information given to passengers, the preflight briefing checklist, passenger briefing cards, and passenger briefing tapes have been revised to include information on the location and operation of liferafts.In addition, the company produced an initial and recurrent training video to include more detailed information on how to deploy the flotation system and liferafts installed on its helicopters, including footage of an actual deployment, and has revamped its aircraft type-specific briefing videos for passengers. The training and briefing videos are shown to all first-time passengers before they depart their shore base. Air Logistics also has a separate video specifically on raft and float deployment, which includes manual deployment from outside the aircraft; according to the company, this video usually runs continually in the waiting rooms at the shore base. Thus far, Air Logistics pilots and passengers have given positive feedback on the training and briefing videos.To address the problem of misreporting helicopter status, a senior company pilot now assists the radio operator with oversight of helicopters, and helicopter pilots are required to provide position reports every 30 minutes, regardless of whether their helicopter is airborne or has landed. The radio operator and the senior pilot monitor any pilot who requests a longer delay to eat lunch or take a restroom break, for example. Also, to eliminate inadvertent changes in helicopter status, an additional keystroke has been added to confirm that a helicopter has landed.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s decision to continue to the destination landing platform in weather conditions below the company\u2019s weather minimums and his failure to maintain aircraft control during the approach. Contributing to the passenger fatality and the severity of the occupant injuries were the lack of a passenger briefing on how to deploy the liferaft, which was required by the company but not by the Federal Aviation Administration because this flight was not an extended overwater operation; the pilot\u2019s failure to deploy the liferafts; and the company radio operator\u2019s misreporting of the helicopter\u2019s \u201clanded\u201d status, which delayed the rescue response."

He noted that the engine exhaust temperatures had dropped but that other engine indications were normal. The pilot elected to divert to an intermediate airport; however, the engine continued to lose power, and the pilot was unable to maintain a proper glide path to the runway. The pilot was concerned about an inadvertent aerodynamic stall, so he made a forced landing to the bean field short of the runway. Postaccident bench testing of the engine fuel injection servo revealed variations in fuel flow that were not consistent with normal servo operation. Further examination of the fuel servo revealed that the mixture control valve O-ring was damaged and that a fragment of the O-ring was located on the surface of the mixture control valve plate.

Prior to starting the approach, the flightcrew determined that the landing approach speed (Vref) and the approach speed (Vapp) were 122 and 128 knots, respectively.  DFDR data showed the airplane flying on autopilot as it passed the middle marker at 200 feet AGL at 130 knots on the ILS approach.  Approximately 3 seconds after the first officer called \"runway in sight twelve o'clock,\" the captain disconnected the autopilot, while at a radio altitude of 132 feet and on a heading of approximately 18 degrees.  Within approximately 11 seconds after the autopilot disconnect, the glideslope and localizer deviation increased.  The first officer called \"runway over there.\"  Approximately 5 seconds before touchdown, the airplane rolled right, then left, then right.   DFDR data-based performance calculations showed the airplane crossed the threshold at an altitude of 35 feet and 130 knots. The airplane touched down 2,802 feet from the approach end of the 5,495-foot runway (844-foot displaced threshold) at 125 knots on a heading of 10 degrees.  The airplane overran the runway and struck a ditch 175 feet beyond the departure end of the runway.   Landing roll calculations showed a ground roll of 2,693 feet after touchdown, consisting of 1,016 feet ground roll before braking was initiated and 1,677 feet ground roll after braking was initiated until the airplane exited the pavement.  According to Saab, for a wet runway, the aircraft would have needed 1,989 feet from the time of braking initiation to come to a complete stop.  The American Eagle Airlines, Inc., FAA approved aircraft operating manual (AOM), states in part:  Stabilized approaches are essential when landing on contaminated runways.  Landing under adverse weather conditions, the desired touch-down point is  still 1,000 feet from the approach end of the runway.  Touchdown at the planned point.  Cross the threshold at Vapp, then bleed off speed to land approximately Vref -5.  Use reverse, if needed.  To achieve maximum braking effect on wet runway, apply maximum and steady brake pressure.  In 1992, the City of Killeen submitted a proposal that included extending the north end of runway 01 by 194 feet.  The FAA originally disapproved the proposal, in part, because the runway extension decreased the length of the runway safety area (RSA) which was already shorter than the recommended 1,000 feet for a 14 CFR Part 139 certificated airport.  The proposal was subsequently approved and a drainage ditch was installed in the north RSA, perpendicular to the runway and approximately 175 feet north of the departure end of runway 01.  In 1993, the airport received FAA Part 139 certification.  The 1998 and 1999, FAA airport certification inspection reports noted the inadequate RSA; however, neither letter of correction, sent from the FAA to the City of Killeen following the inspections, mentioned the RSA.  Following this accident, the ILS runway 01 was flight checked by the FAA and all components were found to be operating within prescribed tolerances.  Examination of the airplane found no anomalies that would have prevented it from operating per design prior to departing the runway and encountering the ditch.",
            "probable_cause": "the captain's failure to follow standard operating procedure for landing on a contaminated ruway in that he touched down long, which combined with his delayed braking resulted in a runway overrun.  Contributing factors were the captain's failure to maintain runway alignment following his disconnect of the autopilot, the gusty crosswind and the wet runway.  In addition, the following were contributing factors: (1) the airport operator's failure to fill in a ditch in the runway safety area, (2) the FAA's granting of 14 CFR Part 139 approval to the airport when the runway safety area (RSA) did not meet the recommended length for a Part 139 airport, and (3) the FAA's continued lack of acknowledgement to the airport of the inadequate RSA following their annual airport inspection checks."

While en route to his destination, the pilot decided to switch the fuel supply to come from the left tank rather than the right, in an effort to remedy a slight fuel imbalance. Shortly after changing the tank selection, the engine experienced a total loss of power. Despite multiple attempts, the pilot was unable to restart the engine and initiated a forced landing to a nearby field. The pilot stated that, due to a headwind, he was unable to reach his original intended landing area and decided on a second field, closer to his position.
