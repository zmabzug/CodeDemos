The commercial pilot and one passenger were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed Akron Fulton International Airport (AKR), Akron, Ohio, about 1513, and was destined for Spartanburg Downtown Memorial Airport (SPA), Spartanburg, South Carolina. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Preliminary air traffic control information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration indicated that after departure, the pilot climbed the airplane to an altitude of 12,000 feet on a direct course to SPA, and established radio communications with air traffic control (ATC).  About 1612, the pilot requested and was cleared to make a 30-degree left turn to maneuver around an area of precipitation.  About 1625, the pilot initiated a left turn to the north and began to descend, and when queried by ATC, stated that he was deviating around weather. The airplane subsequently turned right, made a 270-degree turn, and began tracking south, then southwest, before radio contact was lost with the pilot. Subsequently the flight was lost from radar contact and at 1653 emergency operators received calls concerning the accident. Two witnesses near the accident site observed the airplane as it overflew their home. They described the sound of the engine as \"loud,\" but stated that it was fading in and out. They both stated that the airplane was in a nose-down, right bank attitude as it descended into trees. They subsequently heard the sound of impact, but did not see any smoke or fire in the vicinity of the crash site. The witnesses reported that the weather was overcast, and that about 10 minutes after the accident, it began raining. The wreckage was located on a densely-wooded hillside at an elevation of about 1,400 feet.  The initial impact point was identified by broken tree branches and the right wingtip fairing.

Please see the public docket for this accident to view the original report.**According to air traffic control (ATC) audio recordings, a tower controller cleared an airplane for takeoff about 23 seconds after a UH-60 helicopter was cleared for takeoff from a midfield location. The tower controller ensured that a runway separation standard of 3,000 feet was present and did not give a wake turbulence advisory. The flight instructor reported that she was aware of the helicopter's takeoff and that she perceived adequate separation from the helicopter. The flight instructor incorrectly identified the helicopter as a Bell UH-1, which weighs less than the UH-60. Shortly after takeoff, the airplane encountered the wake vortex of the helicopter and entered a steep left bank. The flight instructor attempted to counteract the left roll with full right aileron inputs, but she was unable to maintain control. The airplane impacted terrain near midfield and came to rest inverted. A review of ATC audio recordings and airplane performance data revealed that the airplane trailed the helicopter by about 48 to 63 seconds at the midfield location and was about 150 to 200 feet above ground level when it encountered the helicopter's wake vortex. Current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ATC guidance does not require specific wake turbulence separation criteria for a small airplane following a helicopter nor does it require a controller to give a wake turbulence advisory for a small airplane following a helicopter.

The airplane began to stall, and the pilot activated the airplane\u2019s ballistic parachute recovery system. Subsequently, the airplane descended to the ground with the aid of the parachute and came to rest upright on a frozen lake. About 18 months before the accident flight, the airplane underwent maintenance to remove and replace both the left and right flaps. According to maintenance manual procedures, the mounting bolt and washer hardware were to be safety wired to the flap actuation fitting. However, during postaccident examinations, the right flap rod end was found disconnected from the right flap actuation fitting, and the connection hardware was missing. The mounting bolt and washer were found lying under the airplane; however, no safety wire was found. Therefore, the safety wire was most likely not installed when the right flap was reinstalled during maintenance. Although the mounting bolt and washer were likely tightened during the installation, they likely gradually became loose over time because of the missing safety wire, which led the right flap rod end to separate from the right flap actuation fitting during the flap extension on the accident flight. Since the time of the maintenance (211 hours of operation), annual, prebuy, and preflight inspections occurred, during which the lack of a safety wire went unnoticed. ",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of maintenance personnel to install a safety wire during reinstallation of the right flap, which led to the separation of the right flap rod from the right flap actuation fitting during flap extension. Contributing to the accident were inadequate inspections of the right flap during subsequent annual, prebuy, and preflight inspections."

The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to and operated by Central Airlines, Inc., dba Central Air Southwest, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 as an on-demand cargo charter flight. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from MDW about 0238. The intended destination was the Ohio State University Airport (OSU), Columbus, Ohio.Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control data (ATC) revealed that the flight was cleared for takeoff at 0238 from runway 31C, to be followed by a right turn to a heading of 110 degrees. About 2 minutes later, the pilot informed the MDW tower controller that he was having trouble with the left engine and requested to return to the airport. The pilot elected to fly a left-hand traffic pattern and return for a landing on runway 31C. At 0241, the controller cleared the pilot to land as requested.The initial ATC radar contact was recorded at 0240:34 (hhmm:ss) and located about 0.51 mile west-northwest of the departure threshold of runway 31C. The altitude associated with that data point was about 800 feet mean sea level (msl). The radar data depicted the airplane turning left to become established on a southwest course, paralleling runway 31C on a downwind traffic pattern leg. The final radar data point was recorded at 0242:01 and was located about 0.54 miles south-southwest of the approach threshold of runway 31C; this was about 0.15 miles southwest of the accident site. The altitude associate with the final data point was about 800 feet msl. The accident site was located 0.50 miles southeast of the runway 31C approach threshold.The airplane impacted a residence, with the forward fuselage coming to rest within the building. The southwest corner of the home was destroyed. Both wings remained attached to the fuselage. The left wing was located outside the building perimeter, with the wing tip resting on the ground. The right wing remained attached to the fuselage, with the outboard portion of the wing extending outside of the building perimeter and over the roof of the adjacent residence. The buildings were separated by approximately 10 feet. The left engine remained attached to the wing, and the left propeller remained attached to the engine. The right engine had separated from the wing and the right propeller had separated from the engine; both were located within the home. The aft fuselage and empennage remained attached to the remainder of the airframe. However, they were dislocated to the right relative to the forward fuselage. The aft fuselage/empennage came to rest on the roof of the adjacent residence. Damage to that home appeared limited to the roof and soffit area at the northeast corner of the structure. The flight control surfaces and wing flaps remained attached to the airframe. The landing gear was in the extended position when observed at the accident site. The forward fuselage and wings were oriented on an approximate magnetic heading of 030 degrees; the aft fuselage and empennage were oriented on an approximate magnetic heading of 005 degrees.FAA records indicated that the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with single engine land, multi-engine land, and instrument airplane ratings. The certificate included type ratings for CE-500 and LR-Jet airplanes. The pilot also held a flight instructor certificate with single, multi-engine, and instrument airplane ratings. He was issued a first class airman medical certificate with a restriction for corrective lenses on November 12, 2014. On the medical certificate application, the pilot reported a total flight time of 1,374 hours, with 303 hours flown within the preceding 6 months.",

He did not visually check the fuel tanks prior to take off and he could not recall what the fuel gauges indicated during the flight.  However, he thought that both auxiliary fuel tanks were full, and both main fuel tanks were almost full.

Just southeast of Pagosa Springs, the airplane turned toward the southwest.  Approximately 5 minutes later, the airplane resumed a west-northwesterly course toward the Telluride area.   Approximately 25 miles south of the Telluride Regional Airport, the airplane made a turn to the north.  The airplane had descended to 15,000 feet.  One minute later, radar showed the airplane in a 600 foot-per-minute descent that eventually took the airplane below 14,000 feet.   Approximately 12 miles south of the airport, the airplane turned to the west-northwest.  The airplane was at 13,900 feet  on a course toward Wilson Peak and the Lizard Head Pass area.  Approximately 3 miles southeast of Wilson Peak (elevation 14,246 feet), radar showed the airplane enter a 2,000 foot-per-minute descent.  The airplane's groundspeed increased from 149 to 260 knots.  The airplane leveled off momentarily at 13,400 feet and then entered a 2,000 foot-per-minute climb.  The airplane's groundspeed was 191 knots.  Approximately 12 seconds later, radar contact with the airplane was lost.  At last contact, the airplane was at 13,500 feet and within 1 mile of the southeast face of Wilson Peak.  Rescue teams located the airplane near the summit of Wilson Peak the following day.  Airplane wreckage was located on all sides of the mountain.  An examination of the wreckage at the scene showed no pre-impact anomalies.  A meteorological study of weather conditions around Wilson Peak at the time of the accident indicated the potential for severe turbulence and rotors.        ",

The right-side inboard and outboard generators passed all manufacturers specifications.  The left-side generators were disassembled.  The inspection did not reveal any anomalies.  A slight difference in the brush wear between the brush fittings was noted between the two generators.  A short circuit between two adjacent collectors was found in the outboard generator rotor fitting.

The pilot and passenger were not injured.  The pilot reported that he entered the traffic pattern for runway 18 at the intended destination.  He noted that the wind conditions were determined from a windsock prior to landing.  The windsock indicated that the wind was directly from the west.  The pilot stated:  \"The air was relatively smooth until turning to final at which point it became increasingly turbulent as I descended.  On final approach I was applying right aileron and full left rudder to maintain alignment with the runway centerline.  On initial touchdown the plane 'skipped' slightly and at that moment I believe a strong gust of wind from the west/northwest lifted the right wing.

Forecast weather conditions along the route of flight called for areas of mountain obscuration and precipitation, including snow. The pilot filed an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, and he was issued an IFR clearance. About 44 minutes into the flight, the pilot canceled the IFR clearance and continued the flight under visual flight rules (VFR). About 16 minutes later, the pilot amended the flight\u2019s destination to an airport that was along the route of flight, but closer than the original destination, and about 19 minutes after that, the air traffic controller told the pilot that radar service was terminated. About 1.5 hours after radar service was terminated, the airplane impacted mountainous terrain at an elevation of about 6,400 feet mean sea level (msl). The wreckage was confined to the impact area, and the damage was consistent with controlled flight into terrain. The accident site was located along the route of flight beyond the amended destination and about 20 miles short of the original destination, indicating that the pilot had over flown the amended destination and may have been attempting to reach the original destination. About 30 minutes before the accident, light rain and mountain top obscuration were reported in the vicinity of the original destination airport. At the time of the accident, the original destination airport was reporting cloud layers with bases about 6,300 and 6,800 feet msl. Given the forecast and reported weather conditions, it is likely that the pilot encountered IMC and was unable to see the terrain prior to the airplane colliding with it. The toxicology report for the pilot showed positive results for amphetamine, methamphetamine, and trimethoprim, an antibiotic used to treat infections. However, it could not be determined from available samples when the amphetamine and methamphetamine had been ingested, and, therefore, whether they would have impaired the pilot\u2019s performance. Review of the pilot's medical records indicated that he had diabetes, and, one day prior to the accident, he had been treated for a skin infection.

The certified private pilot was killed. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot. No flight plan was filed for the flight that originated at Winchester Municipal Airport (BGF), Winchester, Tennessee, about 1430 central daylight time. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.Personnel based at Winchester Airport reported seeing the airplane depart around 1430. Radar coverage for the accident area was weak; however, a target was observed traveling westbound from the airport toward the location of where the accident occurred. The target was first observed at 1430 at an altitude of 3,300 feet about 11 miles west of the airport. The target proceeded west-northwest until the data stopped about 1.9 miles east of the accident site at 1433.  At that time, the target was at an altitude of 2,895 feet. The airplane collided with trees and terrain on a cattle farm. There were no witnesses to the accident and the airplane wreckage was located the flowing morning by a ranch-hand at 0822.An on-scene examination was conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board Investigator-in-Charge (NTSB IIC) on May 5, 2015. The airplane collided with a stand of 70-foot-tall hackberry trees with its right wing tip before it impacted the ground, another stand of hackberry trees and four cows. The airplane then traveled a short distance and came to rest in a cattle pond. All major components of the airplane were located at the accident site and there was no evidence of in-flight or post-impact fire.Both wings sustained extensive impact damage and separated from the airframe in two sections. These sections of  the wings came to rest near the base of the second stand of hackberry trees. This was also the area where the cattle were located. The right wing tip exhibited more aft crushing to the leading edge than the left wing. The main wreckage, which consisted of the cockpit, fuselage, empennage and tail control surfaces came to rest in the shallow cattle pond. The engine had separated from the firewall. The main wreckage sustained extensive impact damage.The cattle pond was drained and the wreckage was removed and taken to a salvage facility where a layout examination was conducted on May 6, 2015.Examination of the airplane confirmed flight control continuity for all major flight control surfaces from the control surface to the cockpit. The elevator trim tab actuator was overextended from impact forces and the flap actuator was in the fully retracted position. Both fuel caps for each wing were in place and secure to their respective fuel ports. Numerous breaks in the fuel system between the engine and fuel tanks were observed due to impact.  The fuel selector was in the \"both\" position. The gascolator remained attached to the firewall and was disassembled. The bowl had some water and sediment from the cattle pond and the fuel screen was absent of debris.No mechanical anomalies were noted with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation at the time of the accident.The engine sustained impact damage, with more of the damage being concentrated on the right side. The right side cylinders were crushed and the push rods and rocker arms were distorted.  As a result, the engine could not be rotated more than 45 degrees. However, when the engine was rotated, continuity to the accessory gears was observed. The oil sump was pushed up into the bottom of the engine.  It was removed so the camshaft could be exposed.  The camshaft was intact and no mechanical anomalies were noted. Both magnetos had separated from the accessory case. They were water-soaked and spark could not be produced at the terminals; however, both units were disassembled and no mechanical anomalies were noted. The oil filter remained attached to the engine.  It was removed and opened to expose the filter.  The filter was absent of any debris.The propeller governor also remained on the engine.  It was removed and disassembled.  No anomalies were noted.The spark plugs were removed and exhibited normal wear.Examination of the carburetor revealed the throttle/mixture lever and actuator pump moved freely.The 2-bladed propeller had separated from the engine and was found near the wing sections. Both blades were loose in the hub. One blade exhibited leading edge and front face gouging and scoring. The blade was bent aft and was curled at the tip. There were nicks in the trailing edge as well. The second blade exhibited front-face and leading edge polishing, and was bent aft. A section of the blade-tip was missing.No mechanical anomalies were noted with the engine that would have precluded normal operation at the time of the accident.A handheld GPS was located in the wreckage and was sent to the NTSB Recorder Laboratory in Washington DC for further evaluation.The pilot held a private pilot certificate for airplane single-engine land, and instrument airplane.

The airplane impacted a wooded area in a 20-degree nose down trajectory and came to rest about 142 feet from the initial impact point.  The pilot reported smoke in the cockpit 55 seconds after takeoff which was then followed by a report of a fire 32 seconds later.  A witness reported seeing gray and black smoke trailing from the right side of the exhaust area.  Inspection of the wreckage revealed that the turbocharger exhaust V-band clamp was separated through the band.  Metallurgical examination indicated that the separation was consistent with a fatigue fracture.  According to maintenance records, the V-band clamp was installed in 1990 in response to a service letter (SL).  An airworthiness directive (AD) was then issued in 1991 requiring the replacement of the V-band clamp with one which was of the same part number as called for by the SL.  The V-band clamp found in the wreckage of the accident airplane was of the same part number required by the SL and AD.  The airplane received an annual inspection 25 days prior to the accident at which time the V-band clamp would have accumulated a total time in service of 1,402 hours.  Engine overhauls and exhaust system related maintenance has necessitated the clamp's repeated removal and installation since its original installation.

Witnesses observed the tandem-seat airplane make a \"sharp turn to the left\", \"stall,\" impact terrain and catch fire.  During the brief flight, witnesses heard a surging noise.  The airplane had never been flown before and had been issued an experimental airworthiness certificate two months prior to the accident.  According to people at the airport, the front seat pilot had been working on the airplane for over a year and had never flown it.  They added that the propeller governor had been removed and reinstalled a few days prior to the accident.  The rear seat pilot stated that it was his understanding that the airplane was not supposed to takeoff.  Toxicology tests on the front seat pilot revealed 0.05 ug/ml of diphenhydramine in the pilot's blood, an unquantified amount of diphenhydramine in the liver, and 1.076 ug/ml of acetaminophen in the pilot's blood.  Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter pain reliever commonly known by the trade name Tylenol.  Diphenhydramine is an over-the-counter antihistamine.  A study on the effects of diphenhydramine on driving performance revealed that the drug significantly impaired a person's ability to maneuver an automobile.  Examination of the propeller governor revealed that the booster pump drive shaft was coated with what appeared to be a cooked oil coating, and the pilot valve was sticking inside the booster pump drive shaft.  It could not be determined if the cooked oil coating was a result of the post crash fire or a pre-existing condition.",

The pilot verified that he had rudder control and noticed that the upper left rudder pedal seemed displaced forward of its normal position. He further noticed that the left rudder pedal was binding at various times, but overall was operational, and thus suspected that the left brake master cylinder had disconnected from the rudder pedal. The pilot said that every time he applied left rudder during the landing the airplane veered to the left as if left brake was being applied. Despite his control inputs, the airplane exited the left side of the runway and nosed over within the soft muddy terrain, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the left brake master cylinder was separated from the left rudder pedal at the rudder attach point. Examination of the left rudder pedal and master cylinder revealed that the left rudder pedal was fractured at the lug where it attached to the upper end of the brake master cylinder. The fracture surface was consistent with an overstress fracture.

He indicated that there was no mechanical malfunction with the aircraft's power plant or systems.  However, in his written report, he stated that on short final he 'scanned the instrument panel and noticed the airspeed read 100 mph.  (This is way too high to stop a Long EZ on a 4000' runway.)  Aircraft attitude seemed normal, approach was at appropriate altitude/lineup, so I reduced power and deployed the speed brake.  In my aircraft, the speed brake blows closed at 95 mph from aerodynamic forces-it stayed out.  As I mentally started processing the fact that the speed brake did not blow back, I sensed an increase in the rate of descent.  I retracted the speed brake, added full power, and eased the nose up-touching down 250' short of the runway.'

The pilot and three passengers received fatal injuries. One passenger received serious injuries. The aircraft was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was not on a flight plan. The flight was originating at the time of the accident and the final destination was the Provo Municipal Airport, Provo, Utah.The brother of the pilot was a witness to the accident. He stated that he saw the airplane taxi to the north end of the 2,000 foot long grass runway where it turned around for a takeoff to the south. He said that the airplane lifted off and then began a right turn toward an opening in the tree line at the departure end of the runway. The airplane then pitched up abruptly, rolled to the left and dove into the ground.The airplane came to rest about 100 feet west of the south end of the private 2,000 foot long grass runway. The runway in the takeoff direction, south, had a slight uphill slope and trees about 70 feet tall at the departure end. The north end of the runway had no obstructions and the ground sloped downward into a valley after the runway end. The airplane came to rest in an inverted position with the nose of the airplane pointing approximately 150 degrees magnetic. The entire cabin section of the airplane and the majority of the left wing were consumed by a post crash fire. The right wing was predominately intact with fire damage to the inboard end and crush damage along the length of the wing. The lower fuselage skin had separated at the aft edge exposing the internal wing structure. The majority of the wreckage was contained within the immediate vicinity of the main wreckage. The propeller was found with the initial impact crater with all three blades still attached to the hub. All three blades exhibited varying amounts of leading edge gouging and chordwise scratching. The crankshaft flange remained attached to the propeller hub, but had separated from the remainder of the engine crankshaft. The position of the propeller indicated a near vertical impact. Impact scars for both wings were also observed. Based on the takeoff direction, the airplane had rolled to an inverted attitude prior to impact.The tail surfaces remained intact with little damage. The damage consisted to bending and crumpling of the top of the vertical stabilizer. The rudder and elevator control cables were intact from the tail surfaces to their forward mounting positions. Due to the extensive fire damage the aluminum control components within the cabin had melted. The elevator trim cable was intact except for a separated link at the sprocket in the cockpit. The aileron balance cable was intact from the right aileron bellcrank to the left attachment point of the cable. The left bellcrank was consumed by the fire. The left aileron control cable was intact from connection point at the aileron bellcrank to the other connection point within the cabin. The right aileron control cable was intact from the right aileron bellcrank to the cabin area where the opposite end was broken. The remaining portion of the cable was not located. The broken end exhibited signatures consistent with overload failure. Both flap controlactuators were melted and consumed by fire. Determination of the flap position was not possible.The airplanes engine had broken loose from its mounts during the impact sequence.

The crew initiated their descent at a 'later than normal distance' from the airport, and as a result, a power reduction below 25 percent torque was required, which set off the gear warning horn.  The sound 'eventually became part of the background noise.'  During the approach, the captain asked the tower to dim the runway lights.  At that time, the runway and approach lights went out and the crew lost sight of the runway.  While the captain was asking the tower to turn the lights back on, the first officer called 'gear down, syncs off, speeds high, below the line check list.'  The captain did not hear the first officer's callout and did not lower the landing gear.  The captain stated that he did not hear the first officer's callout 'either because of the conversation [he] was having with the tower or because of the intercom system difficulties.'  As the approach continued, the first officer had a problem slowing the airplane to proper approach speed.

Review of radar data showed the airplane departing and then proceeding on a northeasterly heading toward the intended destination. For the first 35 minutes of flight, the airplane remained below 10,000 ft mean sea level (msl). The airplane then ascended to a maximum altitude of 17,000 ft msl, initiated a descent, and turned north. As the airplane continued to descend through 14,300 ft msl, it turned west. (The airplane operated above 10,000 ft msl for 1 hour 8 minutes.) The data then showed the airplane perform a series of 360-degree descending turns. During the series of turns, the airplane descended to 6,200 ft msl and then ascended while turning east. The last recorded radar target was located about 12 miles west of the accident site at an altitude of 9,800 ft msl. Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted mountainous terrain just below the top of a ridgeline at an altitude of about 10,679 ft msl. \u000b\u000bAirmen\u2019s meteorological information for instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), mountain obscuration, and moderate turbulence conditions below 18,000 ft were in effect throughout the area about the time of the accident. Satellite imagery depicted a layer of low clouds over the area with a thick, overcast layer of clouds over the accident site. Weather radar imagery depicted scattered echoes within the immediate vicinity of the accident site, which indicates that precipitation was falling over the area. However, due to the possibility of beam blockage from the higher terrain, the full extent and intensity of the precipitation over the accident site could not be determined. It could not be determined if the pilot obtained a weather briefing before the flight. \u000b\u000bA postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Wreckage impact signatures and radar data were consistent with continued flight toward the intended destination before the accident. It is likely that the pilot was attempting to maneuver around the IMC but did not maintain situational awareness and sufficient altitude above the mountainous terrain and entered IMC at the time of the accident.\u000b\u000bAs noted, the airplane operated 1 hour 8 minutes over 10,000 ft msl; this included 42 minutes over 14,000 ft msl. The Federal Aviation Administration requires pilots to use supplemental oxygen when flying over 14,000 ft msl; however, no evidence was found that supplemental oxygen was available to or used by the pilot. The duration of flight at these altitudes without supplemental oxygen could have resulted in the pilot experiencing hypoxia, which can cause various symptoms, including headache, decreased reaction time, impaired judgment, euphoria, visual impairment, and drowsiness. The pilot\u2019s decision-making was likely significantly impaired during this period, and the radar track showed that the airplane turned away from and flew northwest beyond the intended destination. However, the data then showed the airplane descend and remain below 10,000 ft msl for the last 17 minutes of recorded data as the flight track changed direction back toward the original destination. During this period, it is likely that the symptoms of hypoxia would have largely abated. \u000b",

No other anomalies were found that would have precluded the engine from normal operation.  An examination of the fuel servo revealed that the unit had a black coloration in the throat section and blue staining present near the idle valve.

The examination of the fan blade revealed it had fractured from a fatigue crack that had initiated at the intersection of the convex side aft corner of the shear key slot and bedding flank.  The examination of the fan blade also revealed the plasma spray coating was deteriorated and the dry film lubricant was almost completely gone.  A survey by the engine manufacturer of the operator's 777 engine usage indicated that because of the loads and lengths of the flights, the operator was operating their Trent 895-17 engines at higher thrust levels with correspondingly high fan rotational speeds, which were still within the engine's operating limits, than any other operator.  The survey also indicated the operator was operating its 777 and Trent engines significantly more hours per cycle than any other Trent 895 operator.  An analysis by the engine manufacturer indicated that the blade fracture was caused by a combination of the breakdown of the lubrication system and residual fatigue life usage in the blade root following the last overhaul coupled with the high operating stresses in the fan blade from the high thrust settings.",

The duration of the flight was about 3 hours and 47 minutes.  The POH listed the airplane fuel capacity was 72 gallons of useable fuel.

He performed an emergency descent by pulling the top out of the envelope and subsequently, the balloon landed hard. During the landing, three passengers were injured, and the envelope snagged on several trees resulting in substantial damage to the envelope. According to the pilot, at the time of the landing, each of the three 20-gallon fuel tanks was approximately 15 to 20 percent full. A balloon repair station owner reported that burner utilization during flight is either FULL on or totally off (except for the pilot light). When the fuel level of a tank is between approximately 10 to 20 percent, the liquid propane will begin to cavitate in a vortex manner due to the rapid evacuation of fuel through the fuel tank's liquid dip tube, which supplies each respective burner via a fuel hose. When this occurs, there is a discernible difference in the sound of a burner, a pulsing woof-woof, and the power output/thermal output is dramatically reduced.

The blade grip had been inspected about 109 flight hours before in accordance with AD 2003-01-04, which specified an inspection interval of 150 flight hours.  The blade grip was sent to the manufacturers laboratory in Ft Worth, Texas for examination. Along with the cracked part, several inspection methods were reviewed.  The procedures review showed that the blade grip had not been inspected in accordance with AD 2003-01-04, nor the manufacturers approved procedures.

The collision occurred about one and one-half miles northeast of the airport.  Both aircraft were under the control of a developmental air traffic controller who was being supervised by a certified controller.  The Cessna pilot contacted the tower controller and was instructed to enter a right downwind via the forty-five.  The controller advised, \"...traffic ahead and to your right, one thousand six hundred, turning southbound, type unknown.\"  The pilot did not respond.  About 15 seconds later the pilot of another DHC-2 Beaver, N715JR, contacted the controller and was advised that the Cessna was passing behind him, was no factor, and to enter right downwind for runway 33.  The pilot acknowledged.  Approximately 20 seconds later the pilot of the accident DHC-2 Beaver made his initial contact with the controller, who replied, \"\u2026ok, you have traffic twelve o'clock, two miles, a Cessna, one thousand three hundred southbound.\"  The pilot advised he was looking for the traffic.  About 17 seconds passed when the controller instructed the pilot of the accident DHC-2 Beaver, \"\u2026enter downwind via the 45, you'll be following that Cessna ahead and to your right.\"  The pilot responded, \"Ok, we'll be landing on the water,\" and the controller replied, \"Roger that, he's landing on the hard surface, you'll be doing a low approach over the water, understand.\"  About 40 seconds passed, when the controller asked the pilot of the accident DHC-2 Beaver if he had the Cessna in sight, to which the pilot replied, \"\u2026ah, we've got an aircraft on downwind ahead of us in sight,\" with the controller acknowledging, \"roger, follow that aircraft.\"  The pilot acknowledged, stating later in his statement, \"The Beaver ahead of me was given clearance to proceed as requested.  I informed the tower that I had the traffic ahead and on downwind in sight and was told to follow him.\"  About five seconds later the pilot of the other DHC-2 Beaver reported entering downwind and would be landing on the water, and approximately 30 seconds later the controller instructed the Cessna to proceed direct to the downwind.

In addition, both wings and the horizontal stabilizer were removable. The pilot, who was also a mechanic, disassembled the airplane for storage during the winter. He subsequently reassembled it and completed a condition inspection. He then flew the airplane to an airport where a ballistic parachute system was installed. The pilot then flew the airplane to another airport and, the next day, departed on the accident flight with the intention of delivering the airplane to its owner.About 20 minutes after takeoff, the airplane experienced a disconnected elevator, and the pilot attempted to fly to a nearby airport. The airplane was about 50 feet above the ground when it entered a sudden steep pitch downward and impacted the ground about 60 feet before the runway.The airplane's flight controls were actuated by a series of push-pull rods. The respective push-pull rods for the left and right ailerons and elevator controls featured a \"quick-fastener\" to disconnect and reconnect the respective flight control.

Disassembly of the model 211CC vacuum pump revealed the following.  A number was assigned to each of the rotor segments and the corresponding vanes were marked and removed from their respective slots.  Five of the six vanes were intact, and vane #4 was broken.  Four pieces were reassembled to recreate approximately 80 percent of vane #4.  Three of the four pieces were found in the mounting flange, and one piece was found in the back flange.  The rotor segments were marked such that vane slot #4 is between segment 4 and segment 5.  Upon examination of the walls of vane slot 4, a groove approximately .450 inches by .120 inches by .020 inches deep was found on both sides of the vane slot.  These grooves corresponded in dimension and position to the portion of the vane that was missing.  Three carbon pieces were found, which exhibited extensive wear, which, in two cases, were smooth and round like a \"BB.\"  The rear fracture surface of vane #4 exhibited a smooth, polished, spherical wear mark corresponding with the carbon pieces found.  The pump housing had severe wear such that there were washboard marks around its entire circumference.  At the bottom of the bore, a burr was found on the edge of one of the back flange discharge ports.  Corresponding rotational marks were found on the pump's rotor.  According to Parker Hannifin, the rule of thumb for vane wear versus service life is:  .025-inches of wear for every 100 hours of operation.  Using Parker's original new vane length of .845 inches, the estimated time of operation of the vanes of the accident pump was approximately 1,380 hours.  According to Parker the vacuum pump had been overhauled.  Parker's service letters require replacement of model 211CC vacuum pumps after 500 hours of operation or 6 years from the date of manufacture, which ever occurs first.  Examination of the directional gyro revealed that the housing was intact and the gyro was free to move.  No rotational marks were found on the gyro or inside the housing.  The turn coordinator gyro was examined and no rotational scoring was found when removed from the housing.  A small portion of the housing was fractured and missing.  The attitude indicator gyro was free to move within its housing and the housing was intact.  No rotational scoring was noted when the gyro was removed from the housing.  The filament of the vacuum enunciator bulb # PL33[0] exhibited stretching.",
            "probable_cause": "The total failure of the vacuum pump that resulted in an inoperative attitude gyro and spatial disorientation and a subsequent loss of aircraft control by the pilot.  Factors were; the prevailing instrument meteorological conditions, and the dark night light condition."
