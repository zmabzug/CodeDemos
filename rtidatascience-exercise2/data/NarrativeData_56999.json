It was the first flight of the day for the pilot and airplane, and his first flight in this particular airplane. Because the airport elevation was about 5,100 feet above mean sea level, the pilot leaned the fuel-air mixture, then conducted an engine run-up. The pilot reported that the run-up was normal and that he set flaps at 5 degrees. The target climb speed was 80 mph. The initial portion of the takeoff roll was normal but then seemed to continue for an \u201cabnormal length of runway.\u201d The pilot did not abort the takeoff because, by the time he recognized that the airplane was not performing adequately, he believed that there was insufficient runway remaining to stop. The airplane lifted off, but then the engine seemed to experience a partial loss of power, and the pilot was unable to fly the airplane out of ground effect after it crossed the departure end of the runway. The pilot jettisoned the payload and conducted a precautionary landing in a field off the end of the runway to avoid a collision with power lines. Review of maintenance records found that the engine exceeded the recommended time between overhaul by 470 hours. However, examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The appearance of the engine spark plugs was consistent with the engine being regularly operated with a fuel-air mixture that was leaner than normal, and the possibility that the pilot improperly leaned the engine for the takeoff could not be ruled out. The takeoff performance data in the airplane manufacturer's operating manual was insufficient to determine the expected performance for the airplane\u2019s reported configuration and ambient conditions. The available performance data suggested that the airplane should have been able to climb out of ground effect and that the target climb speed used by the pilot might have been too high; however, the available information was inconclusive with regard to both these issues.",

The forecast was for widely scattered rain showers with low ceilings and visibility.  After contacting Denver Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) and requesting that his flight plan be activated, the briefer asked the pilot if he had received the forecasted AIRMETs.  The pilot acknowledged that he had.  The pilot's brother, who lived in the accident area, observed the deteriorating weather.  He called the departure airport to advise the pilot to delay the flight, and was told that they had already departed.  The aircraft became the subject of an ALNOT when it failed to arrive at its destination.  On the evening of May 4, the airplane was located along the east side of Pagosa Peak at the 11,000 foot level.

Witnesses reported the engine losing power during takeoff and the airplane entered a sharp right bank.  The airplane then collided with obstacles and terrain.  Post accident examination of the engine showed that debris coated the inlet side of the fuel manifold valve which is separated from the outlet side by a screen.  When fuel enters the manifold valve, it comes through the screen, and eventually out to the fuel injector nozzles.  Due to the amount of debris on the inlet side of the manifold valve, injector fuel pressure could not be obtained above 213 psi (specifications were for 250 psi).  With the fuel pump pressure at 83 psi (specifications were for 32.5 psi), at RPMs above 1,500, the fuel pressure may have been excessive, dependent upon the distribution of the debris within the valve.  An aviation maintenance technician and a family member reported that the pilot had been experiencing engine trouble during takeoff, similar to the circumstances surrounding the accident, and to correct the problem he would adjust the mixture setting.  This adjustment was most likely due to the excessive fuel pressure at the pump, set as a result of the low fuel pressures due to the contaminated manifold valve.  As the system pressure increased, the debris generally limited the fuel flow pressure.  However, because the debris could move within the valve, the pilot most likely experienced erratic fuel flow pressures.

The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to Gibbs Rentals Inc. and operated by a private individual as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the planned flight to TIX. The flight originated from Orlando Executive Airport (ORL), Orlando, Florida, about 1540.According to preliminary information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the flight was in radio and radar contact with air traffic control (ATC) as the pilot was performing an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 36 at TIX. The pilot subsequently reported to ATC that he was performing a missed approach and ATC advised the pilot to fly the published missed approach procedure and switch radio frequency to Orlando departure frequency. The pilot started to make a right turn; however, the published missed approach for the ILS runway 36 was to climb to 500 feet and then start a climbing left turn to 2,000 feet. The Orlando departure controller asked the pilot if he wanted the published missed approach or to fly south and get out of the storm. The pilot stated he wanted to turn south and the controller then advised the pilot to turn right when able to a heading of 210 degrees. No further communications were received from the accident airplane. During the missed approach, the airplane climbed to approximately 1100 feet mean sea level (msl), then dropped rapidly to 300 feet msl, before radar contact was lost.The wreckage was subsequently located about 2 miles east of TIX, submerged in the Indian River in about 6 feet of water. The debris field was compact and both engines were located about 40 feet apart. About 50 percent of the airplane was recovered and most pieces were 2 feet by 2 feet or smaller. Components recovered included sections of the nosecone, seats, left wing spar, empennage and horizontal stabilizer, and both wing baggage compartment doors. Due to the lack of cables and controls recovered, flight control continuity could not be verified. Measurement of the elevator trim actuator corresponded to an off-scale nose-up trim, consistent with impact damage.The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, airplane multiengine land, and instrument airplane. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on August 23, 2013. At that time, he reported a total flight experience of 976 hours.The recorded weather at TIX, at 1650, included winds from 070 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 22 knots, visibility 3 miles with thunderstorms and rain showers, temperature 23 degrees C, dew point 22 degrees C; barometric altimeter 29.94 inches of mercury.The engines were retained for further examination.",

Each time, he requested an abbreviated weather briefing and was told of embedded thunderstorms and convective activity along the route of flight. He was also told that there was a tornado watch in effect for central and southern Florida. After amending the instrument-flight-rules flight plan takeoff time three times, the flight was cleared to take off from runway 36 at 1730. After takeoff the flight was handed off to Jacksonville Center (ZJX) and the controller provided information on the moderate and heavy precipitation along the pilot's route of flight for the next 100 miles. The pilot requested deviation of \"any holes\" left or right of the flight path. The controller informed him that the moderate to heavy precipitation was to the left and right of them for 200 miles. About 10 minutes after the initial contact with the controller, the pilot asked \"How much further does it look for us?...Getting bumped around pretty bad here.\" The ZJX controller advised that they were in moderate precipitation for the next 30 miles and briefed them on what to expect for the next several miles; the pilot acknowledged the transmission. After about 5 minutes, the controller informed the pilot that they were in a patch with no precipitation and again briefed him on what to expect for the remainder of the flight; the pilot never acknowledged the transmission and no further transmissions were received. About 30 seconds later, with the flight over the Gulf of Mexico and on a southeast heading at approximately 5,000 feet msl, radar contact was lost. Prior to the loss of contact radar returns show that the airplane began a right descending turn. At that time, satellite weather imagery depicted a line of clouds along a front and over the last radar hit consisting of nimbostratus to embedded cumulonimbus clouds with level 3 to 4 intensity echoes. The airplane was most likely not equipped with any airborne weather detection and avoidance systems.

He stated his intention to file an IFR flight plan from Morristown, NJ to Bedford, MA, at 5000 feet and requested a standard weather briefing. The briefer provided info from AIRMET Zule, Update 1, that the freezing level was at 10,000 feet, but said '...the freezing level up around Boston is at 5,000 feet, so anything 5 and above you might pick up icing there.'  The pilot filed for 7,000 feet. At 0945 edt, after the pilot had received his weather briefing, AIRMET Zulu, Update 2 was issued, which called for light occasional moderate rime and mixed icing in the clouds and precipitation. Also, it cautioned that the freezing level would be from the surface to 4,000 feet, north of the pilot's destination, sloping to 8,000 feet at his departure point. At 1035, the pilot took off. About 30 minutes later, the airplane's single turbine engine experienced a completed loss of power. The airplane then descended in IMC and collided with trees during a forced landing. Examination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact failure of the engine, airframe, fuel system, or propeller. Investigation revealed N450T was not certifcated for flight in known icing conditions, and that the pilot did not use all anti-ice and deicing equipment as specified by the operator's manual.

The bog was about 15 to 20 feet deep, with a thin layer of vegetation floating on the surface.  The airplane came to rest inverted, and damage to the airframe was consistent with an inverted impact to the surface of the bog.  Data recovered from the airplane's flight display system indicated that the airplane was in stable flight on a 320-degree magnetic heading, at 4,500 feet msl, and approximately 160 knots true airspeed prior to the accident, when it abruptly departed from controlled flight.

The pilot was participating in a mountain flying seminar and was flying with a CFI.  The purpose of the flight was instructional in nature intending to practice short canyon turns.  They flew the first canyon at 300 feet agl, 70 mph, 20 degrees of flaps, along the south side of the canyon, and rode a few thermals.  Identifying areas where thermal lift could be found was part of the instructional flight.   He then crossed into another canyon that was full of burned out terrain and dead fall trees.  This canyon he flew at 300 to 350 feet agl, 60 to 65 mph, and full flaps.  The pilot angled his plane towards a rock cliff expecting to pickup thermal lift from the warm rocks.  He flew with the wing tip about 10 feet from the cliff.  The climb stopped, the airspeed fell off, and the wing stalled.  He turned left, applied full throttle, and lowered the nose of the airplane.  The descent was rapid as he tried to direct the airplane between deadfall trees into a drainage gully.  The airplane's descent continued and he tried to land the airplane as gently as he could.

Several witnesses observed the three airplanes flying from west to east in trailing formation, each slightly lower than the one in front. The first two airplanes in the formation performed a barrel roll. The third airplane, which was being flown by the private pilot, then entered a barrel roll; however the nose of the airplane \u201cdropped\u201d into an extremely low attitude as it came through the inverted arc of the roll. The roll then stopped, but the airplane was almost full nose-down in a vertical descent. The airplane then appeared to immediately begin pitching up, and the airplane\u2019s pitch attitude decreased to about 45 degrees nose-low. The pitch attitude continued to decrease, but the airplane began to oscillate rapidly about the roll and pitch axis. A few seconds later, the airplane\u2019s heading changed about 180 degrees while the airplane continued descending at a 30- to 45-degree nose-low attitude and continued to oscillate about the roll and pitch axis until it was lost from sight behind. The sound of impact was then heard and smoke rose from behind the trees. \u000b\u000bExamination of the accident site, airplane, and engine, did not reveal any evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction that would have prevented normal operation of the airplane. \u000b\u000bDuring a barrel roll maneuver, it is critical to raise the nose high enough during the first 45 degrees of turn. Not doing so could result in a corresponding nose-low attitude and proportionally high airspeed when recovery is made. Insufficient back pressure could then result in a \u201cdish out\u201d (the airplane falling out of the maneuver) during the inverted portion of the roll.\u000b\u000bThe pilot of the accident airplane was an experienced aerobatic pilot, but the co-owner of the airplane advised that, like all such pilots, he got rusty after long periods of inactivity. A few weeks before the accident, the pilot had commented to the co-owner that he would like for him to ride in the back cockpit and help him \u201cbrush up\u201d on his barrel rolls. The co-owner agreed to ride with him, but they did not set aside a specific time to do that, and it was never accomplished. During the formation sortie, at first the accident pilot\u2019s rolls were crisp and tight, but the pilot fell farther and farther behind and his rolls were getting slower. The airplane\u2019s co-owner observed that the final barrel roll \u201cdished out very badly\u201d (the airplane fell out of the maneuver), which resulted in an extremely nose-low attitude followed by an accelerated stall. It is likely that the pilot recognized his position in relationship to the ground and aggressively applied aft stick in an effort to recover from the nose-low attitude, which resulted in the stall.\u000b\u000bOn the day of the accident, the pilot had flown several formation sorties. The day was hot, and the formation activities were demanding. The accident flight was relatively long, and the co-owner of the airplane guessed it was about 45 minutes long. Most formation sorties were 30 minutes or less. The accident pilot was in his early 70s and was by far the oldest member of the flight. Due to the pilot\u2019s age, the demanding schedule, and the length of the formation sorties, fatigue could have been a factor, although it could not be conclusively determined. \u000b",

The FAA transcript of communications showed that on November 22, 2001, at 1025, shortly after departing from Wilson Industrial Air Center, Wilson, North Carolina, the pilot had initiated radio communications with Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (AFB) Approach Control.   As the flight progressed, communications control had been passed from Seymour Johnson Approach Control, to Fayetteville Approach Control,  to Myrtle Beach Approach Control, to Charleston Approach Control. At 1223, the pilot  was handed off from Charleston Approach Control to Beaufort  Approach Control, and at 1224, the pilot had checked in with Beaufort approach controller, saying that he was at 8,800 feet, and climbing. He then requested to climb to 10,500 feet, to remain clear of clouds, and was given clearance to do so. At 1238, the pilot stated that he had been trying to get above the clouds nice Charleston, and that he was presently at 10,500 feet, and asked if there were any reports on the cloud coverage. He also said that at that time the clouds appeared to be at 10,300 feet. At 1248, the pilot  was instructed to contact Jacksonville Center on 126.75 mHZ, and he acknowledged the frequency change. At 1249, the pilot made initial contact with the Jacksonville Center Brunswick radar sector controller, reporting that he was at 10,300 feet. The controller responded with the Brunswick altimeter setting, and informed the pilot to remain VFR at all times. The pilot did not respond. Radar data showed that at 1248,  the airplane was at an altitude of 10,700 feet, and at 1250, when the airplane was last seen on radar, it had descended to an altitude of 7000 feet, and was in geographic position 32 degrees 06 minutes 58 seconds north latitude, 080 degrees 23 minutes 13 seconds  west longitude There were no subsequent radar contacts or voice communications with the flight. According to information obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard, at 1347, the U.S. Coast Guard received initial notification of the downed airplane and diverted a search and rescue asset to initiate a search. On November 23, 2001, about 0758, a U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue asset observed and recovered airplane related debris floating in the Atlantic Ocean, in position 32 degrees, 01.5 minutes north latitude, 080 degrees, 29.4 minutes west longitude. Airplane related debris was also retrieved in the vicinity of Sea Pines, Hilton Head, South Carolina, and the retrieved debris was examined by an FAA licensed aviation mechanic. The examination revealed that the wreckage was consistent with portions of a Mooney M20.

Examination of air traffic control radar data revealed that the airplane never reached a steady cruise state for any significant amount of time, and its ground track varied laterally on several occasions. This variance in altitude and ground track continued until about 17 minutes after takeoff when the airplane entered a right 270-degree turn and impacted the water while traveling downward at about 5,000 feet per minute. Examination of weather radar data and satellite imagery revealed that the tropical wave had produced overcast conditions, embedded thunderstorms with tops near 34,000 feet, heavy rain, and wind of about 47 knots. Correlation of the weather radar data to the airplane's ground track revealed that the non-instrument rated pilot was maneuvering around and through the weather, and that the airplane's position at the time of the accident correlated to the position of a thunderstorm.

The flight instructor assumed control of the airplane and maneuvered it toward a nearby airport, and the pilot receiving instruction initiated an unsuccessful restart of the engine. After determining that the airplane was not going to reach the airport, the flight instructor executed a forced landing to a road, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and firewall.Examination of the engine crankshaft revealed that it had fractured at the No. 2 main bearing journal; the fracture surface exhibited evidence consistent with fatigue crack propagation. The adjacent bearing materials had deformed and disintegrated. The failure of these components likely preceded the final fracture of the crankshaft. The bearing components from this section were generally too damaged to conclude the mode of failure. However, examination of the No. 6 bearing components and connecting rod bearing journal exhibited wear patterns and damage consistent with oil starvation; the oil starvation likely resulted from bearing movement, which can result from inadequate torque on the engine case through bolts. Although the torque values on the through bolts could not be determined, the failure of the engine\u2019s internal components and the oil starvation were consistent with the through bolts not being torqued properly. Further, the damage was also consistent with damage found on another airplane engine that had experienced a crankshaft failure and oil starvation, which was determined to had been caused by the engine through bolts not being properly torqued (NTSB accident number ERA14LA193). A review of maintenance records revealed that maintenance personnel had replaced the Nos. 2, 3, and 6 engine cylinders about 3 months before the accident. It is likely that maintenance personnel did not torque the through bolts in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s specifications during this maintenance and that this led to the eventual fracture of the crankshaft.

They noted no other anomalies and seemed to have full flight control authority. However, as a precaution, the flight crew elected to return and land at the departure airport. The crew reported that the landing was normal with the exception of the required control wheel offset.  A post incident examination of the aileron control system revealed a 360\u00ba fracture in the silver-brazed joint between the drive sprocket and its mating shaft of the left-hand aileron control sprocket assembly.  The failure of the brazed joint allowed both control wheels to be rotated approximately 45 degrees from neutral without a corresponding aileron control surface response.  NTSB metallurgical examination of the left-hand sprocket assembly revealed that it was not brazed according to the referenced specifications. Specifically, the examination noted that the braze filler material had been introduced from both ends of the joint, resulting in a lack of penetration of about 20 percent of the total joint area. The applicable specification states, \"the filler metal shall be introduced at one edge...and shall flow by capillary action to fill the interstice.\"  The NTSB's review of the incident aircraft's maintenance records showed that a flight data recorder (FDR) functional check was completed the night before the incident flight. The roll control parameter, which is designed to measure the aileron surface position, was one of the parameters checked.  To verify the accuracy of this parameter, the left control wheel is rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise until the ailerons contact their respective up or down stops. When the stops are contacted, the control wheel is held in position and the FDR roll control parameter value is checked against an approved maintenance manual limit. The control wheel is then rotated in the opposite direction and the FDR parameter is verified.  The mechanic who conducted the functional check reported that the FDR functional check was routine.  NTSB analysis of available recorded FDR data, incident flight and over 83 flights before the incident flight, showed that the maximum values recorded for the FDR roll control parameter prior to the functional check were 14.6 degrees aileron trailing edge down (TED) and 23.4 degrees aileron trailing edge up (TEU).  The recorded aileron TED value was not in the range required by the approved operators B1900D maintenance inspection procedures document.  The analysis also showed that, during the FDR functional check, the maximum values recorded for the roll parameter exceeded the maximum values recorded prior to the incident by 1.9 degrees in the aileron TED direction and 1.0 degree in the aileron TEU direction. This was the only time that both FDR values for the roll control parameter were in the TED range required by the functional check.  The aircraft manufacturer and the NTSB tested the aileron control system on an exemplar Beechcraft 1900D aircraft in Wichita.  The purpose of the test was to determine the amount of tangential force, applied to the control wheel, required to change the FDR roll control parameter value by 1.9 degrees in the aileron TED direction.  Results of the testing showed that an additional tangential force of 80 pounds applied to the control wheel, after it was rotated such that an aileron was resting against its control surface stop, increased the roll parameter value by 0.7 degrees in the aileron TED direction and 1.3 degrees aileron TEU.  Additional force was not applied to the control wheel because the limit load for the aileron control system is 80.4 pounds.  The airplane manufacturer provided a Beechcraft 1900D Engineering report that documented tests that were conducted on the aileron control system to demonstrate compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations. Test data show that the aileron system did not yield while applying a limit tangential load of 80.4 pounds to the control wheel or fail when an ultimate tangential load of 120.6 pounds was applied to the control wheel.  The aileron control system, including the brazed joint on the sprocket assembly, met all Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness standards for commuter-category aircraft.  The investigation concluded that the failed sprocket assembly significantly reduced the pilots' control of the ailerons because the failure affects pilot input from both control wheels.  ",
            "probable_cause": "Failure of the aileron sprocket assembly at the sprocket-to-shaft braze joint.  Contributing factors were the improper braze procedure used by the part manufacturer at the time of fabrication which resulted in an inferior quality joint and the inadequate quality control (inspection) criteria which failed to identify the improperly brazed joint.  An additional factor was the improper inspection procedure utilized by the operator's maintenance personnel, during which excessive force was applied to the control wheel in order to obtain acceptable flight data recorder readings during the functional check."

On March 16, 2001, the NTSB recommended that the FAA issue an airworthiness directive (AD) to require an initial and recurring inspection of Cessna main landing gear spring steel struts, using nondestructive inspection techniques.  On August 31, 2001, the FAA reported to the NTSB that the current inspection criteria outlined in the Cessna Maintenance Manual are adequate to detect cracks in the main landing gear struts, and that additional airworthiness action is not warranted.  On March 25, 2002, the NTSB responded by stating, in part:  \"The Safety Board continues to believe that a visual inspection alone will not detect cracks in the Cessna main landing gear spring struts.  However, the Safety Board acknowledges that the statistical evidence does not warrant issuance of ADs at this time as called for in the Board's recommendation.\"  The safety recommendation was then classified as: \"Closed-Reconsidered.\"",
            "probable_cause": "A fracture failure of the lower end of the spring steel landing gear strut.  Factors contributing to the accident were the manufacturer's and the FAA's insufficient standards/requirements for inspection procedures."

The helicopter does not have another means of checking fuel quantity except for the fuel gauge in the cockpit.  While en route, the pilot noticed that the fuel gauge needle was \"sticking\", and jumped from 14 gallons down to 7 gallons, which alerted his attention that there was less fuel than originally indicated.  At that point, the helicopter was about 7 miles short of the destination, and the pilot elected to continue.

The pilot performed an autoration, deployed the floats, and landed in shallow water.  Examination of the helicopter revealed the forward boost pump was inoperative, the switch to the forward boost pump caution light did not work, and approximately 6.5 to 7 gallons of fuel were drained from the tank.

As a result, the operator examined their remaining Bell 206B fleet and ensured the forward and aft fuel boost pumps, and both fuel pressure switches operated as required.  All systems operated properly.  In addition, the Before Starting Engine checklist was revised to include a functional test of each fuel boost pump and caution light.",

The flight instructor was fatally injured and the private pilot was seriously injured. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight had departed from the Middle Georgia Regional Airport (MCN), Macon, Georgia.The purpose of the flight was to provide the private pilot with 1 hour of flight experience in the airplane to meet insurance company requirements. A witness stated he watched the airplane as it approached the runway at GA81. When he first noticed the airplane it was \"moving a little up and down, like a boat on waves,\" as if it were \"fighting the wind.\" He said it then pitched steeply upward, and rolled left, then pitched steeply downward and descended near vertically until it impacted the ground. The flight instructor held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single and multiengine land, and instrument airplane. He also held a flight instructor certificate with ratings that included airplane single engine. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) third-class medical certificate was issued on June 2, 2014. He reported 7,350 total hours of flight experience on that date. The private pilot held ratings for airplane single and multiengine land, airplane single engine sea, rotorcraft-helicopter, glider, and instrument airplane. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on November 26, 2013. He reported 1,288 total hours of flight experience on that date. According to FAA airworthiness records the airplane was manufactured in 1946. It's most recent annual inspection was completed on July 1, 2014 at an airframe total time of 2,299 hours, and had accrued 30 additional flight hours since the inspection. The wreckage was examined at the accident site on January 17, 2015 and all major components were accounted for at the scene. The wreckage path was in a field, was oriented 010 degrees magnetic, and was 30 feet in length. Flight control continuity was traced from each of the flight controls to all control surfaces. The airplane was removed from the site, and an examination of the engine completed on January 19, 2015.

Before the accident, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) cableway system had spanned the river about 300 feet north of the wreckage and had been elevated about 39 feet above the river\u2019s center. Examination of the cable, its landing platforms, the helicopter, and the wreckage location revealed evidence consistent with the helicopter impacting the cable while traveling in level-forward flight. A photo of the cableway taken by the USGS before the accident showed that the cable suspended over the river was not visible against the terrain background; however, the cableway did not meet the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aerial marker requirement criteria. The USGS has replaced the cableway with aerial markers. In addition, the accident occurred within a designated Special Conservation Area, which the FAA recommends avoiding, if practical, or if flown through, it recommends that pilots should make every effort to fly not less than 2,000 feet above ground level.The pilot\u2019s postaccident ethanol levels were indicative of the ethanol being produced postmortem; if any of the ethanol was due to ingestion, it was well below the FAA regulatory limit, and it is unlikely to have contributed to the accident. The pilot\u2019s postaccident diphenhydramine level suggests that he had taken it within an hour of taking off. Diphenhydramine causes marked sedation, is a central nervous system depressant, and it has been observed to alter mood and impair cognitive and psychomotor performance.

The witness estimated the airplane to be 100-150 feet above ground level. A second witness reported that the airplane descended into the tree canopy and collided with power transmission lines.

The number four connecting rod remained attached to the piston; however, the connecting rod was separated from the crankshaft at the base of the yoke. Fragments of the associated connecting rod cap and corresponding bolt were found within the engine oil sump; only residual oil (less than one quart) was observed within the sump along with debris, which was consistent with main bearing material and had obscured the oil pickup screen.

The briefings did not include any NOTAMS indicating a contaminated runway at their destination airport.  The captain obtained a report from the local fixed base operator that a Learjet had landed earlier and reported the runway as being okay.  The tower was closed on their arrival, so they made a low pass over the airport to inspect the runways.  Based on the runway and wind conditions, they decided their best choice for landing was on runway 08L.  The captain said the landing was normal and the airplane initially decelerated with normal braking.  As they encountered snow and ice patches, the captain said he elected to deploy the thrust reversers.  The captain said that as the thrust reversers deployed, the airplane began to yaw to the left and differential braking failed to realign the airplane with the runway.  The captain said the airplane departed the left side of the runway and rotated counter clockwise before coming to rest on a southwesterly heading.  A witness on the airport said, \"I watched them touch down.  I heard the [thrust] reversers go on and then off, and then on again.  As they came back on for the second time, that's when the plane started making full circles on the runway.  This happened two, maybe three times before going off the side of the runway.\"  The airplane's right main landing gear collapsed on departing the runway, causing substantial damage to the right wing, right main landing gear and aft pressure bulkhead.  At the accident site, the right engine thrust reverser was partially deployed.  The left engine thrust reverser was fully deployed with the blocker doors extended.  An examination of the airplane revealed a stuck solenoid on the right engine thrust reverser.  No other system anomalies were found.  Approximately 33 minutes prior to the accident, the pilot requested from Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center,  the weather for the airport.  Denver Center reported the conditions as \"winds calm, visibility 6 miles with light mist, 3,000 overcast, temperature zero degrees Centigrade (C) dew point -1 degree C, altimeter three zero 30.20, and there was at least a half inch of slush on all surfaces.\"  The pilot acknowledged the information.  The NOTAM log for the airport showed that at 2115, the airport issued a NOTAM stating there was \"1/2 inch wet snow all surfaces.\"  The airport operations manager reported that at the time of the accident the runway surface was covered with 3/4 inch of wet snow.  The airport conducts a 24 hour, 7 days a week operation; however, operations support digresses to fire coverage only after 2300.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's improper in-flight planning/decision to land on the contaminated runway, the stuck thrust reverser solenoid resulting in partial deployment of the right engine thrust reverser, and the pilot's inability to maintain directional control of the airplane due to the asymmetric thrust combined with a contaminated runway.  Factors contributing to the accident were the wet, snow-covered runway, the airport's failure to remove the snow from the runway, and the pilot's failure to recognize the reported hazardous runway conditions by air traffic control."

The flight was also intended to provide cockpit familiarization for the first officer and the pilot observer, and as a training flight for the first officer. About one minute after takeoff, the first officer contacted the tower and stated that they needed to return to land. The airplane impacted a cornfield about one mile southwest of the approach end of the runway, and 2 minutes 40 seconds after the initiation of the takeoff roll. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) indicated that, during the flight, neither the captain nor the first officer called for the landing gear to be raised, the flaps to be retracted, or the power levers to be reduced from full power. From the time the first officer called \"rotate\" until the impact, the captain repeated the word \"pull\" about 27 times. When the observer pilot asked, \"Come back on the trim?\" the captain responded, \"There's nothing anymore on the trim.\" The inspection of the airplane revealed that the elevator trim cables were rigged improperly, which resulted in the trim cables being reversed. As a result, when the pilot applied nose-up trim, the elevator trim system actually applied nose-down trim. The flight crew was briefed on the maintenance work that had been performed on the airplane; therefore, when the captain\u2019s nose-up trim inputs were affecting his ability to control the airplane, at a minimum, he should have stopped making additional inputs and returned the airplane to the configuration it was in before the problem worsened.

The pilot and flight instructor were unable to perform troubleshooting steps due to the airplane\u2019s low altitude. Following a forced landing to a dirt field just short of the runway, the airplane nosed over. It was recovered the day after the accident. Although the left fuel tank was empty, the filler cap appeared to have been leaking, and it is therefore likely that the tank drained while the airplane remained inverted until it was recovered.A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The engine sustained minimal damage during the accident and ran successfully during the examination.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.According to the flight instructor, the student pilot called him while en route during a solo cross-country instructional flight and reported observing an electric current discharge of 10 amperes on the amp meter. The pilot also reported hearing a pulsating tone on the radio. During a subsequent call to the instructor, the student reportedly stated that the airplane had experienced a total electrical failure. The instructor said that he advised the student to immediately extend the airplane's electrically activated landing gear while the airplane still had remaining battery power. During the next hour, the student called his instructor four additional times and a pilot acquaintance three times. Both the instructor and the acquaintance reported that the student sounded extremely disturbed and anxious about the on\u001egoing situation during these calls.The instructor was located at the home airport when the student flew overhead between about 800 and 1,000 feet above the ground, and he observed that the airplane's landing gear appeared to be extended only halfway. He advised the student to climb to 3,000 feet, and he then instructed the student in detail on how to extend the landing gear using the emergency extension procedure. The instructor estimated that the student flew in the vicinity for about 45 minutes until he stated, \u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d which he thought meant that the gear was down and that the student intended to land. The instructor then lost track of the airplane as it flew away from his line of sight. Minutes later, he heard emergency vehicle sirens in the distance. A witness observed the airplane rapidly descending until his view of it was obscured by intervening terrain or vegetation as it approached ground level. The witness said that the airplane was descending with its nose pointed nearly straight down and that it was turning (rolling about its longitudinal axis). He reported that no fire or smoke was trailing from the airplane.The wreckage signatures and ground scar evidence were consistent with a stall-spin type accident sequence and an impact with the ground at a 45-degree nose-down angle. The landing gear was found in the down-and-locked position. No preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures were found with the airplane control systems or engine that would have precluded normal operation. The electrical generating and storage components were removed for examinations and tests. Impact damage precluded functional tests of the alternator, over voltage relay, and spike guard capacitor; however, the units passed electrical continuity checks. An output wire on the alternator was found half severed, with the ends of the strands oxidized, indicating a preexisting condition. However, the electrical component examinations could not determine the failure mode of the charging system.It is likely that the student pilot remained distracted by the reported failure of the electrical power system and failed to maintain airspeed while preparing for landing, which resulted in the subsequent stall/spin to ground impact.",
            "probable_cause": "The student pilot\u2019s failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering for landing, which resulted in a stall/spin. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's distraction and anxiety from a reported failure of the airplane's electrical system."

Flight 157 was parked at gate D36 prior to the accident and flight 406 was parked next to it at gate D34.  Flight 157 was pushed back from the gate and was stopped facing east behind flight 406 and perpendicular to the gates.  The captain reported the pushback was normal and the airplane was not positioned any closer to the gates than usual.  The captain of flight 406 stated they were ready to push back, but were advised by the tug driver that they could only push back a little because there was an airplane behind them (flight 157).  The captain advised the tug driver to push the airplane back as much as possible so they would be credited with an on-time departure.  The tug driver for flight 406 stated he could not see flight 157 behind them and as soon as he began moving the airplane both wing walkers gave the \"X\" signal to stop.  He stated the airplane had been pushed back approximately 5-6 feet.  One wing walker stated their wands were up in an \"X\" prior to flight 406 being moved because of the location of flight 157 behind them.  The captain stated that after the airplane was pushed back, he set the brakes and they were stationary for 3-5 minutes prior to the impact.  The captain of flight 157 stated his airplane was then marshalled forward.  As he made a left turn out, they felt a jolt so he stopped the airplane and contacted the ramp personnel to see what happened.  He reported the left turn was not sharp.  The marshaller for flight 157 stated the airplane moved forward very little if at all prior to starting the left turn.  The damage to N904ME, flight 157, consisted of minor damage to the outboard corner of the right side elevator trim tab end cap.  Damage to N923ME, flight 406, consisted of substantial damage to the left side elevator and the left side elevator trim tab.  Following this accident a red Pushback Clearance Reference Line was painted on the ramp area perpendicular to gates D30-D38.  Midwest Airlines then issued a Ramp Training Procedural Communication stating that when an airplane is pushed back from the gate, both main landing gear must be on the alley side of the Pushback Clearance Reference Line at all times.  In addition, Midwest Airlines reported they are revising their Company Operations manual to prohibit \"Partial Push Backs\" for the purpose of recording an on-time departure.  The revision will also state that push backs will not be initiated until the area behind and on both sides of the airplane is clear of obstructions so that a complete, uninterrupted push back can be accomplished.
