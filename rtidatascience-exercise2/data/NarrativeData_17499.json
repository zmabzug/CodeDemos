After delivering the fourth load, the pilot lifted off with only an empty bag inside the net.  The Bell 206B rotorcraft flight manual, in the supplement for external loading, states, \"Control movements should be made smoothly and kept to a minimum to prevent oscillation of sling load.\"  According to a witness, as the helicopter departed, the net \"floated very close to the propeller [tail rotor], then floated back down.\"  The net, which was attached directly to the helicopter cargo hook without the use of a long line, swung back up again and impacted the tail rotor, cutting the cargo net and releasing the bag.  The pilot heard noise and \"thumping\" sounds, accompanied by vibrations and yawing, and realized that he had a tail rotor strike.  The pilot entered an autorotation at \"25 miles per hour and 200 feet\" above a timbered slope.

Shortly after departing the hospital on a medivac flight, the pilot requested that company dispatch have the company mechanic meet him at a nearby airport because he was experiencing \"binding in the right pedal.\"  An airport employee stated that just prior to the accident, she saw the helicopter hovering over the ramp and thought it was going to land.

His typical routine was to practice over his vineyards, located about 9 miles south of the airport where he based the airplane. On the day of the accident, the pilot took off, flew directly to his vineyard, and arrived there about 3 minutes later. He spent the next 4 minutes performing maneuvers, several of which could induce high g-loads. About 25 seconds after a steep climb and an equally steep descent and level-off, the pilot made a rapid course-reversal turn and began a loop, which terminated in ground impact. The airplane impacted in an approximate wings-level attitude, with high forward velocity and minimal vertical velocity. The debris path was aligned with the loop, and was nearly perpendicular to the vineyard trellis rows constructed of steel poles, steel wires/cables and nylon mesh. As a result, the airplane was highly fragmented. All major components of the engine and airplane, including all aerodynamic control surfaces, were accounted for at the accident site. A postaccident examination of the flight control system, airplane structure, propeller, and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. \u000b\u000bThe pilot\u2019s toxicology analysis identified the low-level presence of ethanol, likely as a result of ingestion. The detected level of ethanol was unlikely, in isolation, to have significantly impaired the pilot\u2019s performance, although there may have been some negative effect. The pilot also had a significant amount of hydrocodone in his blood, and the evidence indicated that he was a chronic user. Although hydrocodone is known to have an impairing effect on infrequent users, the effects on chronic users are less well-defined, and, therefore, the level of impairment due to the hydrocodone alone could not be determined. Similarly, the performance effects of the combination of alcohol and hydrocodone are not well defined, and although the pilot may have been impaired, the extent of his impairment could not be determined.\u000b\u000bSignificant coronary artery disease and a previous infarction put the pilot at risk for an acute cardiac event, including recurrent infarction and acute arrhythmia. The toxicology revealed the presence of phendimetrazine, which, in combination with the pilot\u2019s history of hypertension, can significantly increase blood pressure, and may have exacerbated the risk of an acute cardiac arrhythmia. \u000b\u000bThe pilot had experienced g-induced loss of consciousness (g-LOC) during aerobatic maneuvers in the 3 months before the accident, but he did not report it to any medical personnel, and he did not cease aerobatic flying. Several of the maneuvers performed on the day of the accident could induce significant g-loads, and the sudden changes in cardiac work associated with g-loading and -unloading presented another risk factor for cardiac arrhythmia. \u000b\u000bTherefore, the pilot\u2019s coronary artery disease, his previous infarction, his use of phendimetrazine, and his conduct of aerobatics all increased his risk of an acute cardiac arrhythmia. It is very likely that this pilot was medically incapacitated either by g-LOC alone, or in combination with an arrhythmia, and that this resulted in the ground impact. The investigation was unable to determine what effect the pilot\u2019s chronic opioid use had on either his pre-flight decision-making or his performance during the flight.\u000b\u000b",

It was determined that the rear seat pilot was the PIC and responsible for the aircraft, and the front seat occupant, was a passenger, and was following through on the controls during the demonstration of the short field takeoff.  Both pilots agreed the taxi out and run up were normal and performed by the pilot in the front seat.  Takeoff was also normal for a short field takeoff until about 50 feet.  The front seat pilot said, '...within seconds we had lifted off and were climbing at an unbelievable angle...I remember being awe struck by the pitch angle...the attitude of the airplane was so high that I felt uncomfortable...within a few seconds the nose of the aircraft began swinging to the left and as it did, it fell and I realized we were in a deep stall.  As the nose came down [the PIC] yelled, 'I got it, I got it, I got it!'...we rolled slowly back and forth as we were settling towards the ground...we hit the ground hard in almost a flat attitude.'  The PIC said, he told the front seat pilot to 'lower the nose' and tried to 'ease the stick forward.'  He yelled, 'I have the airplane,' and pushed with both hand on the stick.  It would not move and he said it felt like '...I was pushing on a spring.'  He released his left shoulder harness in an attempt to get the attention of the pilot in the front seat.  Just as he had loosened the left shoulder harness the airplane 'stalled.'  He said he brought up the left wing and pushed the nose down.  At this point the airplane was 'sinking in a deep stall' when he pushed the nose forward, and flared the aircraft just before touchdown with a 'very high sink rate.'  He said he 'believed' the power was cut when the aircraft was 'stalled...[but he] did not have time to look inside the aircraft to determine any accurate throttle position....'  In addition, it was his opinion that he 'should not have loosened' his shoulder harness and he 'should not have allowed' the other pilot to fly from the front seat on his first takeoff in this airplane, no matter what his previous experience in other aircraft had been.  Ground witnesses observed the airplane pitch up approximately 25 to 30 degrees and climb to an altitude of 100 to 125 feet.  The left wing dropped, the airplane pitched forward, struck the left side of the runway, 500 feet from the departure end, on the right cowling and right main landing gear, spun on the nose, ending up 100 feet from the runway centerline, pointing towards departure point.  Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any discrepancies.  Confirmation of the position of the airplane's controls, immediately after the accident, could not be determine, because the airplane was removed from the crash site before it could be examined ",

In his attempt to glide to an airport about 13 miles from the failure location, the pilot overflew multiple fields and sections of roadway that were suitable for an off-field landing. The airplane struck trees 3 miles short of the intended airport, and the pilot was seriously injured. Postaccident examination revealed that the PSRU gearbox had failed catastrophically, with the result that the engine was unable to transmit power to the propeller. Investigation revealed that the accident PSRU gearbox was the manufacturer's first generation version, referred to as \"Gen-I.\" At the time of the accident, third-generation \"Gen-III\" gearboxes were current, and the manufacturer had previously determined and notified owners that replacement with the Gen-III version was mandatory. The pilot was aware of the manufacturer's mandate regarding the gearbox replacement, but based on cost and time-in-service reasons, he decided not to replace his Gen-I gearbox. While the gearbox manufacturer \"mandated\" that owners replace their previous model gearboxes, and his published information clearly stated that he had safety concerns about the previous model gearboxes, he was actually unable to force them to replace the gearboxes. Since the manufacturer did not provide the gearbox owners with substantiating data such as failure rates, time in service, or a catalog of failure events, gearbox owners could have concluded that the manufacturer's mandate was motivated by economic, instead of safety, reasons.",

One witness described the attitude of the airplane as a \u201cknife edge.\u201d The airplane descended, impacted the parallel taxiway, and continued into a hangar, where it was mostly consumed by post-crash fire. The witnesses described the sound of the engine as smooth, continuous, and at \u201cfull power\u201d until ground contact, suggesting that the pilot had not attempted to abort the high-speed taxi test/takeoff. Immediately after the accident, the pilot reported to witnesses that he had intended to fly and that the airplane was responding to his control inputs.

The airplane then began a right turn and flew on a westerly heading at a low altitude before it disappeared behind a tree line.  A witness saw the airplane as it was in a right turn toward the north.  He thought the airplane was going to land on a closed highway, but the nose of the airplane dropped and the airplane cartwheeled on the grass median west of the road.  Examination of the right engine revealed that the crankshaft gear had failed due to a fatigue fracture in one of the teeth.  The fatigue emanated from the pressure face of the tooth and intersected another crack emanating from the non-pressure face of the tooth, thereby producing separation of the tooth from the rim.  Near the origin, post-fracture damage prevented the ability to determine if the crack initiated in fatigue or if a crack propagated in overstress through the case and then continued propagating through the core in fatigue.  Upon completion of the materials examination it was evident that the microstructure of the gear was inadequate and more research into the manufacturing process was required.  A review of manufacturing records indicated that approximately 2,400 crankshaft gears were made from the same batch of material as the accident gears, and were heat-treated in two groups.  A review of the heat treatment records confirmed that furnace temperatures during the hardening step in each heat-treating process were not high enough to fully austenitize the material.  Furthermore, the quantity and orientation of gears loaded in the furnace were greater when compared to other jobs completed for TCM.  In addition, initial data from a test load similar to that used in the heat-treating process from the accident serial number gear, indicated that under these conditions, the gears might not have been fully equilibrated at temperature during the hardening step.  As a result, TCM manufactured several other gears at different hardnesses and conducted failure testing to see if they could reproduce a similar failure.  Even though some of the hardness levels were well below TCM standards, they were unable to produce a similar failure.  In addition, there was evidence to suggest that the gear teeth may have been exposed to an excessive load at some point during its operation.  The cause of the gear tooth failure could not be determined.",

The purpose of the flight was to locate icing conditions for a prototype helicopter's in-flight icing tests.  While in cruise flight, the airplane encountered icing conditions, and had accumulated about 1\" of ice on the leading edges of the wings.  The captain reported that he activated the wing deicing pneumatic boots, and the ice was shed from both wings.  About 4 minutes after activating the deice boots, both engines simultaneously lost all power.  The crew attempted several engine restarts, but were unsuccessful, and made a forced landing on frozen, snow-covered terrain.  During the landing, the airplane struck several small, burned trees, and sustained substantial damage.  The airplane's ice control system is comprised of two separate systems, one an anti-ice, the other, a deice.  The majority of the wings' surfaces are deiced by pneumatic, inflating boots.  The inboard section of the wings, directly in front of the engine air inlets, and the engine air inlets themselves, utilize a heated, anti-ice surface to preclude any ice accretion and potential for ice ingestion into the engines.  The anti-ice system is not automatic, and must be activated by the flight crew prior to entering icing conditions.  A researcher in the aft cabin photographed the airplane's wings before and after the activation of the deice boots.  The photographs taken prior to the deice boot activation depicted about 1\" of ice on the wings, as well as on the anti-ice (heated) inboard portion of the wings.  The photographs taken after the deice boot activation revealed that the ice had been removed from the booted portion of the wings, but ice remained on the inboard, anti-ice segment.   An engineer from the airplane's manufacturer said that if the anti-ice system was activated after ice had accumulated on the wings, it would take 2-4 minutes for the anti-ice portion of the wings and engine inlets to heat sufficiently to shed the ice.  A postaccident inspection of the anti-ice components found no anomalies, and there was no record of any recent problems with the anti-ice system.  The flight crew reported that the anti-ice activation switch is on the captain's side, and they could not recall if or when the anti-ice system was activated.  They stated that they did not discuss its use, or use a checklist that addressed the use of the anti-ice system.  A section of the airplane's flight manual states: \"Failure to switch on the  [anti-ice] system before ice accumulation has begun may result in engine damage due to ice ingestion.\"  An inspection by an NTSB power plant engineer disclosed catastrophic engine damage consistent with ice ingestion.         ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper use of anti-icing equipment during cruise flight, which resulted in ice ingestion into both engines (foreign object damage), the complete loss of engine power in both engines, and an emergency descent and landing on tree covered terrain.  Factors associated with the accident were the icing conditions, inadequate crew resource management, and failure to use a checklist."

The remaining two crew members conducted the entire night flight without the benefit of a customary break period. Throughout the flight the crew made comments indicating that they were fatigued and identified fatigue as their highest threat for the approach, but did not discuss strategies to mitigate the consequences of fatigue. At the time of the incident, the crew had been on duty for about 12 hours and the captain had been awake for over 22 hours, while the first officer had been awake for at least 14 hours.During the descent and approach, the flight crew was assigned a number of runway changes; the last of which occurred near the final approach fix for runway 27L. While the flight was on final approach, the crew was offered and accepted a clearance to sidestep to runway 27R for landing. Although the flight crew had previously conducted an approach briefing for two different runways, they had not briefed the approach for runway 27R and were not aware that the approach light system and the instrument landing system (ILS) were not available to aid in identifying that runway. When the crew accepted the sidestep to runway 27R, the captain, who was the flying pilot, saw the precision approach path indicator and lined the airplane up on what he said were the brightest set of lights he could see. During the final approach, the first officer was preoccupied with attempting to tune and identify the ILS frequency for runway 27R. Just prior to the airplane touching down, the captain realized they were landing on a taxiway. The airplane landed on taxiway M, 200 feet north of, and parallel to, runway 27R.Postincident flight evaluations of the airport lighting indicated that there were a number of visual cues that could have misguided the captain to align with taxiway M instead of runway 27R while on final approach. These cues included numerous taxiways signs along the sides of taxiway M which, from the air, appeared to be white and could be perceived as runway edge lights. In addition, the blue light emitting diode (LED) lights used on the eastern end of taxiway M were perceived to be brighter than the adjacent incandescent lights on the airfield and the alternating yellow and green lights in the ILS critical area provided the appearance of a runway centerline. The postincident flight evaluations indicated that when the approach lights or the ILS for runway 27R were available and used, it was clearlyevident when the airplane was not aligned with the runway.",

Winnipeg ATC directed the flight crew to contact Minneapolis ATC; the flight was operating with no radio communications (NORDO) for about 1 hour 17 minutes. Because of the proximity of the Winnipeg ATC frequency (132.125 MHz) to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (132.17 MHz), it is likely that the first officer began to dial in the new frequency but never completed the frequency change. (To make a frequency change, the pilot had to use a rotary dial to select the desired frequency and then push a button to activate the new frequency on the radio.) Furthermore, the first officer did not attempt to contact the next ATC controller after acknowledging the frequency change. The first officer stated that the last contact with ATC was shortly before they had dinner. Thus, the first officer was likely directed to change frequencies about the time that the captain was absent from the cockpit (due to a restroom break) and the flight attendant was in the cockpit (in compliance with security procedures), which coincided with the time dinner was served. These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller. Additionally, the captain\u2019s temporary absence from the cockpit would have removed the redundant monitoring of a second pilot who may have detected the incomplete frequency change or failure to check in with ATC. \tFollowing the captain\u2019s return to the cockpit, the pilots became distracted by a conversation regarding changes to the bidding process (the process by which the pilots request their flight schedule for the following month) resulting from the merger between NWA and Delta. The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention and, thus, lower their capacity to monitor their radio communications, notice the lack of contact, and recognize, via airplane instruments, the flight\u2019s progress. Both pilots stated that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188. During the pilots\u2019 conversation, the pilots opened and operated their personal laptop computers. Postincident investigation revealed that laptops could block the pilots\u2019 primary flight and navigation displays depending on their placement, but would most likely not block the upper screen of the electronic centralized aircraft monitor, where \u201cACARS [aircraft communication addressing and reporting system] MSG\u201d blinks. The computers not only restricted the pilots\u2019 direct visual scan of all cockpit instruments but also further focused their attention on non-operational issues, contributing to a reduction in their monitoring activities, loss of situational awareness, and lack of awareness of the passage of time. The pilots missed numerous visual alerts, including ACARS messages sent by NWA dispatch (ACARS does not have an aural alert) and at least nine messages regarding their position (on the multifunction control and display unit and the primary flight displays) as they neared Minneapolis-St Paul International/Wold-Chamberlain Airport without landing data entered into the flight management computer. Airline policy in effect at the time of the incident prohibited the use of portable electronic devices on the flight deck. \tAlthough the pilots indicated that they had one of their radios tuned to 121.5 MHz (the universal emergency frequency), they did not respond to calls from ATC on that frequency. It could not be determined why the pilots did not respond. Possible reasons include: the volume was turned down; the pilots were distracted; or the airplane was outside of coverage for the 121.5 MHz transmitters.ATC        NWA188 entered the first two Denver ATC sectors uneventfully; as the airplane entered the next two sectors, radio contact was not established. The controllers were preparing for a shift change, and neither sector controller\u2019s relief briefing included information that communication had not been established with the NWA188. Although the current ATC practice of using automated information transfers (electronic radar handoffs) in some sectors provides an efficient means for tracking and handing off airplanes between controllers, there are no system-wide procedures for indicating that an aircraft has been directed to switch frequencies or has communicated with ATC. Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact. When the flight was finally identified as NORDO by the next sector\u2019s controller, almost 30 minutes after NWA188\u2019s last transmission, controllers attempted to regain contact with the airplane by calling NWA dispatch personnel and requesting that they attempt to contact NWA188. The controllers indicated during interviews that this technique is commonly used initially for air carrier airplanes instead of transmitting on the universal emergency frequency of 121.5 MHz because of the limited range of sparsely located transmitters. However, when the pilots did not respond to the ACARS messages, one of the controllers made several attempts to contact the airplane on 121.5 MHz, but the pilots did not respond.        FAA Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Control Handbook, Paragraph 10-4-4. Communications Failures states, in part, the following.Take the following actions, as appropriate, if two-way radio communications are lost with an aircraft. ...a. In the event of lost communications with an aircraft under  your control jurisdiction use all appropriate means available to reestablish communications with the aircraft. These may include, but not be limited to, emergency frequencies, NAVAIDs [navigation aids] that are equipped with voice capability, FSS [flight service station], Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC), etc. ...e. If radio communications have not been (re)established with the aircraft after five minutes, consider the aircraft's activity to be possibly suspicious and handle the flight per FAAO JO 7610.4, Chapter 7, Hijacked/Suspicious Aircraft Reporting and Procedures.        Controllers and supervisors interviewed after this incident indicated that an air carrier airplane out of radio contact is not an uncommon occurrence for air traffic controllers, occasionally occurring as often as several times during an 8-hour shift. However, these interviews indicated that the losses of radio contact are usually short in duration and re-established quickly. This likely contributed to the controllers becoming complacent and not advising ATC managers of the loss of radio contact with NWA188 in a timely manner. In this incident, during which the airplane was NORDO for more than 1 hour, failure to quickly advise managers resulted in a delay in the completion of necessary actions and notifications required by the lost-communications procedures.         The NTSB makes the following conclusions regarding this incident.\u2022 The first officer acknowledged but never completed the assigned frequency change due to interruptions, likely during the time that the captain was absent from the cockpit and the flight attendant was in the cockpit.\u2022 Not completing the frequency change, contacting ATC, and maintaining communications was contrary to Federal Aviation Regulations and airline procedures and was not noticed by the flight crew because they became distracted by a conversation, during which they referenced their personal computers, focusing the pilots\u2019 attention on non-operational issues.\u2022 The pilots\u2019 conversation and use of personal computers led to reduced monitoring activities, loss of situational awareness, and lack of awareness of the passage of time.  \u2022 Sufficient visual cues, including ACARS messages and flight progress alerts, were presented to the flight crew, but the crew did not notice any of them.\u2022 Air traffic controllers did not follow procedures to ensure NWA188 was on the correct frequency, which delayed the identification of NWA188 as NORDO.\u2022 No national standardized procedures exist when automated information transfers are used instead of the paper flight progress strips to nonverbally document and confirm air traffic control information among controllers.\u2022 ATC management did not complete the required notifications for a NORDO airplane in a timely manner as required by Federal Aviation Administration directives.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight crew's failure to monitor the airplane\u2019s radio and instruments and the progress of the flight after becoming distracted by conversations and activities unrelated to the operation of the flight."

The left magneto began to work. He departed McCollum Field and went to Peachtree City. He then flew to Tara Field, at Hampton, Georgia. When leaving Tara Field, he found that the left magneto was again inoperative. He called his mechanic and was told to disconnect the \"P\" leads and fly home. With the \"P\" leads disconnected, he could not check the magnetos. During takeoff, the engine appeared to develop full power. The EGT was normal. About 5 minutes after departure, the EGT pegged out high and one of the magnetos appeared to have quit. About a minute later, the engine quit. Atlanta Approach gave him radar vectors to the closest airport, Peachtree City. He could not make it to the airport and landed in a field with the gear down and full wing flaps extended. During rollout in the field, the airplane collided with a drainage ditch. The landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a stop. The magnetos had been overhauled by a local mechanic about 100 flight hours before the accident. During examination prior to running the engine after the accident, the \"P\" lead was disconnected from the right magneto and the spark retard lead was disconnected from the left magneto. The leads were reconnected and the engine was started. Only the right magneto was operating. The engine was operated to 1,500 RPM with a club propeller in the feathered position. The was no evidence of mechanical failure or malfunction of the engine assembly.The magnetos were tested at the manufacturers facilities. The left magneto condenser was inoperative causing the magneto to not operate. The right magneto operated normally. Manufacturer personnel stated that with one magneto inoperative, the exhaust gas temperature will become elevated due inefficient burning in the cylinder which carries over into the exhaust area. When you remove the \"P\" lead on these magnetos, they actually ground internally and become inoperative. Sometimes contamination prevents them from grounding immediately when the \"P\" lead is removed, but they eventually ground and become inoperative. He believes that with the spark retard disconnected on the left magneto and the \"P\" lead disconnected on the right magneto, that the left and right magnetos operated for takeoff due to the condenser working at this time on the left magneto and that the \"P\" lead internal grounding had contamination that prevented it from grounding immediately after removal of the \"P\" lead. Takeoff was normal at full power due to both magnetos working. Then either the left magneto quit due the condenser failing or the right quit due to it becoming internally grounded.

He flew several jump flights, and then stopped early in the afternoon to prepare the airplane for the flight home. The flight was planned into an area of clouds, turbulence, and icing, which the pilot had researched. He delayed the departure until he decided that he could complete the planned flight under visual flight rules (VFR).  The accident occurred at night with little illumination of the moon, and the airplane was in an area of layered clouds. A detailed analysis of the weather conditions revealed that the flight probably encountered broken to overcast layers both below and above its flight altitude. The satellite and sounding images suggested that it was possibly in an area of mountain wave conditions, which can enhance icing. The recorded radar data indicated that the pilot was likely maneuvering to go around, above, or below rain showers or clouds while attempting to maintain VFR. The airplane likely entered clouds during the last 3 minutes of flight, and possibly icing and turbulence. It was turning when it departed from controlled flight, and a performance study showed that the angle-of-attack at this point in the flight was increasing rapidly. The study determined that the departure from controlled flight was consistent with an aerodynamic stall. The unpressurized airplane was flying at over 14,000 feet mean sea level for more than 1 hour during the flight. It reached 15,000 feet just prior to the accident in sequential 360-degree turns while climbing and descending. Supplemental oxygen was not being used. At these altitudes, the pilot would be substantially impaired by hypoxia, but would have virtually no subjective symptoms, and would likely be unaware of his impairment. The pilot had logged over 2,000 hours of total flight time, with nearly 300 hours in this make and model of airplane. He was instrument-rated, but had only logged a total of 2 hours of actual instrument flight time.

The airplane reached a maximum altitude of about 300 feet above the ground and continued for approximately 30 seconds before descending into a residential area and impacting an occupied residence. The accident flight was the first time the pilot had flown the airplane, and the first time the airplane took off from this particular airport.  The airplane had been flown by the owner/builder for about five hours prior to the accident, and at a different airport in the area.  Following the first five hours of flight, the owner/builder decided to disassemble the wings of the airplane and tow it to the accident airport because he noticed that the airplane's ground roll during the initial test flights was longer than he expected, and that oil was observed leaking from the engine cowling.  The airplane was not flown again until the accident flight, and after the leaking had been corrected.Prior to the airplane conducting any flights, it received a special airworthiness certificate as an experimental amateur-built airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) designated airworthiness representative (DAR).    The purpose of the accident flight was to test the airplane's performance with engine boost from a noncertified, belt-driven supercharger that is normally used in automotive applications. (The supercharger had been installed by the owner/builder prior to the airplane\u2019s certification review by the DAR; however, the accident flight was the first flight in which the supercharger control would be fully activated). The pilot had been assisting the owner/builder throughout the certification and flight testing processes.Postaccident examination did not reveal any preimpact anomalies with the airframe. However, the examination of the engine and accessories revealed that the supercharger belt was found lodged behind the idler pulley. No signatures consistent with rotation during the impact sequence were found during examination of the supercharger, which is indicative of the belt being detached from the supercharger. Typically, supercharger belt tension is maintained through the use of an idler pulley on a sliding adjustable plate that is secured to the supercharger housing by three bolts, designed to be secured with safety wire, in 2-inch-long adjustment slots. No safety wire was found on the bolts, and one of the bolts was observed missing. Additionally,the idler plate was in a position 1/4-inch short of the most slack belt setting (i.e. 1-3/4 inches into the 2-inch adjustment toward slack), with witness marks consistent with it being in that position at impact. The owner/builder performed a prior flight with the supercharger set to zero boost and he reported that the airplane's performance was poor. The investigation revealed that the supercharger manufacturer, in its instructions and publications, cautioned that the engine should perform like a normally aspirated engine in the event of a belt failure, but advised that ground tests should be done with the belt removed in order to simulate a failure. The manufacturer also noted that a belt failure in flight would result in a richer than normal fuel mixture, and that the pilot should compensate by adjusting the mixture in order to maintain adequate engine power. The investigation revealed that the owner/builder did not test the engine with the supercharger belt removed, and that he also had removed the idler pulley's lips in an attempt to resolve an alignment issue with the belt. At the time of the accident, the airplane was still flying within the \u201cPhase 1\u201d initial flight testing operating limitations specified by the DAR who certified the airplane as experimental amateur-built.  These limitations indicated that, \u201cafter a minimum time of five (5) hours\u201d the airplane could be flown for 25 hours of operations \u201cwhile based at [the accident airport]; OR, a one time flight to the \"Airplane Base of Operations\" may also be conducted remaining clear of all densely populated areas and congested airways\u201d At the time of the accident, Phase 1 flight operations for experimental aircraft at the accident airport were permitted by the FAA, after the aircraft had completed a minimum of 5 flight hours at an alternate airport, and after having demonstrated that it had met the minimum controllability requirements set forth in FAA regulations and advisory documents. About four months after the accident, the local FAA flight standards district office issued a memorandum to its inspectors to no longer permit any Phase 1 flight operations of experimental aircraft at the accident airport, or an adjacent local major airport, because the office deemed that the airports were not suitable for these types of operations, for \u201csafety reasons\u201d, and because they did not meet the policy in FAA Order 8130.2F which specifies that \"in the case of the first flight of an aircraft from an airport surrounded by a densely populated area, but with at least one acceptable approach/departure route of flight, the FAA must ensure that the route of flight is selected which subjects the fewest persons and least property to possible hazard\".  The memorandum also instructed the FAA inspectors to notify their assigned DARs of this revised guidance.",
            "probable_cause": "A partial loss of engine power during initial climb due to the detachment of the engine supercharger drive belt.  The detachment resulted from the owner/builder's inadequate installation of the supercharger system and belt-tensioning adjustment. "

An FAA inspector examined the engine and noted no external damage. The aircraft was equipped with a dual cased single-drive magneto and the maintenance records indicated that a 500-hour inspection had been performed on the magneto on June 13, 1998.  The mechanic reported that he checked all the points for evidence of arcing and found none.  He stated that he ran the magneto on a test bench and it ran normally.  Postaccident examination of the magneto revealed that the right points did not open and the left points would close intermittently.  It was further noted that the cam followers for both sides of the magneto were melted.  Neither capacitor passed the insulation resistance test at 400 VDC.  The magneto was test run with the original harness and capacitors attached.  Both sides of the magneto generated sparks at 500 and 1,000 rpm.  A 150-watt lamp was set up next to the magneto to simulate engine heat.  The magneto was then run at a speed approximating cruise speed.

The pilot reported that when he initiated a test flight sequence that called for the helicopter to be configured for slow flight in a shallow descent, the engine low fuel pressure light illuminated followed by an audio alert indicating an engine flame-out.  The pilot reported that he immediately entered an autorotation that required a 180-degree turn to the left in order to reach the best available landing area on the fairway of a local golf course.

The engine then lost total power, and the pilot performed a forced landing in a field. An examination of the engine revealed that a gasket between the remote oil filter adapter and the \"spin-on\" filter mounting pad had failed, which resulted in a loss of oil. The owner reported that he had lubricated the gasket with a compound upon installation. It could not be determined whether the compound had degraded the gasket.",
