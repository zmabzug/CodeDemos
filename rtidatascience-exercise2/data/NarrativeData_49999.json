The pilot, who was the registered owner, was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The private pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage. The local flight departed from Vashon Municipal Airport, Vashon, Washington about 1455 with a planned destination of Puyallup. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed.In a written statement the pilot reported that while on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern for runway 34, he configured the airplane for landing which included lowering the landing gear. He extended the downwind leg to allow for adequate spacing of other traffic and lowered the wing flaps as he turned onto the base leg. During the turn, the engine made a loud \"bang\" and began to experience a partial loss of power. The JPI engine monitor installed was indicating that the exhaust gas temperatures (EGTs) on that engines right side (cylinders number 1,3, and 5) were almost non-existent. The oil and fuel pressure gauges remained in the green, showing normal indications.The pilot further stated that gray smoke began emanating through the right side of the cockpit although he couldn't detect the source of the fire or any flames. He activated the fuel boost pump to the \"low boost\" setting and the engine began operating worse. Thereafter he turned off the boost pump and the engine appeared to temporarily gain power though the JPI now showed low EGT indications for the left cylinders. The airplane continued to descend and collided with an embankment that was located on the airport property prior to the runway. The airplane bounced and slid to a stop. As a result of the impact, the airplane incurred structural damage to the left wing.A preliminary engine examination revealed that the number 3 cylinder's piston was not intact. The cylinder was retained for further examination.",

The pilot began the takeoff run toward the north, with the wind from the north between 15 to 20 knots, and 4 to 6 foot sea swells.  When the airplane had climbed to about 10 to 15 feet, the pilot said a windshear was encountered, which pushed the airplane down.  The airplane's floats struck a wave, missed about 4 to 5 swells, and then struck another wave, which produced a loud \"bang.\"  The company guide, seated in the right front seat, told the pilot that the right float assembly was broken and displaced upward.  The airplane cleared a few additional swells, and then collided with the water.  Both float assemblies were crushed upward, and the left float began flooding.  The guide exited the airplane onto the right float, and made a distress call via a satellite telephone.  All occupants donned a life preserver as the airplane began sinking.  The pilot said that after about 15 minutes, the rising water level in the airplane necessitated an evacuation, and all occupants exited into the water, and held onto the right float as the airplane rolled left.  The airplane remained floating from the right float, and was being moved away from shore by wind and wave action.  The pilot said that one passenger was washed away from the float within about 5 minutes, and two more passengers followed shortly thereafter.  Within about 5 minutes after entering the water, the pilot said he lost his grip on the float, and does not remember anything further until regaining consciousness in a hospital.  He was told by medical staff that he had been severely hypothermic.  U.S. Coast Guard aircraft were already airborne on a training mission, and diverted to rescue the occupants.  About 1320, a C-130 flew overhead, and began dropping inflatable rafts. The company guide was the only one able to climb into a raft.  When the helicopters arrived, they completed the rescue using a hoist and a rescue swimmer.  The passengers reported that they also were unable to hold onto the airplane after entering the water, became unconscious, and were severely hypothermic upon reaching a hospital.

Global positioning system data recovered from the wreckage indicated that the airplane\u2019s ground speed at that time was about 160 knots (kts) (184 mph). Witnesses observed the airplane\u2019s nose pitch up just before the outboard 6-foot section of the right wing separated, and the airplane descended uncontrollably and impacted the ground. Although the pilot/owner seated in the left front seat was not rated to operate a multi-engine land airplane, he was known to perform ostentatious maneuvers in the accident airplane on previous occasions. The pilot seated in the right front seat was rated to operate a multi-engine land airplane. A placard above the airspeed indicator indicated, \u201cManeuvering --- 135 KTS (155 MPH)\u201d; therefore, the pilot\u2019s low pass and subsequent pitch up maneuver, consistent with an ostentatious display, was performed at an airspeed that exceeded this operating limitation. Postaccident metallurgical examination of airplane\u2019s structure revealed that the right wing forward spar upper cap failed in compressive buckling. Although the left wing did not fail in flight, it showed buckling characteristics similar to the right wing, indicating that both wings were overloaded in upward bending.The airplane was modified under 22 different supplemental type certificates (STCs), which included separate STCs for a short field take-off and landing (STOL) kit, an extended wingtip fuel tank, and winglets. The investigation found evidence that the combined effects of the multiple STC modifications on the accident airplane may have adversely affected the airplane\u2019s wing structure because the combined effects of the STCs were not accounted for. For example, although not a factor in the in-flight breakup, skin fatigue cracks were observed at certain stations on the wing, which indicate that the airplane was subjected to vibratory stresses. Therefore, although each individual STC modification did not pose a concern, the combination of STCs on the accident airplane created wing loads that were not initially evaluated. As a result of this accident investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reevaluated the STCs and determined that revised operating limitations should be disseminated and implemented for this airplane; the FAA issued airworthiness directives (ADs) 2010-21-18 and 2011-15-11 to help address these issues. These ADs are available from the FAA\u2019s website at . In addition, concurrent with this investigation, the NTSB investigated another accident (NTSB identification ERA10FA404)involving an airplane with multiple STCs installed and discovered that the FAA does not provide any guidance to an STC installer to help the installer determine the interrelationship between multiple STC modifications.",

The approach appeared normal to slightly high, and on short final (about 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation), the flight encountered a very strong and turbulent gust that necessitated immediate full power. He applied power and the engine hesitated or stumbled. He removed carburetor heat application and pushed forward on the throttle and mixture controls. Thereafter, he pumped the throttle control in an effort to restore engine power which was unsuccessful. He maneuvered the airplane to a clear space and landed in a wooded area. Inspection of the engine by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector following recovery of the airplane revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction. A surface observation weather report approximately 17 minutes before the accident, indicated the temperature and dew point were 18 and 13 degrees Celsius respectively, (64 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit). According to a FAA Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) CE-09-35, dated June 30, 2009, the temperature and dew point were favorable for serious icing at glide power.",

As I applied throttle I didn't notice the turbo charger kick in and wrote it off to the bumpy grass field.  Acceleration seemed a little sluggish but again attributed it to the grass field and being close to maximum gross weight (I normally fly out of Detroit City; this was my fourth departure from Arnold Field and my first from runway 25).  About 2/3 of the way down the runway I realized that there was a serious performance problem.  I rotated at a little over 60 knots and the wheels cleared the grass; I presumed the plane would then perform since I wouldn't have the retarding effect of the grass.  Looking up I could see power lines above me and realized that I would not clear them.  The plane continued to under perform; I pulled up on the yoke and the stall warning went off.  I lowered the nose and looked for a place I might get under the power lines and over the trees.  It was clear that that wouldn't happen and I lowered the nose and tried to aim for a thin spot in the tree line.  The right wing clipped a phone pole and we crashed through the trees, over the road and came to rest in a freshly plowed field.\"  A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.  The airplane's engine was test run on the airframe.  The engine ran from idle to a power setting of 34 inches of manifold pressure.  Power was not increased beyond 34 inches due to safety concerns during the test.  During the test run, the magneto's were checked and the propeller was cycled.  No anomalies were noted during the test run.  FAA publication \"THE SAFE PILOT'S 12 GOLDEN RULES - FAA-P-8740-7\" states, \"9. TAKEOFF/LANDING LIMITS -- Plan ahead . . .

The resultant misalignment resulted in jet blast being directed onto and melting a portion of the rudder support structure. Although there was no indication of the problem in flight, during the landing roll, the pilot discovered that the rudder did not function properly, and directional control had to be maintained by alternate means. During the investigation, it was determined that five other racing airplanes of the same make and model had been modified in a similar manner and that there were slight structural variations and areas of poor welding associated with some of the mounts.As a result of this accident, the manufacturer of the engine modification instituted a program to obtain an independent professional engineering analysis of the engine mount design. Later, in response to another accident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued Safety Recommendation A-12-13, which asked the Reno Air Race Association (RARA) to require aircraft owners to provide an engineering evaluation for aircraft with any major modification. On August 27, 2012, pending receipt of further information showing that the process proposed by RARA specifically requires an owner of an aircraft with a major modification to provide an engineering evaluation that includes flight demonstrations and analysis within the anticipated flight envelope, the NTSB classified the recommendation Open-Acceptable Response.",

Before takeoff, there was some surface wind, but it subsided around the time the balloons were ready to take off. The balloons took off about 0730. The plan was to drift eastward, but once airborne, the pilot noted that the balloons were being pushed to the south. About 20 to 30 minutes into the flight, the wind increased and was accompanied by updrafts and downdrafts. The pilot reported that the balloons were moving fast and that the bottom of his balloon envelope was becoming concave, which was causing heat and air to spill out of the balloon. The pilot looked toward the ground and saw the trees rustling and he realized that the wind speed was faster than he had expected. After seeing another balloon land and then get dragged by the wind, the pilot decided that he needed to land his balloon immediately, so he located the \"biggest place\" he could find before he reached power lines south of his location. When the balloon touched down, the basket tipped over and was immediately dragged. The pilot pulled in the vent line to spill the air from the envelope. He reported that, after half of the air was out, the balloon was still moving quickly across the ground but that he finally got the balloon to stop after it had moved about 200 yards. One passenger sustained a serious injury. A review of meteorological data available at the time of the preflight briefing indicated, in part, that wind from the west existed at 10 knots or less before takeoff. The National Weather Service (NWS) terminal area forecast expected easterly wind shifting to the northwest at 13 knots during the anticipated flight with wind from the north gusting to 23 knots after 1000 mountain daylight time. The NWS area forecast did not expect any high wind across Colorado. The NWS Aviation Forecast Center had no advisories current for low-level turbulence or high winds over Colorado surrounding the anticipated flight. However, shortly after takeoff, a sudden increase in wind speed occurred across the region with wind gusts from 20 to 38 knots. The NWS misjudged the timing and underestimated the magnitude of the frontal boundary moving across the region. It is likely that, if the pilot had known about the gusting wind at the time of takeoff, he may not have chosen to fly that day.",

About the same time, a light sport airplane (LSA) was taxiing out of a ramp area on a stub taxiway, towards taxiway A, for a planned departure.

According to both persons on board the LSA, as they approached the taxiway, they looked to the right and left, and then proceeded onto taxiway A via a right turn. Shortly after the LSA joined the taxiway centerline, the Long EZ's right vertical stabilizer struck the LSA's left aileron. The LSA's rotating propeller struck the right canard of the Long EZ.

Crew statements and recorded data for both flights did not indicate any airplane anomalies prior to the events.  Shortly before the unreliable airspeed events, each airplane encountered a visible effect of the weather conditions, the Northwest crew reported seeing moderate rain and hail, and the TAM crew reported an abrupt temperature change and St. Elmo\u2019s Fire.  Within seconds both airplane\u2019s autopilot and autothrust disconnected, master warnings and cautions were indicated, primary airspeed display was lost or fluctuated, and the airplanes transitioned into Alternate Flight Law.  According to Airbus documentation and analysis, if an airspeed discrepancy of more than 20kts or an altitude discrepancy of more than 400ft is detected between one ADR and the two others, the subject ADR is rejected. Then if a discrepancy occurs between the two remaining ADR, all auto flight functions are lost and autopilot, flight director, and autothrust disconnect.  Applicable procedures for both airplanes call for autopilot and autothrust to be OFF, and for the pilot to pitch to 5 degrees and set thrust levers to the CLB detent.  Both flight crews turned the airplanes to exit the weather area and the airspeed indications returned to normal within a short time.The behavior of the airplane systems is consistent with, and supports a brief and temporary blockage of two or more pitot probes likely by an accretion of ice crystals aloft.  Existing airplane flight manual/QRH procedures were sufficient to prevent a dangerous situation from occuring, however the airplane would, as designed, be operating in a lower level of automation.  The autopilot disengaged automatically as intended due to its airspeed monitoring function.  The flight crew\u2019s attempt to reengage the autopilot during the unreliable airspeed event, and erroneous altitude reading, followed by pilot side stick inputs, exacerbated the altitude excursion experienced by the TAM flight, however the airplane was not actually in danger of a stall.",

All of the small fatigue cracks at the origin areas were covered by the washers and would not have been visually detectable.  Although the Safety Board issued previous recommendations about this issue, the Federal Aviation Administration reported that the visual inspections called out in the maintenance manuals are, \"...adequate to detect cracks in the main landing gear struts and that additional airworthiness action is not warranted.\"  On March 25, 2002, the NTSB responded by stating, in part: \"The Safety Board continues to believe that a visual inspection alone will not detect cracks in the Cessna main landing gear spring struts. However, the Safety Board acknowledges that the statistical evidence does not warrant issuance of ADs at this time as called for in the Board's recommendation.\" The safety recommendation was then classified as: \"Closed-Reconsidered.\"",

The Beaver sustained minor damage to the floats, and the Turbine Otter sustained substantial damage to the top portion of the wings, the fuselage, and vertical stabilizer.  The collision occurred over an area of coastal channels and fjords.  The pilot of the Beaver stated that his airplane was the first of three company airplanes to depart.  Once airborne, and clear of the class E airspace, he changed radio frequencies to monitor a common traffic advisory frequency.  He said that about 15 minutes after departure, while in level cruise flight, about 2,000 feet above the water, he felt a sudden thump, followed by a pronounced airframe shudder.  He then observed the top of the left wing of the Turbine Otter to his left side, just under the floats of his airplane.  He said that just after the two airplanes collided, the Turbine Otter made a left, descending turn, away from his airplane.  He said that after determining that he still had full flight control, he elected to return to the operator's base of operation.

He was on the return leg of a cross-country flight and had experienced no problems with the airplane or engine on the outbound leg.  The pilot did not note any anomalies during the engine run up prior to takeoff on the return leg, and thought that takeoff performance was similar to previous takeoffs with passengers on board.  The pilot established the airplane in cruise at 4,500 feet and an airspeed of 90 knots on an airway about 7 miles from the shoreline.  He established 2,200 revolutions per minute (rpm) and leaned for cruise.  Immediately thereafter, the engine speed dropped to 1,000 rpm.  He did not recall any loud noises; he just noted the loss of engine rpm.  He attempted to diagnose the problem, but his efforts had no results.  The engine stopped, and he made a turn towards the shore.  During the glide the pilot was able to affect a restart, but the engine lost power in less than 2 minutes and the rpm never rose above 1,000.  The pilot told air traffic control that he wasn't going to make it to shore, and ditched the airplane about 300 yards offshore.  The pilot and the passengers exited the airplane before it sank in 70 feet of water.  They were on the top of the airplane for about a minute before it sank.  Local authorities rescued the pilot and recovered one victim; one victim was not recovered and is presumed to be deceased.  Investigators were unable to establish magneto timing or obtain spark during the wreckage examination.  Disassembly of the magneto revealed that the impulse coupling spring was fractured and separated at two places.  Upon reassembly without the impulse coupling, one magneto fired on all four leads; the other magneto fired intermittently on three leads due to salt water corrosion on the contacts.  Metallurgical examination revealed that the surfaces of both coupling spring fractures exhibited micro features of corrosion on the surfaces.  These fractured areas appeared consistent with stress corrosion cracking.  Optical and scanning electron microscope examinations of the spring pieces uncovered many areas of corrosion and corrosion pitting on the spring surfaces.  The corrosion pitting was particularly evident on the edges of the springs, but other corrosion areas were visible on the flat faces of the spring.  A broken spring could retard the magneto timing to top dead center or after (the specified timing is 25 degrees before top dead center).  The engine logbooks showed that the magneto inspections required in Airworthiness Directive 96-12-07 had been complied with.

The accident site was located on a southeast-facing slope of a mountain about 200 ft below the top of the ridgeline. The airplane impacted terrain in a wings-level attitude, and a postimpact fire ensued. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot was descending the airplane at night over rural, mountainous terrain that provided few visual ground reference references; therefore, it is likely that he did not see the rising terrain as the airplane continued toward its final destination, which was at a lower altitude.

The pilot and passenger then boarded the helicopter. A witness watched as the helicopter climbed vertically to a height just above the trees to its left and the utility lines to its front, and hovered for a few seconds. While hovering, the landing light of the helicopter cycled on and off two times. The helicopter then pitched nose down and accelerated forward. Instead of climbing, the helicopter accelerated forward in a shallow descent until it impacted the ground. The witness described that the conditions of darkness and fog prevented him from making his way to the accident scene without the aid of a light. Several other witnesses described similar conditions around the time of the accident. Forecasted and actual recorded weather conditions in the area around the time of the accident were consistent with the observations of the witnesses. The ceiling and visibility conditions were significantly worse than the minimum values required by the company's operations specifications. Further review of the operations specifications revealed that the pilot was required to report any changes in her itinerary to the operator. No evidence was found to indicate that the pilot had notified the operator of her initial deviation and subsequent landing in the field, or of her intent to depart from that field after sunset. Additionally, during postaccident interviews the operator could not clearly articulate its actual method for determining whether an aircraft was overdue, since no one individual was charged with that specific duty for operations after normal business hours.

The airplane had been operated earlier that day in the morning and afternoon orbiting throughout areas of the county between witness reported altitudes of between 300 and 500 feet agl on the same type of mission by  the same pilot. After departure on the accident flight, the flight continued the aerial observation and according to one witness, on the last pass, the airplane was observed in a large clockwise orbit noticeably lower than the 300 to 500 feet agl previously observed. A sputtering noise was heard by one witness, and another stated there was no engine sound at all just before she observed the aircraft depart normal upright flight. From an altitude of about 120 to 150 feet agl, she saw the aircraft simultaneously nose over vertically and commence a right half roll into the terrain. The airplane came to rest inverted in a field containing cotton crops. One EMT who was on-scene within minutes of the accident reported observing a finger sized stream of fuel leaking from the left wing root area; the leakage lasted an estimated 15-20 minutes. Other personnel on scene stated they did not smell a strong odor of fuel after arriving within minutes of the crash. There was no evidence of leakage from the right fuel tank; the header tank was impact damaged. The fuel selector was found positioned to the \"both\" position.

The pilot initiated the crossfeed procedure in an effort to supply fuel to both engines from the left main tank. Shortly after beginning the crossfeed procedure, both engines experienced a total loss of power. The pilot notified air traffic control (ATC) and selected a field to perform a forced landing. Prior to touchdown, the right engine produced a surge of power and, in response, the airplane rolled to the left. The surge abruptly ended and the pilot continued the forced landing by lowering landing gear and extending the flaps. The airplane impacted the ground, coming to rest in an open field.

After \"dragging in\" for 5-miles I attained my test final approach speed of 60 mph. There was a tree in my glide path so I climbed over it but underestimated my sink rate (which was the purpose of the test flight) the right gear snagged a limb which jerked me into a right hand roll. I applied power, leveled the wings, and pointed [the] nose ahead as it hit the ground. There were no visible markings on the runway to indicate a displaced threshold. The reason for the displaced threshold is the tree. If the runway was properly marked, I am sure I would have been reminded at least a mile out or one-half out that there was a displaced threshold and avoided the incident.\"",

            "narrative": "On March 30, 2015, about 1435 central daylight time, a Bell 206 L-1, N50KH, operated by T&M; Aviation for the U. S. Forest Service, was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Saucier, Mississippi. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed; however, obscuration due to smoke were reported by multiple eyewitnesses and no flight plan was filed. The commercial pilot and one flight crew member were fatally injured; another flight crew member received serious injuries. The public use aerial application flight had departed from Dean Griffin Memorial Airport (M24), Wiggins, Mississippi, about 1334.The public use flight was contracted by the U. S. Forest Service to assist in a controlled burn through a process known as \"aerial ignition.\" Multiple witnesses were in contact with the accident helicopter from the ground during the operation; however, none of the witnesses observed the helicopter crash. Preliminary satellite tracking data indicated that the helicopter had been operating at a low altitude over the controlled burn area for approximately 50 minutes prior to the accident. The last recorded position for the helicopter at 1433, indicated that it was at an altitude of 350 feet, and a heading of 150 degrees. According to a witness, seconds prior to the accident he observed the helicopter complete a 180 degree left turn to a northerly heading. About 7 seconds later he heard a sound that resembled an air hose being unplugged from a high pressure tank, which was followed by the helicopter impacting trees and then the ground.The accident site was located in a wooded area on a northerly heading about one quarter mile north of a road. The initial impact point was identified by several broken trees, at a height of about 80 feet, and was located about 1,000 feet southeast of the helicopter's final recorded position. The wreckage path was about 40 feet long, and oriented approximately 002 degrees magnetic. Both the tail rotor and tailboom sustained fire damage and were co-located near a tree 20 feet south of the main wreckage. The tailboom was separated into five sections; each section contained a Thomas disc coupling, a hanger bearing and about 3 feet of tail rotor drive shaft. A two foot section of tail rotor drive shaft extended from the 90 degree gearbox of the tail rotor assembly. The high skid landing gear was separated from the fuselage and located a few feet aft of the main wreckage. The helicopter upper deck section, which included the main rotor, transmission, and collective/cyclic hydraulic servos, was attached to the fuselage and had sustained fire damage. The cockpit and cabin were destroyed by fire with the exception of the center window frame and portions of the instrument panel, which were co-located with the fuselage. Both main rotor blades sustained significant fire damage, but were attached to the main rotor hub: Blade A (the white blade) was slightly bent opposite the direction of the rotation and Blade B (the red blade) displayed two 45 degree chordwise bends. The tip to Blade B exhibited signs of overload separation that was consistent with impact forces and was located about 20 feet northeast of the main wreckage.Postaccident examination of the airframe was conducted at the accident site. Flight control continuity was traced from the collective/cyclic hydraulic servos to the swash plate and pitch change links, respectively. Hand rotation of the main drive shaft confirmed the presence of drive continuity through the main transmission to the main rotor blades. Both pitch change links fractured on impact; the Blade A pitch change link exhibited fracture signatures at the swaged end that were consistent with overload forces and the link to Blade B fractured about mid-span. The main rotor hub assembly sustained little damage, but was completely intact. Each fractured section of the tail rotor drive shaft displayed evidence of overload separation at the fracture ends; however, all sections rotated freely by hand through their respective hanger bearings and flexible Thomas couplings. Continuity of the tail rotor drive system was traced from the tail rotor through the gearbox to the steel tail rotor drive shaft that was mounted to the freewheeling unit on the engine gearbox. There were no indications of spline drive wear on the tail rotor spline shaft coupling at the freewheeling unit and the main drive shaft did not exhibit any resistance when moved forward and aft.The pilot held a FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate with ratings for rotorcraft, airplane single engine land, and instrument airplane. He also held an airframe and powerplant certificate. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on February 23, 2015, at which time he reported 8,000 hours of total flight experience.",

The briefing also included convective weather advisories, a convective outlook, the area forecast, pilot reports, radar summary, and winds aloft information. The area forecast included overcast ceilings at 1,500 feet mean sea level (msl) with cloud tops at 6,000 feet msl, visibility between 3 and 5 miles, light rain and mist, and isolated thunderstorms with cumulonimbus tops to 35,000 feet msl. After the pilot departed, he established contact with air traffic control; the airplane was initially observed on radar heading toward the destination airport. An analysis of radar from the day of the accident indicated that isolated thunderstorms existed and that, almost 4 minutes after departing, the airplane encountered an area of developing rain showers and vertical updrafts. The airplane began a descending right turn followed by a brief climb, then another descent; its ground speed slowed from 202 knots to 110 knots before the data ended. At that time, the airplane was at 4,500 feet msl. A witness said he heard the airplane but was unable to see it due to the low cloud layer. A few moments later, he saw the airplane exit the cloud layer in a spin before it impacted the ground. A postaccident examination revealed no mechanical deficiencies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane and engine. ",

Witnesses reported that the helicopter made a normal departure. They subsequently reported seeing components separate from the helicopter before it descended and impacted the ground. The helicopter came to rest in a corn field approximately 1.2 miles from the departure point. A postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that an 8-foot section of one of the main rotor blades separated in-flight rendering the helicopter uncontrollable. Metallurgical examination determined that the blade failed as a result of fatigue cracking. The origin of the fatigue crack coincided with a large void between the blade spar and an internal lead weight. Further investigation determined that the presence of residual stresses in the spar from the manufacturing process, in combination with excessive voids between the spar and the lead weight, likely resulted in the fatigue failure of the blade. The manufacturer issued an alert service bulletin that identified main rotor blades that may have been affected by the combination of residual stresses and excessive voids between the spar and the lead weight.

While on the final leg of the approach, \"everything was normal and the approach was stable.\" As the airplane approached the runway he saw yellow water filled barrels, depicting the displaced threshold. Assuming he would clear the barrels, he began to focus on the runway, failing to maintain an adequate flight path and clearance with the barrels. As a result, the left main geared struck one of the barrels and \"sheared it off,\" causing substantial damage to the left wing and left horizontal stabilizer. The pilot did not report any mechanical malfunctions with the airplane prior to impact.",

During the forced landing, the nose landing gear collapsed when it contacted \"heavy snow and unimproved terrain,\" resulting in substantial damage to the firewall. A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that one of the connecting rods had separated from the crankshaft. Metallurgical examination determined that one of the two connecting rod bolts had failed in overstress. The second connecting rod bolt was deformed but otherwise intact; its associated nut had separated from the bolt and was undamaged. The lack of damage to one of the connecting rod nuts in conjunction with the overstress failure of the opposing bolt was consistent with a loss of installation torque on the intact nut. The engine had accumulated 2,836 hours since overhaul. The operator did not supply engine overhaul maintenance records but provided a statement indicating that the installed bolts and nuts were new at the engine cylinder's last maintenance (an engine manufacturer service bulletin instructs that connecting rod bolts and nuts be replaced any time they are removed). However, due to the lack of maintenance records and the number of hours since last overhaul, the investigation could not conclusively attribute the loss of preload torque to the overhaul operation.",
            "probable_cause": "The loss of preload torque on a connecting rod nut and bolt, which precipitated a separation of the connecting rod from the engine's crankshaft and resulted in the total loss of engine power."
