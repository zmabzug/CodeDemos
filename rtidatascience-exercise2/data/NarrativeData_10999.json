The helicopter was about 1,500 feet above ground level with about 80 - 85 knots of airspeed when within a split-second he heard two loud \"bangs.\"  The nose of the helicopter pitched down and the helicopter yawed to the right.  He applied left pedal but without effect.  He attempted to \"get more forward airspeed,\" but each time he did the helicopter nosed over and yawed to the right.  The right yaw developed into a tight spin, and he realized that he \"lost his tail rotor.\"  The pilot executed an autorotation to a clearing located at a campground.  The helicopter impacted the trees at the western edge of the clearing during the autorotation.  The helicopter impacted the terrain on its right, front side.  Inspection of the helicopter revealed that the tail rotor output shaft and the tail rotor blades separated from the tail rotor gearbox.  The tail rotor assembly was inspected at the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory.  The inspection revealed that the tail rotor blade assembly fractured through the root fitting in the general area that coincided with a hole for the blade retention bolt. The root fitting contained a 1-inch nominal diameter longitudinal hub bore with a tapered (conical) hole bottom.  A relief radius was located between the hub bore and the conical hole bottom.  The inspection revealed crack arrest marks typical of a fatigue cracking that emanated from multiple origins at the relief radius between the hub bore and conical hole bottom.  The relief radius measured approximately 0.001 inch, much less than specified by the engineering drawing (0.12 inch and 0.15 inch).  On April 26, 2007, McDonnell Helicopters, Inc. (MDHI) issued mandatory Service Bulletin (SB) 369D-204, 369E-099, 369F-084, 369H-247, titled \"Tail Rotor Blade Assembly, One Time Inspection.\"  According to MDHI SB, before further flight, the tail rotor should be removed from helicopter models 369 (Army YOH-6A), 369 (Army OH-6A), 369H, 369HM, 369HS, 369HE, 369D, 369E, 369F, and 369FF.  The hub bore should be visually examined with a flashlight.  If the relief radius does not contain a smooth transition between the bore and conical bottom hole, the root fitting should be removed from service.  On April 27, 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration issued emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2007-09-51 that mandated inspection of the root fittings per the MDHI SB.         ",

The pilot was flying southbound along a racecourse on a photo flight when he made a hard 180-degree turn, and lost control of the helicopter.  As the helicopter began a spin to the right, the pilot noted a loss of rpm and altitude.  He asked the certified flight instructor (CFI)/safety pilot to take the flight controls.  As the CFI took control of the helicopter, he realized that the rpm's were decaying and that the helicopter was too low to recover the rpm.  He attempted to cushion the impact with the collective.  Both pilots reported that there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airframe or engine.  No evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunction was found during the post accident investigation that would have precluded normal operation.  During the accident flight, the helicopter was running approximately 131 pounds over the maximum gross weight for an Out of Ground Effect hover for the existing atmospheric conditions.  The helicopter was being operated in a high density altitude environment, which was computed to be 7,350 feet mean sea level.

He initiated an autorotation, and the helicopter subsequently landed hard in an adjoining orchard. The pilot removed the helicopter from the accident site immediately following the accident and began disassembling it and sending components out for repair before it was examined. During the subsequent examination of the helicopter, both the elastomeric ring and lower drive lugs (engine side) of the main transmission torsional drive coupling were found sheared off, which would have resulted in the loss of drive to the main rotor system described by the pilot.The pilot did not make the torsional drive coupling available for followup examination and reported that he had misplaced the airplane\u2019s maintenance logbooks. The torsional drive coupling incorporated an internal set of lugs designed to provide positive drive to the transmission if the elastomeric portion of the coupling failed. The lugs had sheared off, which indicated that the elastomeric coupling had failed before the accident flight. The coupling had a finite service life but, because no maintenance records were provided for examination, it could not be determined if it was within its life limit at the time of the accident. Almost 4 years before the accident flight, the helicopter had been involved in another accident, which destroyed the main rotor blades. The pilot could not provide evidence that the coupling was replaced after that accident, and, without access to the airplane\u2019s maintenance logbooks, it could not be determined if a routine inspection of the coupling had been performed.

The injured FA's were standing in the aft galley securing from the meal service when the event occurred and the passengers were seated with belts fastened.  In response to an ATC instruction, the flight was descending to maintain 27,000 feet; the controller had told the crew to maintain a good rate of descent (the airplane was descending about 4,000 feet per minute), and an indicated airspeed of 300 knots or greater.  The flight was in instrument meteorological conditions at the time and had no outside visual reference.  The controller advised the flight of opposite direction traffic at 26,000 feet and a traffic alert symbol was being displayed on the crew's TCAS indicator.  As the flight was leveling off at 27,000, the opposite direction traffic passed almost directly beneath the flight.  Immediately, the GPWS annunciated the warning, \"terrain, whoop, whoop, pull-up.\"  In accordance with the mandatory provisions of the company flight operations manual, the crew executed the proscribed escape maneuver, which, in part, calls for an aggressive application of thrust and a rapid nose pitch up to a 20-degree attitude.  Later analysis of the DFDR data showed that the crew only rotated the nose to an 8-degree nose up attitude during the maneuver.  During the maneuver, the g-loads generated on the airplane varied between +2.5 and +0.5 over a 2-second time period, which was caused the FA's injuries.  As part of the investigation, this flight's profile was flown in a Boeing 757 simulator four times.  When flown according to operations manual instructions, the g-loads generated ranged from a low of +2.0 to a high of +4.0.  It should be noted that the simulator computer computes the g-loads and can display them to the instructor; however, the simulator does not generate visceral feedback to the crew of the amount of g's being experienced.  As early as 1988, Boeing became aware that the dash number model GPWS computer installed in the airplane was subject to issuing false warnings when the airplane overflew another airplane.  In response, Boeing issued an all operators letter advising of the problem and issued a service letter in 1989 advising of an upgrade to the GPWS computer to prevent false nuisance warnings.  Between 1987 and 1999, 3 service bulletins and 13 service letters were issued advising of modifications to the GPWS and Radio Altitude systems to prevent false warnings.  None of these improvements were accomplished by the airline, and the GPWS unit installed in the accident airplane was three upgrades behind the current configuration.  The company decision to do Service Bulletin upgrades was based applicability, priority, and budget availability.  Service Letters were not routinely reviewed when received, but were filed for later review when discrepancy history patterns indicated a need.  For the Boeing 757, the GPWS, TCAS, and Radio Altitude (RA) systems are all interrelated, with the captain's (left side) RA unit providing data input to the GPWS and the TCAS.  Review of the maintenance records disclosed that in the 16 months prior to the accident, the GPWS and/or RA systems on this airplane were written up as erratic, providing false warnings, or inoperable 45 times, with 18 discrepancies written up in the 60 days prior to the accident.  On three occasions, the GPWS system provided terrain warnings at high altitudes when flying a profile very similar to the accident flight.  In accordance with the maintenance manual procedures, the corrective actions largely consisted of removal and replacement of the affected units or sub units.  No evidence was found of any diagnostic trouble shooting procedures outside of those specified in the maintenance manuals undertaken by the airline.  The airline's maintenance operations control has a system to track problematic airplanes for special maintenance attention, which requires three write-ups in the same ATA code within 10 days to trigger an alert; the accident airplane's discrepancy history pattern fell outside of this \"3 in 10\" trigger parameter.  Flight crews have no ready access to this system and only see on a routine basis the last 10 log sheets where discrepancies are entered.  In the 60 days following the accident, extensive examinations of the airplane and/or the GPWS/RA systems was conducted three times in response to continued problems with these systems, with no conclusive hard faults identified.  At the end of this 60-day period the RA units were being examined at the system's manufacturer due to a failure that could not be replicated in testing, the manufacturer told the airline that it was aware that the system's central processors could become desynchronized during power transfers and cause erratic behavior in the units.  Another cause of earlier (problem corrected before accident flight) erratic behavior in the airplane's RA system was the installation by maintenance of antennas that were incompatible with the computer units; this was due to the airline parts stocking system that carried all dash number models under the same part number.",
            "probable_cause": "the systemic failure of the airline's maintenance department to identify and correct the long standing history of intermittent faults, nuisance warnings, and erratic behavior in this airplane's GPWS system.  Also causal is the airline's failure to perform the service bulletins and service letter upgrades to the system, which would have eliminated or greatly reduced the likelihood of this particular nuisance warning, a condition that was identified and corrected by the manufacturers 11 years prior to the accident, and was the subject of one or more of the SB/SL upgrades."

When the helicopter became overdue for its routine position report, the company attempted unsuccessfully to contact the pilot through several means, including radio and telephone. The company conducted an aerial search along the route of flight; however, the helicopter was not located. The company then notified the Coast Guard of the missing helicopter approximately an hour and forty minutes after it became overdue. The wreckage was located 2 miles offshore in 13 to 15 feet of water, along the helicopter's route of flight. An examination of the helicopter airframe, engine, and related systems revealed no anomalies. Damage was consistent with controlled flight into the water. A cold front had just passed through the area several hours prior to the accident. Visible satellite imagery around the time of the accident depicted mid- to high-level cloud layers in the vicinity of the accident location. Breaks in the upper cloud layers depicted low stratus-type clouds within 15 nautical miles of the accident location. AIRMETS for instrument meteorological conditions, turbulence, and icing were valid for the accident area and route of flight. Cloud bases were most likely below 1,000 feet above ground level and visibility was restricted due to mist and possible light snow. The air temperature was recorded at 34 degrees Fahrenheit and the water temperature was recorded at 64 degrees Fahrenheit. There was no record to indicate that the pilot had obtained a formal weather briefing from a recorded source. The pilot held a commercial certificate and an instrument rating; however, he was not approved for instrument flight under Part 135 and was not current. At the time of the accident the company did not have a formal risk assessment program and a formal evaluation of the flight risks was not performed for the accident flight. The pilot normally flew a helicopter in which the flight tracking system engaged when the master switch was turned on; however, the accident helicopter required the system to be activated by a separate switch in the cockpit. This variation was not in the checklist. According to company records, the pilot had been flying the accident helicopter for two or three days prior to the accident. During this time there was no track record for the helicopter, which is consistent with the pilot not activating the helicopter's flight tracking system. The pilot, whose personal flotation device was inflated and secured, suffered severe chest injuries complicated by asphyxia due to drowning. Two passengers were secured within their flotation devices; however, neither flotation device had been inflated. Two passengers were not wearing flotation devices when they were located; however, two personal flotation devices from the accident flight were recovered and showed signatures consistent with use.

The impact occurred approximately 3.7 miles short of the approach end of the runway.  Radar data depicted that after the 8,700-hour commercial pilot was vectored to the ILS Runway 3 approach, the airplane remained left throughout the approach before turning right of the localizer approximately 2 miles before the final approach fix (FAF).  Radar then showed the aircraft turn to the left of course line.  When the aircraft was abeam the FAF, it was approximately 1 mile left of the course line.

Given that the ambient air temperature, the fuel flow condition (takeoff), and the likely engine temperature were conducive to the occurrence of vapor lock, it is possible that the loss of engine power was due to vapor lock; however, insufficient evidence existed to determine whether vapor lock occurred during the accident flight.

The maneuver, which is also practiced as a simulated engine failure, involves a 360-degree change of direction to a preselected landing spot. The pattern is designed to be circular, but the turn may be shallowed, steepened, or discontinued at any point to adjust the accuracy of the flight path. Flaps and landing gear can also be used to control descent rate. The maneuver generally commences about 2,000 feet over the intended landing spot (high key), descends to a 180-degree position about 1,000 to 1,200 feet (downwind key, or low key), continues to a 90-degree position about 800 feet (base-leg key) with a turn to final at a minimum of 300 feet. Radar data revealed that the airplane commenced the maneuver about 2,000 feet over the runway, but arrived at a 180-degree position about 400 feet high, and at a 90-degree position about 500 feet high. It continued around the circuit still high, and approaching the runway, the flight instructor advised the controller that student training was in progress, right base for the \u201coption.\u201d After being cleared for the option, the airplane descended to 1,100 feet over the runway. It then began a right turn away from the runway and had descended to 900 feet when the instructor stated that they were doing another 360-degree circuit. There were no further transmissions from the airplane, but there were two more radar returns, one at 900 feet, and the last at 600 feet in the right turn. About that time, a number of witnesses heard the engine \u201csputter,\u201d but then all witnesses subsequently heard the engine power up. They then saw the airplane descend at a steep angle and impact an aircraft parking apron, coming to a stop in about 600 feet.Because of a postcrash fire, not all engine items could be extensively examined. Those that could, did not reveal any engine anomalies, except that one fuel injector was found completely blocked, while another was partially blocked, most likely due to thermal effects from the fire. Propeller ground scars indicated power at the time of ground impact. The engine had over 2,380 hours of operation since its last overhaul, and another pilot reported that he had an engine failure while overflying an outlying airport about 12 months earlier, which maintenance personnel could not duplicate. During that failure, the engine did not sputter, and it could not be restarted, either in flight or on the ground until the following day. No subsequent engine operating anomalies were noted.Radar and wreckage path evidence indicated the likelihood that neither pilot adequately monitored the airplane\u2019s airspeed, which resulted in a right-turning aerodynamic stall. One pilot then attempted a recovery by adding power; however, by the time he did so, there was insufficient altitude to avoid the ground. The reason for the pilots\u2019 distraction from monitoring airspeed cannot be definitively determined; whether related to the power-off approach, the sputtering engine, or something altogether different.

The airplane, which had been receiving flight following, then collided with upsloping mountainous terrain in a mountain pass while in controlled flight after encountering instrument meteorological conditions. The controller terminated radar services due to anticipation of losing radar coverage within the mountainous pass area, and notified the pilot to contact the next sector once through the pass while staying northwest of an interstate highway due to opposing traffic on the south side of the highway.  The pilot later contacted the controller asking if he still needed to remain on a northwesterly heading.  The controller replied that he never assigned a northwesterly heading.  No further radio communications were received from the accident airplane.  Radar data revealed that while proceeding on a northeasterly course, the airplane climbed to an altitude of 6,400 feet mean sea level (msl).  A few minutes later, the radar data showed the airplane turning to an easterly heading and initiating a climb to an altitude of 6,900 feet msl.  The airplane then started descending in a right turn from 6,900 feet to 5,800 feet msl prior to it being lost from radar contact about 0.65 miles southeast of the accident site.  A weather observation station located at the departure airport reported a scattered cloud layer at 10,000 feet above ground level (agl).  A weather observation system located about 29 miles southwest of the accident site reported a broken cloud layer at 4,000 feet agl.  A pilot, who was flying west bound at 8,500 feet through the same pass around the time of the accident, reported overcast cloud coverage in the area of the accident site that extended west of the mountains.  The pilot stated that the ceiling was around 4,000 feet msl and the tops of the clouds were 7,000 feet msl or higher throughout the area. Postaccident examination of the airframe and both engines revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.",

With the helicopter at flat-pitch operating rpm and just as the pilot reached to adjust the VOX, the helicopter began oscillating due to ground resonance. Within 5 seconds of touchdown, the oscillating became severe. The pilot ensured that the collective was at flat pitch, and he rolled the throttle to flight idle. Within 15 seconds, the main rotor blades impacted the ground, tail boom, and other helicopter components. During postaccident examination, all four main landing gear dampers failed load stroke tests. The helicopter\u2019s maintenance records indicated that the main landing gear dampers were serviced by charging them with nitrogen in accordance with the helicopter\u2019s maintenance manual about 1 month before the accident. However, about 14 days before the dampers were serviced, the helicopter manufacturer had issued an alert service bulletin (ASB) that recommended a one-time load stroke inspection of the landing gear dampers to be performed at an overhaul or repair facility to ensure that the dampers were serviced correctly. Concurrently, the helicopter manufacturer had issued a revision to the maintenance manual that added a load stroke inspection procedure to the section of the manual pertaining to repair and charging of the dampers. The company\u2019s maintenance manager reported that maintenance personnel were unaware that the ASB and maintenance manual revision had been issued until after the accident. If the load stroke inspection of the dampers called for by the ASB or the maintenance manual revision had been performed, it would have identified the out-of-specification condition of the dampers before reinstallation. Because the dampers were out-of-specification, ground resonance occurred after the pilot landed the helicopter.",

The PIC was a recently retired airline pilot and had not flown general aviation airplanes for a number of years.  Witnesses reported hearing the aircraft engine and seeing the airplane descending straight into the trees.  One witness reported the airplane went \"straight up or tried to\" prior to descending.   Another witness reported seeing the airplane \"twist\" a little prior to it descending.  The accident site was in a heavily wooded area which was surrounded by open fields.

            "narrative": "On August 7, 2015, about 1855 eastern daylight time, an experimental amateur built Kitfox Model 1, N428YT, was substantially damaged when it impacted an embankment while practicing landing approaches to a private airstrip in Montrose, Pennsylvania. The airplane was owned and operated by a private individual. The private pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the personal flight. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 and originated around 1830 from Tri Cities Airport (CZG), Endicott, New York.According to a witness, the accident flight was the first time the pilot had performed practice landing approaches to his private airstrip. Immediately prior to the accident, the pilot performed about three practice approaches but had not landed the airplane. During the final approach, the airplane entered a \"steep angle turn\" and impacted an embankment about 15 feet short of the runway approach end.According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the experimental amateur-built airplane was issued a special airworthiness certificate on August 14, 2012, and registered to the pilot/owner. The airplane was a two-seat, high-wing, fabric covered monoplane equipped with fixed conventional landing gear and a Rotax 532 two-stroke engine.The airplane impacted an embankment and was oriented on a 025 degree heading. The airplane came to rest in a near nose down, vertical attitude. A post impact fire ensued, which consumed the fabric covering the fuselage, inboard section of both wings, and the empennage. All components of the airplane were located in the vicinity of the wreckage. In addition, a smell similar in odor to 100LL fuel was noted on scene in the vicinity of the wreckage.The right wing remained attached to the fuselage and was bent forward. The outboard section of the right wing was impact separated. The left wing remained intact and attached to the fuselage by the forward attach point and the wing strut was bent aft. The aft attach point of the left wing was thermally damaged and the wing tip exhibited crush damage in the aft direction. The empennage remained attached to the fuselage and was bent to the left about one foot forward of the elevator. The rudder and elevator skin was consumed by post impact fire and the control surfaces remained attached to the empennage at all attach points. The cockpit and seats were consumed by fire. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the flight control surfaces to the controls in the cockpit.The engine remained attached to the fuselage through the four engine mounts and engine control cables. It was removed from the airframe to facilitate examination. The spark plugs were finger tight and exhibited normal wear when compared to manufacturer guidance. The propeller reduction gear box was removed and contained oil. There were two teeth that were damaged from the propeller drive gear. In addition, there were three teeth damaged on the crankshaft gear. The exhaust \"y\" pipe was removed to examine the sides of the pistons, which did not exhibit any vertical scoring. Crankshaft and valvetrain continuity was confirmed when the crankshaft was rotated by hand. Both carburetors were impact-separated and consumed by fire. The starter was removed and partially melted and starter drive gear teeth were examined with no anomalies noted. The fuel lines and ignition wiring were consumed by fire. The accessory gear cover was consumed by post impact fire. The gascolator bowl was impact separated and consumed by fire. The radiator was impact separated and partially consumed by fire.",

The airplane (a unique test bed) had a known speed-dependent tendency to roll right which was attributed to wing and aileron twist deviations.  As the speed increased during the accident flight, the pilot had to apply full left aileron to be able to maintain airplane control.  The airplane completed the test point about 30-degrees right-wing-low, and subsequently began to roll to the right, \"like a barrel roll...not real fast,\" that the pilot reported he could not stop.  Although the manufacturer\u2019s engineering analysis (which did not include any high-speed wind tunnel testing) predicted positive lateral stability up to Mach 0.90, lateral control was lost during the accident flight, and the airplane rolled about 7 times during a 49-second timeframe, from about 30,500 feet until a near-vertical ground impact.  A review of telemetry data revealed that, just before the rolls began, the airplane's elevator moved to the 3.5 degrees trailing-edge-up (TEU) position, and the airplane's heading deviated right.  Less than 1 second later, the rudder moved from 2 degrees trailing-edge-left (TEL), to 6.5 degrees TEL, and the combination of the TEU elevator and the left rudder input coincided with a marked increase in airplane's right deviation.   Elevator-up deflection and rudder-left defection were maintained, with some variation in magnitude, to nearly the end of the data.  Because the known speed-dependent tendency to roll right had created significant control problems on a previous flight, the ailerons were removed, modified and replaced, and a Gurney flap was added to the right wing.  After the addition of the Gurney flap, the lateral trim margin improved to about 40 percent required (where 50 percent was neutral) up to 305 KCAS.  It was then determined that flutter testing could continue to higher airspeeds if the pilot needed to apply a \"small\" wheel force to augment the trim.  The pilot had been instructed to reduce airspeed if there was a problem during the flutter testing, and had done so during an uncommanded roll to the left on the previous flight.  Telemetry data from the accident flight revealed that at initiation of the upset, the pilot attempted to level the wings and raise the nose, but the airplane continued to diverge from stable flight, and it continued to accelerate beyond the airplane\u2019s demonstrated flight diving speed. It is undetermined if the pilot could have reduced the speed of the airplane in time, during the initiation of the upset, so that the airplane would not diverge.  After the accident, the company conducted high-speed wind tunnel tests, and found that lateral stability decreased with increasing Mach and angle of attack (AOA).  Lateral stability became negative (unstable) above Mach 0.83, and rudder input intended to augment lateral trim above a certain Mach could aggravate the situation.  In addition, a TEU elevator input would increase AOA, and also result in deteriorated lateral stability.  High speed wind tunnel data also revealed that roll authority deteriorated above Mach 0.86, and by Mach 0.88, the aileron upper and lower surfaces were both in separated flow regions.  The follow-on flutter test airplane, which successfully completed the certification requirements, was equipped with vortex generators and thicker trailing-edge ailerons.  It also did not require the external trim device needed on the accident airplane due to improvements in manufacturing.",

According to the flight crew, and confirmed by the FDR, the approach to landing was uneventful. Upon landing the pilot deployed the thrust reversers and the left main landing gear collapsed. Fracture of the main fitting for the left main landing gear was caused by a fatigue crack that emanated from multiple origins at the external surface of the wall at the shock strut radius run out area. No evidence of material anomalies, such as corrosion or gouge damage, was found at the fatigue origin area. Because the stresses leading to the fatigue crack of the main fitting have not clearly been identified, the root cause of the fatigue cracking has not been determined.  During the investigation, Atlantic Southeast Airlines did a Fleet Wide inspection of all their Bombardier Inc., Model CL600-2B19 aircraft landing gear assemblies, which included visual and eddy current inspections. Their inspections found no additional cracked landing gear. Additionally, Transport Canada issued a revised AD, which eliminated the escalation of the eddy current inspection intervals as allowed in their previous AD. Also, the FAA issued an NPRM in response to Transport Canada AD, which requires repetitive detailed visual and eddy current inspection of the main landing gear main fitting. The NPRM if adopted would produce another AD that is applicable to certain Bombardier Model CL600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. The proposal would require repetitive detailed and eddy current inspections on the main fittings of the main landing gears (MLG) to detect discrepancies, and related investigative/corrective actions if necessary. The proposal also requires servicing of the shock strut of the MLGs; inspection the shock strut of the MLGs for nitrogen pressure, visible chrome dimension, and oil leakage; and servicing any discrepant strut. Transport Canada has also accepted Messier-Dowty\u2019s redesign of the main fitting, on condition that the testing of the new design would be completed successfully. The testing is scheduled to commence in July 2004. Once the testing is completed Transport Canada will mandate the installation of the new design of the main fitting as the terminating action for the AD's.",

The pilot attempted a forced landing to a nearby airport, however, the airplane touched down in a field short of the runway.  The engine had accumulated 265.5 hours since factory remanufacture.  During examination of the engine, the number 3 connecting rod was found separated from the crankshaft.  The number 4 piston exhibited a hole burned through the crown structure of the piston.  The hole was located along a crack that extended across the top of the piston, in-line with the piston pin. Metallurgical examination determined that fatigue cracking of the piston initiated from a stamp mark \"4\" on the top surface of the piston.  The stamp mark, which was made by the manufacturer during engine buildup, acted as a stress raiser and was responsible for initiation of the crack.  Once the crack extended to the interior surface of the piston, hot combustion gasses created the burn through hole and escaped into the crankcase, leading to engine failure.  The accident airplane had experienced a previous in-flight engine failure in which an engine teardown revealed a piston with a burned through hole in the crown structure of the piston.  This engine had accumulated 640 hours since factory remanufacture; however, this piston did not have any stamp marks on its top surface.  The Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) gauge, thermocouple, and probes were removed from the accident airplane, and the thermocouple leads were found spliced in two locations.  According to the aircraft's maintenance manual, faulty thermocouple leads should be replaced.  They should never be spliced, as this will change the resistance of the leads, which is critical for the proper operation of the TIT gauge.  The pilot stated that he followed the leaning procedure in the airplane's operating handbook and leaned the engine by referencing the TIT gauge. ",

The method for testing the low-level fuel light and the lack of a vacuum check were not in accordance with the maintenance manual and the helicopter manufacturer\u2019s service bulletin relating to the start pump installation. Postaccident examination of the helicopter also revealed a nonstandard installation of an engine mounted fuel filter petcock drain valve.No written company procedures and/or fueling records were available that required pilots to track fuel loading and time-based fuel consumption in order to determine time remaining for flights and their termination. The pilot stated that he would have the helicopter refueled when the fuel gauge indicated about 100 lbs. However, had the operator and/or pilot calculated the flight time remaining based on known fuel quantities that were independent of fuel gauge indications, then any fuel gauge inaccuracies would be have become apparent. ",
            "probable_cause": "The improper maintenance of the helicopter fuel system that resulted in erroneous fuel gauge indications and the pilot\u2019s inadequate fuel management, both of which resulted in fuel exhaustion during a long-line hover. Also causal was the lack of company procedures to ensure adequate maintenance and fuel planning."

The commercial pilot in the airplane and the glider pilot in the glider were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for either airplane as they departed on the glider-tow flight of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.In a written statement, the pilot of the tow plane said that during the takeoff roll, with the glider in tow, he noticed fuel spraying on the windscreen. He estimated the airplane had used about 40 percent of the runway and was still on the ground, and that enough runway remained for both aircraft to abort the takeoff. When he aborted the tow, he announced his intention over the radio, and turned the airplane to the right in order to clear the runway for the glider behind. The tail section separated from the glider before it came to rest upright off the side of the runway. The pilot of the glider was interviewed briefly by telephone by both the FAA and NTSB, and provided a similar accounting of events. He said that when the takeoff was aborted, he turned to the right, but was unable to clear the towplane in front of him, as it also turned to the right and into the glider's path.The towplane pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for glider, airplane single-engine land and sea, multiengine land, and instrument airplane. His most recent FAA third class medical certificate was issued April 21, 2014. He reported 5,705 total hours of flight experience, of which 600 hours were in the accident airplane make and model. The glider pilot held Canadian glider-pilot and medical certificates. He estimated that he had 1,000 total hours of flight experience, all of which was in gliders, and 482 hours of which were in the accident glider make and model. The 1251 weather observation at Montpellier, Vermont (MPV), 13 miles east of 0B7 included an overcast layer at 8,500 feet, 10 miles visibility, and variable winds at 4 knots.The glider was recovered and taken to Canada by its owner. Examination of photographs and written descriptions of the damage by the two pilots and a certificated airframe and powerplant mechanic revealed the tail section was separated from the glider, and \"propeller slash marks\" were visible in the left wing. The right wing tip was of the towplane was visibly damaged, and the mechanic reported visible damage to the right wing spar.Both pilots reported that there were no mechanical anomalies with either airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The towplane pilot reported to the FAA that the airplane had been serviced with fuel prior to takeoff, and that fuel spilled during the servicing was what found its way onto his windscreen during the takeoff.

The Cessna was maneuvering northwest of the airport, and the Cirrus was descending toward the airport from the northwest. The air traffic controller working the flight cleared the Cirrus for a visual approach and advised the pilot to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency. About 2 minutes and 30 seconds before the collision, the controller advised the Cirrus of an aircraft (the Cessna) at his one o'clock position and 10 miles at 9500 feet mean sea level (msl). The Cirrus pilot responded, \"thank you,\" and there was no further contact with the Cirrus. Radar data indicates that for the next 2 minutes, the Cessna maintained a northeasterly heading and climbed to 9,800 feet msl. About 30 seconds before the collision, the Cessna turned approximately 20 to 30 degrees right and continued on that heading, level at 9,800 feet msl.

Based on the radar data, the system, if turned on, should have generated both an oral and visual traffic advisory starting about 30 seconds before and continuing until impact. It could not be determined whether the unit generated an advisory.

According to the instructor pilot, when he saw that the aircraft was going to lift off prematurely, he commanded the student to lower the nose. But, the student did not lower the nose enough, and the instructor did not apply forward pressure to the central control pedestal to keep the aircraft from lifting off too early. It was later discovered that the left wing had impacted the asphalt surface when the aircraft dropped back onto the runway. ",

After 1 hour, the pilot returned to the airport to pick up a different banner for the second hour of the flight. The pilot\u2019s first pick-up attempt was unsuccessful. He then briefly circled the pick-up location and then completed the pick-up on the second attempt. During the initial climb, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot released the banner and conducted a forced landing to a saltwater bay. Postrecovery examination of the fuel tanks revealed that the right main and auxiliary tanks were full of fuel and contained some saltwater. The left auxiliary tank was full of fuel and contained some saltwater, and the 18-gallon left main tank was empty and dry and contained no traces of either fuel or water. The pilot reported that the entire flight was conducted on the left main fuel tank. During a subsequent test run using the fuel that was onboard the airplane at the time of the accident, the engine operated with no anomalies or malfunctions.Interpolation of fuel consumption chart data revealed that the engine could consume between 7 and 10 gallons per hour (gph) during cruise flight and, according to an engine manufacturer representative, it could consume up to 21 gph during a full-power climb. According to the pilot, the engine power loss occurred during the fifth climbout of the flight. According to the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook, the fuel selector should be placed on the fullest tank before descent.

The private pilot had flown to Denver for a business trip and was receiving instrument flight instruction during the trip. A member of the private pilot's family stated that the airplane was returning to Wisconsin and was stopping at KIRK for fuel when the accident occurred. The airplane was cleared for the global positioning system (GPS) 18 approach and had been issued a frequency change to the common traffic advisory frequency at KIRK. Personnel at KIRK stated the pilot of N408DM checked in on the frequency, and was given the wind and altimeter information.

Among three machined grooves, located on the spindle under a spacer, the fatigue initiated in the groove located closest to the blade (the outboard groove).  Fatigue initiated at a single origin associated with a shot-peen pit. Circumferential scratches were observed in the groove areas and on the adjacent journal surface; however, the fatigue crack origin was not associated with these scratches.  The journal diameter was also undersize by 0.007 inch, and fretting was observed on the journal surface. The origin was not associated with any particular scratch or other apparent material defect.  The groove peak between the middle and inboard grooves was sheared at the trailing side of the red spindle and displaced toward inboard, damage consistent with a tail rotor strike.  The total time of the spindle could not be determined as it was not a life-limited component that required serial number and time tracking.  The tail rotor assembly underwent an overhaul about 233.6 hours prior to the accident.  During the overhaul, the spindles are to be inspected via fluorescent penetrant; however, the overhaul manual did not require the removal of the spacer that covered the groove area where the fatigue cracking initiated unless the spacer was damaged or worn beyond its approved limits.  According to the operator, the spacer was not routinely removed at overhaul unless it was damaged or out of dimensional tolerance.",

About 44 minutes into the flight, the airplane began descending after a course reversal to the south on the return for landing.  The pilot entered the landing pattern, however, due to multiple airplanes in the traffic pattern he extended downwind, and asked the controller in the air traffic control tower to call his turn to base leg.  After getting established on a 3-mile final, the controller notified the pilot that the airplane appeared low. The pilot responded that he was having engine problems and would try to make it to the runway.Witnesses reported that the airplane was low on final approach and that the engine was sputtering and backfiring. The airplane subsequently collided with a building  short of the runway.Postaccident examination of the wreckage found an engine monitoring unit on board. A download of the data indicated normal readings until the return descent where it appeared the pilot didn't enrich the mixture.  As the pilot was turning onto the base leg, data on the engine monitoring system indicated that the engine revolutions per minute (rpm) started a gradual decrease, and the exhaust gas temperatures (EGT) for all six cylinders became erratic. The EGTs for cylinders one, two, and six dropped slightly, and stayed at higher values than the other cylinders. When the EGTs became erratic, the engine was likely losing combustion (power) in some cylinders. During the postaccident engine examination, the mixture lever was found loose on the throttle shaft but it could not be determined if it was functioning properly at impact.  The reason for the partial loss of power could not be determined.",

The pilot estimated a total flight time en route of 2 hours 38 minutes, with the total fuel on board equating to 4 hours 53 minutes.  While in traffic pattern, the engine experienced a loss of power and the pilot declared an emergency.  A witness stated that he noticed the accident airplane flying low and the propeller appeared as though it was not producing power.  Fueling records at the departure airport disclosed that the aircraft was last fueled immediately prior to departure with the addition of 45 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel.  According to the pilot, the addition of the fuel filled the aircraft tanks to a total of 90 gallons (45 in each tank).  The fueler was contacted several days after the accident.  He indicated that he did not fill each tank to the maximum capacity, rather he evenly distributed the 45 gallons of fuel to each side.  Each wing's total fuel capacity was 54 gallons, of which 3 gallons were unusable.  Each wing was equipped with a fuel quantity sight gage that reads within the calibrated area of 25 to 30 gallons.  The right wing was impact damaged with numerous perforations.  The inboard fuel bladder was drained via the bottom sump and found to have about 1 gallon of fuel.  The left wing was separated from the fuselage.  Removal of the inspection panels on the left wing revealed that the fuel bladders were intact.

The pilot stated that both engines started normally. They taxied to the runway and used the checklist to perform an engine run-up on both engines. The pilot said the engine run-up was normal. He then lined the airplane up on the runway, applied full power to each engine (red line is 2,700 rpm), and departed. Once airborne, the pilot initiated a right turn. The pilot said that, when the airplane was at an altitude of between about 1,200 and 1,400 feet, he brought the propeller controls back to 2,500 rpm and left the power on both engines at 30 inches of manifold pressure. The mixture controls remained full forward. Almost immediately after reducing the rpm, the pilot heard a \u201cfaint\u201d and indistinguishable \u201cpop\u201d from the left engine. Both engines simultaneously went from \u201cfull power\u201d to idle, but the manifold pressure remained at 30 inches. The pilot said he made an immediate turn back to the runway and landed gear-up on the grassy area adjacent to the departure runway threshold. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed only minor damage to the right wing, left horizontal stabilizer, and fuselage. The propeller blades also exhibited slight twisting, which was consistent with them rotating at the time of impact. Several slash marks made by the propellers were observed in the grass where the airplane made the forced landing. The measured distance between these marks was consistent with both engines operating between 1,570 and 1,890 rpm at the time the propellers contacted the ground. Data from the onboard engine monitor, which recorded exhaust gas temperature (EGT), cylinder head temperature (CHT), and turbocharger turbine inlet temperature on each engine, were downloaded and plotted. The data revealed that the left engine lost power several seconds before the right engine. A rise in EGT was observed at this time as well. According to the engine manufacturer, if the mixture control were leaned, it would have decreased the mechanical fuel pumps\u2019 fuel flow and might have caused the smooth rise in EGT. However, the CHT continued to climb for several seconds after the decline of EGT on both engines. The data also indicated that the EGT appeared to rise again slightly before the data ended. The pilot reported that he did not move the mixture control at any time during the short flight. Due to the engine monitor\u2019s limited parameters (no rpm or fuel flow data), a conclusive cause for the power loss could not be determined. Examination of the airplane\u2019s fuel, electrical, and flight control systems revealed no preincident mechanical deficiencies that would have led to a loss of engine power. Both engines were examined then test run on the airframe using the airplane\u2019s fuel system. No mechanical deficiencies were identified that would have contributed to a loss of engine power.",

The pilot did not report the nature of the calibrated instrument, nor how it was calibrated to the aircraft fuel system.  On takeoff the fuel selector valve was set to the left tank and shortly after takeoff he switched it to the right tank.  He ran the right tank dry and when the engine quit, he switched to the left tank and began a circling descent to the airport.  The engine ran approximately 5 more minutes and then lost power again.  Attempts to restart the engine were unsuccessful.  The pilot reported that prior to the accident the aircraft was running normally and no deficiencies were noted.  The pilot reported to an FAA inspector that he had technically ran out of fuel.  The inspector examined the aircraft on scene the day of the accident and reported that the fuel system appeared to be intact and no fuel was present in either of the tanks.  According to the inspector no other mechanical anomalies were noted with the aircraft. ",

The typical route through the pass required making multiple turns, and the pass intersected with a box canyon. A family member reported the airplane overdue for arrival, and an alert notice was issued. The airplane\u2019s wreckage was located the following day at the bottom of the box canyon. A pilot who flew through the mountain pass on the morning of the accident reported 4,400-foot ceilings, severe turbulence, and flat light conditions. A friend of the pilot who attempted to cross the mountain pass the day of the accident reported flat light conditions and having difficulty discerning terrain features. He turned the airplane around due to the weather conditions and returned to the airport. He also stated that the accident pilot had become disorientated the previous year while flying a helicopter through the same mountain pass and had taken the wrong route. A postaccident examination revealed no evidence of a mechanical malfunction or failure with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. Given the lack of mechanical anomalies, the reported weather conditions, and the pilot statements, it is likely that the accident pilot mistakenly entered the box canyon thinking it was his route. Additionally, wreckage impact signatures and GPS data indicated that it is likely that the pilot was attempting to avoid rising terrain by entering a steep bank turn, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.",

The controller instructed the pilot to fly heading 340 degrees to intercept the localizer course for an instrument landing system approach.  At that time, the helicopter was about 1.5 miles from the localizer centerline, headed 095 degrees, about 150 knots groundspeed.  Consequently, the helicopter flew through and ended up well east of the 322-degree localizer course.  During the resulting 135-degree turn to rejoin the final approach course, the pilot was issued an approach clearance, but told to \"maintain 4,000.\"  The helicopter's track approached the runway centerline, and then turned sharply away from, and to the right of the inbound course.  The track showed an approximate heading of 100 degrees, when the radar target disappeared.  During the 1 minute and 10 seconds following the pilot's acknowledgement of the 4,000-foot altitude assignment, the helicopter descended only 300 feet, slowed to approximately 65 knots groundspeed, and turned 140 degrees right of course.  At the point where the helicopter re-intercepted the localizer, the autopilot was capable of capturing the localizer, but incapable of capturing the glideslope.  If altitude hold remained engaged at that point of the flight, and the pilot reduced collective to initiate a descent, the autopilot would adjust pitch in an effort to maintain the selected altitude.  Similar scenarios in helicopters and flight simulators have resulted in unusual attitudes and zero airspeed descents to the ground.  The pilot had accrued 9,616 total hours of flight experience.  He had 100 total hours of instrument flight experience; of which 10 hours was simulated instrument flight experience.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical anomalies.

The pilot stated that after losing power he initiated a forced landing to an open field approximately 1/4 mile short of the runway.  The airplane encountered rough/uneven terrain during the landing sequence and sustained substantial damage to the wing assembly.  The accident flight was the aircraft's second flight after being topped off with fuel.  The first flight commenced on November 13, however, due to deteriorating weather conditions the pilot returned to the departure airport approximately 45 minutes after departure.  The aircraft was not refueled prior to the accident flight.  The pilot reported the flight took longer than expected due to higher than forecasted headwinds. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate in-flight planning by failing to refuel while en route which resulted in fuel exhaustion and loss of engine power while on approach to the airport.  Rough/uneven terrain was a factor."

The witnesses stated that the airplane was in level flight when the nose pointed down steeply 45-90 degrees, and then started to transition up. Just after the nose went above the horizon, the right wing folded upward. The engine then lost power and the airplane entered into a free fall. A post accident examination of the wreckage revealed that the fracture surface of the wing spar were consistent with overload forces being applied to the airframe. The pilot did not hold a pilot or medical certificate. Post-mortem toxicology testing on the pilot was consistent with use of methamphetamine, marijuana, and diazepam, but there was no urine or blood available for testing; therefore, it was not possible to estimate the last time when the substances might have been used or whether the pilot may have been impaired by that use.
