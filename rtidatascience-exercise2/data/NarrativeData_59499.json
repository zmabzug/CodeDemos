The 1,295-hour instrument rated flight instructor and student pilot were fatally injured.  The flight originated under visual flight rules (VFR).  While airborne the pilot observed lightning in the distance and called a Flight Service Station, via the radio, inquiring if there were any weather radar returns between their present position and their intended destination.  The flight specialist responded that there was some scattered thunderstorm activity along their route and suggested the pilot deviate north in an attempt to avoid them.  The flight specialist further informed the pilot of an AIRMET in effect for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) along their route of flight, with VFR flight not recommended, and that their destination airport was reporting a broken ceiling at 600-feet above ground level (AGL).  The pilot acknowledged, filed, and activated an IFR flight plan to their destination via a northern route.  The pilot was in communications with two Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) during the flight.  A review of ARTCC communications with the accident airplane revealed that the pilot was not provided with any weather advisories nor was he advised of the radar-depicted weather displayed on the controller's scope.  According to recorded display system information, adverse weather was located along the accident airplane's flight path.  The airplane entered the depicted weather while at 8,000-feet.

The airplane appeared to slow down as it made a right turn followed by a descending spin until impacting the runway. The main wing tanks had been topped off about 1 week before the accident by another pilot. The pilot reported that he taxied the airplane to the hangar with the fuel selector valve in the right tip fuel tank position per standard operating procedures for the airplane. The pilot stated that a small amount of fuel was in the tip tank; however, the exact quantity was not able to be determined. Postaccident on-site examination of the wreckage revealed that the fuel tank selector valve handle appeared to be in the right tip fuel tank position. Based on detailed examination of the selector, and the nature of the cockpit structure deformation, it was later determined that the fuel tank selector valve was out of its detent and was actually between the Right Tip Tank and the Both Tip Tank selections. The fuel tank selector was probably moved out of the selector detent as a result of the crushing forces and structural deformation around the selector handle during the impact sequence. The fuel tank selector valve assembly was disassembled and found to be operational. The approved airplane flight manual for the airplane indicated that the selector valve should be positioned on the left wing tank for starting.

Both edges of the airstrip dropped off into drainage ditches immediately beyond the edges of the pavement. There was a crosswind from the right, which was variable and gusty. The density altitude was over 7,300 feet. Witnesses stated the aircraft touched down two to three times during the landing, and the pilot appeared to have difficulty maintaining a straight path on the pavement. A photo showed the aircraft's right main gear at the edge of the pavement as it approached the end of the landing area. The witnesses said that close to the end of the landing area, the aircraft became airborne again, climbed about 20 to 75 feet above ground level, and started a left turn. The aircraft's left wing then dropped, and the aircraft crashed. The airstrip had a 60 to 80 foot high ridge along its west edge for its entire length, and there was a 361 foot hill about 1/3 mile beyond the end of the airstrip with higher mountainous terrain beyond the hill. Flap system components were found in the up position at the accident site; the aircraft's flaps-up/gear-up stall speed was 71 MPH at 20 degrees bank and 79 MPH at 40 degrees bank.

Another witness reported seeing the airplane flying just after takeoff at a low altitude and then hearing the engine shut off before the airplane went out of sight behind a stand of trees. Another witness reported seeing the airplane flying at a low altitude when it suddenly lost altitude and nose dived toward the ground. The twin-engine airplane\u2019s fuselage had two engines in tandem, one engine in front of the cabin and one engine behind the cabin. The airplane had retractable landing gear and a belly-attached cargo pod. Examinations of the rear engine\u2019s propeller blade assembly showed evidence that it was not producing power at impact. The front engine\u2019s propeller blade assembly showed evidence that it was producing power at impact. Examinations of the fuel distribution system revealed that the front engine fuel selector handle was set to the left tank. The front engine fuel selector valve was found between the \u201cleft tank\u201d and \u201coff\u201d positions. The rear engine fuel selector handle and valve were found in the \u201coff\u201d position; therefore, the rear engine was most likely starved of available fuel, which is consistent with the physical and witness evidence of a loss of power to the rear engine. Further, given the witness statement that both engines were running before departure, it is likely that the fuel selector was inadvertently moved to the \u201coff\u201d position during, or shortly after, takeoff.Detailed examinations of the airframe components and teardowns of both engines did not reveal any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have contributed to the accident. The Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook (POH) noted that the airplane\u2019s single-engine climb rate is reduced 15 feet per minute (fpm) with the belly cargo pod attached and 240 fpm when the gear is in transit. The actual weight of the airplane at the time of the accident could not be determined due to a lack of fuel and airplane empty weight information. A weight of 4,000 pounds, the lightest weight shown in the POH, was used for airplane performance calculations, which showed that, at the time of the accident, the airplane\u2019s single-engine climb rate with the belly cargo pod attached was about 99 fpm. Given that the main landing gear were likely in transit, the climb rate could have been reduced by as much as 240 fpm. In this condition, the airplane would not have been able to climb and the pilot would not have been able to maintain level flight.",

The airplane was pushed back during a period of moderate to heavy rain.  After pushback, the airplane was held on the taxiway for about 30 minutes while the rain continued.  Takeoff also occurred during a period of heavy rain. After leveling off at flight level 280, while in cruise flight, the \"AP TRIM IS LWD\" caution annunciator illuminated. The first officer disconnected the autopilot, and found the aileron controls to be \"stiff and binding.\" The captain then took control of the airplane, and also found the aileron controls to be stiff and binding. The captain applied \"light to moderate\" roll input and felt a snap. Aileron control then operated normally. The captain executed left and right turns with no additional problems or binding noted. The crew re-engaged the autopilot, and the flight continued to an uneventful landing.  On the same date, two other CL600 regional jets from the same airline also experienced aileron stiffness after taking off at the same airport and in similar weather conditions.  Both airplanes landed uneventfully.  One of the airplanes diverted to an alternate airport.  The investigation revealed that approximately 40 Bombardier CRJ CL-600-2B19  regional jets experienced in-flight aileron control stiffness after standing/taxiing in, or taking off during rainy conditions, then climbing to freezing temperatures.  When the jets descended to above-freezing temperatures, the aileron control stiffness ceased.  Testing revealed that aileron circuit binding occurred in the area of the Brake and Position Sensor Unit (BPSU) bay.  Typically, within the bay, horizontally-oriented pulleys in the aileron control circuit would seize, and the aileron cable, after being subjected to water soaking, would freeze to the pulley.  Water ingress to the bay most likely occurred via an aging self-contouring sealing pad on an access panel directly above the pulleys.  The horizontal orientation of the pulleys, which had been used without difficulty in transport category aircraft for over 20 years, and the dished cross section of the pulley face allowed the retention of water when the airplane was parked.  In addition, the drying of pulley grease over time, combined with water migration from rain, could temporarily allow the bearing to seize when the airplane reached altitude.  A test on a dry-bearing pulley revealed that when water was applied to the pulley face, it remained pooled until the pulley was moved, when it flowed into the bearing.  Prior to the incidents, the manufacturer had not issued specific instructions to inspect pulleys in the BPSU bay.  Subsequent service letters and airworthiness directives to inspect the pulleys, grease the aileron cables and replace aging and seized pulleys, resulted in over 60 seized and deteriorating pulleys being found fleet wide.  There have been no further aileron control stiffness events on aircraft which had undergone the new inspection/maintenance procedures. ",
            "probable_cause": "The manufacturer's failure to provide inspection criteria for the BPSU compartment aileron control pulleys, which resulted in eventual pulley corrosion, and subsequent control stiffness when seized pulleys and water-soaked aileron cables froze together at altitude.  Factors included leaking BPSU bay access panel seals, precipitation, and freezing temperatures."

The Cessna 170B, flown by a private pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, was transponder equipped squawking code 1200 and emitting Mode C altitude information.  The Cessna 170B had just descended from 7,500 feet msl and was leveling off at 3,000 feet on a magnetic heading of 322 degrees when the collision occurred.  The pilot of the Cessna 170B, whose engine was separated from the airplane as a result of the collision, was able to maintain control of the airplane and succeeded in making a forced landing to an open field.  The pilot of the Cessna 210J, also the sole occupant, was not emitting a transponder code, and therefore no altitude or other identifying information was available.  However, a radar target was observed to the left and on a collision course with the Cessna 170B, and is assumed to have been the Cessna 210J; there were no other aircraft observed in the immediate vicinity.  At 2036:11, the aircraft were approximately 3 1/2 nautical miles apart, the Cessna 210J oriented on a heading of north, while the Cessna 170B was on a magnetic heading of 309 degrees.  At 2036:34, both aircraft were still on their respective headings, however, their lateral separation had diminished by 3/4 of a mile; the airplanes were now 2 3/4 miles apart.  At 2036:58, lateral separation was reduced by 1/2 mile to 2 1/4 miles, and at 2037:22 lateral separation was further reduced to 1 1/4 miles.  At 0337:46, 24 seconds prior to the collision, radar data indicates the aircraft were separated by a lateral distance of approximately 3,300 feet.  Based on scratch marks and paint transfer signatures observed on both aircraft, as well as an estimated speed of the overtaking Cessna 210J being 150 knots and the GPS readout speed of the Cessna 170B of 113 knots, calculations revealed a closure speed of 41 knots, and a collision angle of 8 degrees.  A calculated convergence angle of 22 degrees was determined for the Cessna 210J and 150 degrees for the Cessna 170B.  It was concluded that based on the Cessna 210J's convergence angle and pilot's unobstructed forward field of vision, the Cessna 210J pilot should have been able to detect the presence of the Cessna 170B using normal visual scanning procedures consistent with visual flight rule (VFR) operations.

Examination of the aft pressure bulkhead by the manufacturer revealed metal discoloration and soot residue, and it was determined that there was structural damage to the aft pressure bulkhead due to a heat induced loss of material temper.  After the incident the operator inspected the aft equipment bay and identified a hydraulic line with a pinhole leak.  The stainless steel hydraulic line had a small crater like deformation with evidence of recast metal and a 0.005-inch hole at the base of the crater, which is consistent with damage caused by an electrical arc.  There was no evidence of chafing on the hydraulic line.  Copper, cadmium, and nickel material were acid rinsed from the crater; none of which are listed as alloying element in stainless steel.

Ground crews watching the helicopter make its drop run observed smoke emanating from the right engine, then the helicopter made a left descending turn and impacted the downsloping mountainous terrain.  A trailing pilot saw the helicopter about 150 feet above the ridgeline, then it made a sudden left descending turn.  He did not see the pilot jettison either the water or the bucket.  A teardown inspection and metallurgical examination of the No. 1 and No. 2 power sections was conducted.  The examination of the No. 1 power section CT disc revealed that the firtree serrations adjacent to the No.s 24 and 25 blade positions were fractured above the blade retaining rivet hole, and that the No.s 27-29 firtree serrations were fractured at the blade roots.  During the metallurgical examination, the failure of the CT disc was attributed to cyclic stress rupture due to extended and repeated operation of the engine at, near, or above its temperature/power limits.  Dimensional measurements of the blades showed growth and deformation to the disk in the areas of the fractures.  There were no material, manufacture, or design deficiencies identified during the metallurgical examination of the CT disc.  The examination of the No. 2 power section revealed that the intermediate drive shaft fractured in a counterclockwise direction due to sudden stoppage of the left engine while it was at a high power level.  Due to the degree of destruction and lack of dispatch records, the investigation was not able to accurately determine the operating weight of the helicopter at the time of the accident; however, for the 9,500-foot density altitude, it is believed that the helicopter's weight with the water load was at a point that resulted in marginal single engine capability at best. The accident helicopter had been modified with the installation of a water bucket and long line system.  The long line and water bucket circuit breakers, and the emergency electrical release, were connected to the nonessential bus.  This system was installed on a Form 337 field approval.  According to the helicopter manufacturer, the electrical system is designed so that if one generator and/or engine failed both of the nonessential buses would automatically drop offline.  Thus the emergency electrical release of the water bucket and long line would have been rendered inoperable in the event of a generator and/or engine failure.  An override switch on the electrical panel can restore power to the nonessential buses; however, based on the event timeline reported by the witnesses, it is unlikely that the pilot could have restored power to the nonessential busses in time to prevent a collision with the ground.",
            "probable_cause": "failure of the compressor turbine disc due to cyclic fatigue brought about by repeated operation near or above the engines' temperature/power limits by company personnel over an extended period of time.  Factors in the accident were:  1) the high density altitude, mountainous terrain, and the helicopter's resulting marginal single engine performance capability; 2) the design, fabrication, and installation of the emergency external load release system, which had the power supply wired to the nonessential bus that would automatically drop offline during an engine or generator failure; and 3) the pilot's resulting inability to electrically release the water load, bucket, or line while dealing with the engine failure."

The airline transport pilot and passenger were not injured. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the planned flight to Jack Edward Airport (JKA), Gulf Shores, Alabama. The flight originated from Demopolis Regional Airport (DYA), Demopolis, Alabama, about 1715.The pilot stated that during a cross-country flight, he stopped at DYA and added 30 gallons of fuel. About 15 minutes after departure, while cruising at 3,500 feet, the engine lost all power. The pilot utilized emergency procedures to restart the engine, but was unsuccessful. He then selected a field for an emergency landing due to utility wires surrounding the adjacent roads. The pilot also noted that there was an airport he had recently flown over, but it was behind him and he could not locate it. As such, he felt that the field was the best option for the forced landing. The touchdown was normal, but the field included rough terrain, which resulted in the nosegear collapsing before the airplane came to rest upright.Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed damage to the underside of the fuselage and an engine mount.Further examination of the engine was planned following its recovery from the field.",

The pilot did not immediately land at the approach end of the runway; instead, he continued to the departure end, where the passenger terminal was located. The helicopter approached the mid-point of the runway, and as it neared the surface, the dispatcher heard the pilot state, \"Okay we're done.\" Then, the sound of the rotor changed pitch and the helicopter impacted the ground. Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that the left lateral flight control servo became disconnected in flight at the transmission. Further examination revealed that the lower clevis of the left lateral servo was still attached to the transmission case, but was no longer attached to the servo. The threads on the clevis, as well as the threads on the inner diameter of the servo, appeared undamaged. The jam nut, lock nut washer, and safety wire were still attached to the clevis threads and rotated freely. The lock washer was severely worn and the locking tang was missing. Metallurgical testing and torque testing of the accident servos revealed that the jam nut, washer, and piston rod were able to easily rotate off of the clevis if no torque was applied and with the locking tang missing.   Under normal loads, the main hydraulic flight control servos experience slight twisting that could contribute to the servo rotating off the clevis bolt (without an intact and functioning locking washer installed).  Therefore, the investigation revealed that the servo attachment nut was not torqued during maintenance about one month prior to the accident, and the lack of torque, coupled with the installation of a severely worn lock washer, allowed the servo to rotate off of the clevis during the accident flight, resulting in a complete disengagement of the servo from its mounting clevis on the transmission. Examination of the company maintenance program revealed that none of the mechanics at the helicopter's base had received factory training, and that the maintenance manuals they used were three revisions out of date. Mandatory quality control inspections of maintenance actions, as well as post-maintenance test flights prescribed in the General Operator's Manual and the manufacturer's maintenance manuals (that included the replacement of the flight control servo), were not performed.(This report was modified on June 16, 2009)",

During the departure, the airplane encountered light to moderate rain, and, while climbing through about 28,000 feet, the crew found that the rudder was frozen in the neutral position. The crew continued the climb to 40,000 feet and, based on discussions with the company, diverted to an en route airport. Descending through 13,000 feet, normal rudder operation returned, and the subsequent approach and landing were uneventful. After the crew disembarked, they noticed water dripping from the belly of the airplane, and subsequently found ice in the bottom of the tailcone stinger, through which the rudder and elevator control cables ran. About 4 months prior to this incident, two other airplanes had similar incidents that resulted in the manufacturer issuing an alert service letter (ASL). The ASL stated, in part, that the tailcone stinger may not drain water, which could allow ice to form around the rudder cables and pulleys. The ASL required inspection of the two existing drain holes to ensure they were the right size, sealing an existing drain hole, and adding another drain hole in the aft canted bulkhead. This incident airplane had incorporated the ASL prior to the incident.Subsequent flight testing by the manufacturer revealed that, with the tailcone stinger drain hole sealed per the ASL, air could still enter the tailcone through seams at the bottom of the stinger with enough force to splatter water onto the rudder cables and pulleys, which could then freeze. Testing also revealed that air emanating from the new hole in the aft canted bulkhead also resulted in water splattering onto the rudder cables and pulleys and that, after large quantities of water were introduced, water would only drain forward through the new hole only if large quantities were introduced. As a result, the manufacturer issued a service bulletin, in addition to the ASL (which must be completed) that requires the installation of a seal and another drain.",

A review of the flight manifest for October 25 had the airplane airborne for 2 hours and 18 minutes, with the take-off at 1740 and landing Houston at 1958.  The airplane was equipped with two 40-gallon wing fuel tanks, with 37 gallons useable.  Additionally,  the operator planned for an 18-gallons/hour fuel burn during cruise flight, and 22-gallons/hour in a climb.  On October 26, the pilot departed approximately 16:40 for a 221 nautical mile flight.  During the flight, the pilot decided to return to the airport due to \"bad\" weather and moderate to heavy turbulence.  Approximately 40 minutes after departure, the \"engine quit\"; the pilot ran the checklist, which including switching fuel tanks (from the right to the left tank), turning on the [electric] fuel pump, applying full rich mixture and turning the magnetos; left, right and to both.  The engine did not restart and the pilot elected to land in a field.  During the forced landing the airplane's nose gear collapsed and the came to rest with the nose down.  The pilot reported that after the landing he looked in each fuel tank and observed, \" sufficient quantities of fuel.\"  The following morning, with the airplane still tipped up on it's nose an FAA inspector observed that the left fuel tank was empty and the right tank had \"about an inch\" of fuel in the tank.  During the airplane salvage retrieval, recovery personnel reported they drained 21 gallons of fuel from the right fuel tank and that the left tank contained approximately 1 quart of fuel.  Environmental personnel reported that \"no sheen or soil staining\" was observed in the area of the crash and no fuel was spilled in the airplane recovery.  The pilot reported to the NTSB IIC, that he visually checked the fuel level, and both tanks were at the three-quarter full level prior to the flight; on the NTSB form 6120.1 (Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report) he reported that he had 46 gallons of fuel on board and that he used approximately 1 gallon of fuel before departure.  The airplane was transported to a salvage yard and an airplane examination was conducted.  The fuel lines and vents were clear and unobstructed.  The two wing drain ports were undamaged with no evidence of any leakage.  Both wing fuel tanks were not breached in the accident sequence.  The engine's fuel servo fuel-screen was removed and was in good condition and absent of any debris. Other than a bent propeller, the engine did not appear to have sustained any impact damage during the accident.  The engine was fitted with a test propeller and a fuel container was attached to the fuel line on the left side of the airplane.  The engine's oil was checked and read as 11 quarts on the dipstick.  The airplane's electric fuel pump operated and was used to prime the engine.  The engine was then started and run for approximately 5 minutes.  The engine was then shutdown and the fuel container was switched and connected to the right side fuel line.  Again, the engine was started and run for approximately 5 minutes.   During the engine runs, the engine was run to full power, the oil pressure was normal, and the left-right magneto drop was between 50-60 rpm.

During the initial descent from 22,000 feet mean sea level (msl) to 14,000 feet msl, the trim wheel moved to the forward stop.  The trim wheel made a \"snapping\" motion midway through the movement, and then moved aft.  The trim wheel continued to move back and forth, so the crew disconnected the autopilot and trim.  The airplane wanted to pitch up, and the captain had to apply moderate forward pressure to maintain pitch control.  The trim wheel was still jammed, but one crewmember could control the airplane.  At 12,000 feet msl, and approximately 23 degrees Fahrenheit outside air temperature, the trim remained immovable.  Between 5,000 feet msl and 4,000 feet msl, the trim wheel became moveable.  By the time the airplane reached the traffic pattern altitude, the trim wheel moved freely.  The outside temperature at that time was 46 degrees Fahrenheit.  Examination of the elevator trim units revealed that one trim actuator had leaking shaft seals.  Its packing had cracked, and a bearing had seized. The second actuator was dirty, and minor corrosion was on the hardware.  The shaft seals leaked, and a rigging device was installed.  Service Difficulty Report (SDR) data from August 30, 1990, to February 29, 2000, contained 19 reports of the elevator trim freezing at altitude.

Some of the airplanes experienced multiple events.  During some of the events, the airplane pitched violently.  The manufacturer discovered moisture and corrosion in some of the actuators that were submitted for repair after these occurrences.  They suspected that leaking seals allowed moisture into the actuators, which froze at altitude.  They developed a modification that included installation of additional seals inside the actuator.

About 10 minutes after establishing radio and radar contact with ATC, the airplane's discrete transponder code was lost, and an air traffic controller made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the airplane. Postaccident review of radar data showed a primary target, correlated to be the accident airplane, as it tracked north toward the pilot's destination.

The pilot applied takeoff power and, based on his years of experience, he estimated that the engine was developing full power. The airplane became airborne in about the usual time, just before midfield. He began climbing out between 40 to 50 mph, which he said was normal; about 10 to 15 seconds later, when the airplane was about 100 feet above ground level and with about 1/4 of the runway remaining, the pilot noticed that the engine was not developing full power, which was usually 2400 rpm; the tachometer indicated 1,900 rpm. He verified that the throttle was full forward, the mixture control was full rich, and the carburetor heat was off. At 1,900 rpm, there was just enough power to maintain altitude but not enough to climb. The pilot initiated a shallow turn to try landing on a taxiway, but during the turn, he lost altitude and abandoned the plan. He maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing on a road. During the forced landing attempt, the right wing hit a tree, causing the airplane to be pulled to the right over a guardrail.

After a few minutes, he deactivated the electric fuel pump, and the fuel flow remained \u201cstable.\u201d The pilot began the descent from cruise altitude and selected the outboard fuel tanks on the fuel selector panel. During the descent, the right engine began to lose power, and it subsequently lost total power. After the pilot notified an air traffic controller of the engine failure and chose to continue to his original destination, the left engine lost total power. He then maneuvered the airplane toward a nearby airport; however, the airplane was unable to reach the airport, and it impacted trees and then came to rest upright. The airplane had been fueled 2 days before the accident and had been flown for an undetermined amount of time since then. Local law enforcement reported smelling fuel at the crash site; however, the investigation could not determine whether the selected fuel tanks had fuel in them when the engines lost power. Although on-scene examination of the fuel system revealed that fuel was present throughout the system except at the right engine fuel flow divider, it could not be determined what role, if any, this played in the loss of power to both engines.

The pilot attempted to regain control of the helicopter, and it eventually came to a stop upright on its skids facing about 160 degrees right of the runway centerline. The aft portion of the tail boom had separated. Postaccident testing and examination of the engine revealed a degraded power turbine (PT) governor spool bearing. Examinations also revealed the presence of diamond particles, which are used in the manufacturing process for the ball bearings, in the governor spool bearing. It is likely that diamond particle contamination caused the governor spool bearing to fail, which rendered the PT governor incapable of modulating governor servo pressure to the fuel control unit. Although no physical evidence was found indicating that the electronic overspeed system activated, the pilot\u2019s statement about two increases in rpm and then a decrease in rpm indicates that the system likely activated. The loss of PT governing ability coupled with the activation of the electronic overspeed system likely resulted in fuel flow oscillations that decreased the fuel flow below the lean blowout limit of the engine and led to the loss of engine power.",

However when she arrived at the FBO, he was not there.According to a mechanic, on June 19, 2015, the airplane had been ferried to 01NC on a ferry permit, as the pilot had previously been sick and could not fly the airplane somewhere to have the conditional inspection performed when it was due.On June 20, 2015, the mechanic along with another mechanic began the conditional inspection. On that date, the pilot advised the mechanics that he had accidently \"put oil\" into the coolant fill port on top of the engine because it looked low. The mechanic advised that the pilot was pretty upset about it. The mechanics then flushed the cooling system and added new coolant. The mechanics also noticed that the bushings holding the radiator on to the engine were cracked and broken and replaced them.The pilot advised them that the engine oil had been changed only 23 hours earlier and that the oil should not be changed. The mechanics then discovered that the spark plugs needed cleaning but after advising the pilot of the cost of new spark plugs, the pilot had them install new plugs instead of cleaning the old ones.The next day (day of the accident), the pilot arrived at the airport about 1030 and went home to get some rest, advising the mechanics that he would return about 1600. One of the mechanics advised him that they would leave the gate unlocked for him. At this time, the only thing still required to be done as part of the inspection was to open up all of the inspection panels on the airplane. This was accomplished, the inspection panels were then closed, and the airplane was returned to service at approximately 1400. The mechanics then locked up the hangar and went home.At 1711, one of the mechanics received a call from the airport owner who advised that he had received a telephone call from the pilot's wife and that the pilot had not arrived at OAJ and that he was probably was still at 01NC. The airplane however was not at 01NC. After looking around the area adjacent to the airport for the airplane without result, the mechanic called 911. Downed airplane procedures were then initiated, and then about 1900, a search for the airplane by federal, state, and local authorities was initiated.At approximately 2130, the wreckage of the airplane was discovered in a wooded area approximately 1.1 miles west of 01NC.Examination of the accident site revealed the airplane had struck trees in a steep nose low attitude and the pilot had been ejected from the cockpit. The airplane then fell nose first to the forest floor below, impacted in a 90 degree nose down attitude, nosed over, and then came to rest inverted.Examination of the wreckage revealed that the majority of the airplane's wreckage was present on-scene. Numerous areas of crush and compression damage and evidence of fuel staining on the leading edges of the wings were also present. There was no evidence of any inflight structural failure, inflight fire, or inflight explosion.Both wing fuel tank fuel caps were closed, both wing locker doors were closed and secured, all of the inspection panels were closed and secured, and the Pitot tube was clear and free of debrisThe wing flaps were in the up position, and flight control continuity was established from the ailerons, elevator, and rudder to the control stick and rudder pedals in the cockpit. The rudder trim was approximately neutral.The magneto switch was in the both position, the throttle was in the full throttle position, and the choke lever was in the off position. The fuel selector was in the right tank position. The carburetor heat control was in the off position. The pilot's four point harness was intact and attached to its attachment fittings however; the center buckle assembly was unlatched. The emergency locator transmitter had not been armed, and the ballistic recovery system activation handle safety pin was still in place.Examination of the propeller speed reduction unit (PSRU) revealed that it was impact damaged and the case had been breached. Examination of the propeller, the PSRU propeller gear assembly, and the PSRU overload clutch revealed evidence of rotation. Smearing was evident on the metal faces of the overload clutch. The propeller drive shaft was also sheared, displayed a 45 degree conical break at the shear face, and evidence of torsional rotation.Examination of the engine revealed that it was impact damaged, both carburetors had separated from their mounting locations and the float bowls had separated from the carburetors. Portions of the air intake system, exhaust system, and the ignition harnesses, had separated from their mounting positions.Examination of the cockpit canopy revealed that it was detached from its mounting location and was lying underneath the aft portion of the inverted fuselage. The majority of its clear bubble was broken into multiple pieces however, they were not scattered around the accident site but were instead collocated with the canopy frame. One of the canopy lift struts was also missing, and the damage patterns observed on the canopy frame and cockpit sill did not match and could not be correlated with each other. The canopy latching mechanism hooks were also found to be partially retracted, the canopy latching mechanism and activation handle were in the \"OPEN\" position and the slots in the canopy frame that the hooks engaged when the canopy was closed showed no evidence of tear-outs.The wreckage was retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

            "narrative": "On September 4, 2014, at 2010 Pacific daylight time, a Eurocopter AS 350 B3, N217HP, landed hard during a practice autorotation at Lincoln Regional Airport/Karl Harder Field, Lincoln, California. The helicopter was registered to, and operated by, the California Highway Patrol as a public-use, training flight. The commercial pilot and flight instructor (CFI) were not injured. The helicopter sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence. The local flight departed Auburn Municipal Airport, Auburn, California, about 1950. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.The purpose of the flight was to provide recurrent emergency procedure and night vision goggle (NVG) training for the pilot, who was positioned in the right seat. Prior to departure, the crew discussed the plans for the flight, and the pilot performed a preflight inspection. The decision was made to perform a full landing at Lincoln, followed by a practice autorotation with power recovery, and then once ambient light had diminished, transition into NVG training. Because they departed during daylight the pilot turned off the NVG unit's battery pack, and moved the goggles to the up position on his helmet.Both occupants recounted the circumstances of the accident, stating that once the startup and departure checklists were complete, the CFI performed a throttle check in preparation for the emergency maneuvers. With all systems nominal, they departed and the pilot performed an uneventful landing on runway 15 at Lincoln. They then departed to practice the autorotation on the same runway. The CFI asked the pilot to make his primary goal attaining the appropriate rotor and air speeds rather than focusing on a specific landing spot. Once they were both ready, the CFI rolled the left-side engine throttle to the idle (MIN) position to initiate the maneuver. The pilot lowered the collective and the helicopter descended; once they reached an altitude of about 50 feet above ground level, the pilot began to initiate the flare, with the CFI countering by rolling the throttle to the flight (VOL) position. They heard the engine respond along with an accompanying yaw motion, and the CFI announced \"power recovery.\"The pilot stated that he held the helicopter in the flare, and the rotor speed started to increase, so he pulled up lightly on the collective control to prevent an overspeed condition. The helicopter then \"ballooned\" slightly, and he lowered the collective to recover. The forward speed decayed, and he moved the helicopter forward in anticipation of the hover. As he started to raise the collective control, the low rotor speed horn sounded and the helicopter began to rapidly descend. He pulled up the collective in an effort to arrest the descent, and the helicopter hit the ground hard. His NVG goggles flipped down over his eyes, and because the battery pack was not turned on, his forward vision became effectively blocked. He then perceived forward and nose-low motion as the CFI took control of the helicopter. He felt the cyclic pull full aft, and the helicopter came to rest.Once on the ground the CFI pushed the collective control to the full down position, and confirmed the throttle was in the flight detent. The rotor speed indicator reported a speed below the green arc at 360 to 370 rpm, and the amber GOV and TWST GRP caution lights were still illuminated. He cycled the throttle to idle, and then back to flight, but the rotor speed would not exceed 370 rpm. He repeated the operation with no increase in rotor speed, and then reached over to unlock the flight gate on the right-side throttle control. The engine responded, and the rotor speed increased to 390 rpm, but the caution lights were still illuminated; he then twisted the throttle back out of the gate and into the flight position. He reached up to the overhead engine start panel and cycled the engine operation switch back to idle and then flight; the engine responded appropriately, and the caution lights finally extinguished. He then asked the pilot to shut down the engine.Subsequent examination revealed that the tailboom had bent downwards at its intersection with the aft bulkhead, just below the engine exhaust outlet. The aft bulkhead sustained wrinkling damage, and both aft landing skid support tubes were bent.",

During the approach to land with a quartering tailwind, the pilot used the collective to arrest the descent rate; however, after having used the full travel of the collective with no appreciable reduction in the descent rate, the helicopter landed in the soft ground, all four landing gear sank, and the helicopter rolled over and came to rest on its left side. No preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation. A nearby weather recording station recorded the wind about the time of the accident as being from the north-northwest at 12 knots, gusting to 16 knots. According to the pilot, the helicopter was moving forward at a speed of about 10 knots at touchdown.

He stated that he then added power to \"overcome the ground effect\" and land the airplane. The pilot's addition of power would have prolonged, not reduced, the float. The pilot then decided to abort the landing; he applied full power and retracted the flaps. An air traffic controller reported that during the attempted balked landing, the airplane reached an estimated altitude of 50 to 75 feet above ground level before it sank to and impacted the runway. In contrast, the pilot reported that he was 5 to 6 feet above the runway when the airplane sank. The airplane impacted the runway about midfield in a relatively level attitude, veered left, and struck a parked airplane. Ground scars and airplane damage indicated that the engine was developing power at ground impact. No pre-existing mechanical deficiencies or failures that would have precluded normal operation were observed. Performance data in the pilot\u2019s operating handbook indicated that for the ambient conditions the airplane should have been able to climb away with either full- or half-flaps, which is the specified balked landing flap setting. However, the flaps were found in the fully retracted position. Ground scars and airplane damage were consistent with a partial or full stall just above the runway, at an altitude likely higher than the pilot's estimate but lower than the altitude estimated by the controller. It is likely that the stall resulted from the pilot's premature retraction of the flaps at too low an airspeed, and his attempt to climb the airplane out of ground effect, as evidenced by the midfield initial impact location. The airplane's ability to climb out of ground effect was hampered by the improper flap setting.",
