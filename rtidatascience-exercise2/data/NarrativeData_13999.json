Postincident testing showed that off-axis deployment of the parachute could exceed the forces required for a successful deployment of the parachute. If the airplane has a large pitch or bank angle or angular rates (or a combination of these) as the parachute rocket leaves the airplane, the airplane will rotate and cause the rocket tether to pull at an angle other than that intended, and the parachute will fail to deploy.

The pilot had flown commercially from Illinois to Florida earlier that day and had been offered lodging by the owners on several occasions but declined. The airplane was not approved for night operations due, in part, to a lack of interior lighting. For over an hour after takeoff, on a clear, dark night, the airplane was headed northbound in straight and level flight at 6,500 feet. The pilot, who had been in contact with an air traffic control facility, had been told to switch to a new radio frequency; afterward radar contact was lost and there were no distress calls from the pilot. The airplane impacted wooded terrain and was mostly consumed by post-impact fire. All flight control surfaces were accounted for at the scene and no preexisting mechanical anomalies were found. There was no evidence of an in-flight fire and no evidence of the pilot attempting to use the whole-airplane ballistic parachute system. The pilot was found about 1/3 mile away from the wreckage, about 600 feet to the right of the airplane's radar track. Numerous personal items were also located to the right of the airplane's radar track, with heavier items generally closer to the track than the lighter items. Shards of bubble-canopy glass and the canopy frame were found at the airplane's impact site, but no shards were noted in the vicinity of where the pilot or the personal items were found, indicating that the canopy was likely unlatched and open when the pilot and the other items exited the airplane. Each seat of the two-seat airplane was equipped with a four-point restraint harness, with each harness having four identical belt adjusting mechanisms: two for the risers and two for the seatbelt portion of the harness. Except for a number of small pieces, both harnesses were almost entirely burned. One surviving piece, for adjusting either a riser or a seat belt portion of the harness, had distorted metal and pulled material, consistent with sudden, forceful loading. The top of the pilot's shoulders also exhibited bruising, indicative of a sudden loading while the harness risers were loosely in place. There were no marks on the pilot's frontal area to indicate that the seat belt portion of the harness was buckled at the time of the loading.Ground testing revealed that access to the back shelf behind the seats would have been difficult to reach if the pilot had not unbuckled the seat belt portion of his restraint harness and loosened the risers. Thus, it is likely that the pilot tried to reach something on the back shelf. Then, at some point afterward, the canopy T-handle likely became unlatched, possibly having been caught by a loose right harness riser or a looped headset wire that plugged in next to the canopy handle. With a dark, noisy cockpit, the pilot likely then inadvertently applied rapid control inputs that resulted right-rolling, negative g-forces of sufficient intensity to eject him and the other personal items.",

Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to fly at night in an airplane not approved for night flight, his unbuckling of the seat belt portion of the restraint harness, and the inadvertent opening of the airplane\u2019s canopy."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.On the day of the accident, a mechanic taxied the airplane onto the runway and performed a full power check of both engines, exercised both propellers, and checked each magneto drop with no discrepancies reported. Following the engine run, the mechanic taxied the airplane to the fuel ramp where the fuselage fuel tank was filled; after fueling, the fuselage tank had 41.5 gallons of usable fuel. The mechanic then taxied the airplane to the ramp where the engines were secured and the fuel selector switches were placed to the off position. The mechanic reported that, at that time, the left fuel tank had 4 to 5 gallons of fuel, while the right fuel tank had about 2 to 3 gallons of fuel; the unusable fuel amount for each wing tank is 3 gallons.The pilot taxied the airplane to the approach end of runway 18 and was heard to apply takeoff power. A pilot-rated witness noted that, at the point of rotation, the airplane pitched up fairly quickly to about 20 degrees and rolled left to about 10 to 15 degrees of bank. The airplane continued rolling left to an inverted position and impacted the ground in a 40 degree nose-low attitude. A postcrash fire consumed most of the cockpit, cabin, both wings, and aft fuselage, including the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and fuselage fuel tank.Postaccident inspection of the flight controls, which were extensively damaged by impact and fire, revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Although the flap actuators were noted to be asymmetrically extended and no witness marks were noted to confirm the flap position, a restrictor is located at each cylinder\u2019s downline port by design to prevent a rapid asymmetric condition. Therefore, it is likely that the flap actuators changed positions following impact and loss of hydraulic system pressure and did not contribute to the left roll that preceded the accident.Examination of the engines and propellers revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. Postaccident examination of the fuselage fuel sump revealed the left fuel selector was in the crossfeed position, while the right fuel selector was likely positioned to the on position. (The as-found positions of the fuel selector knobs were unreliable due to postaccident damage.) The starting engines checklist indicates that the pilot is to move both fuel selectors from the on position to the crossfeed position, and back to the on position while listening for valve actuation/movement. The before takeoff checklist indicates that the pilot is to verify that the selectors are in the on position. Although the left engine servo fuel injector did not meet flow tests during the postaccident investigation, this was attributed to postaccident heat damage. Calculations to determine engine rpm based on ground scars revealed that the left engine was operating just above idle, and the right engine was operating about 1,315 rpm, which is consistent with a left engine loss of power and the pilot reducing power on the right engine during the in-flight loss of control. Examination of both propellers determined that neither was feathered at impact.Although the as-found position of the left fuel selector knob could be considered unreliable because of impact damage during the accident sequence, given that right wing fuel tank had no usable fuel, it is unlikely that the experienced pilot would have moved the left fuel selector to the crossfeed position in response to the engine power loss. It is more likely that the pilot failed to return the left fuel selector to the on position during the starting engines checklist and also failed to verify its position during the before takeoff checklist; thus, the left engine was being fed only from the right fuel tank, which had very little fuel. There was likely enough fuel in the right tank and lines for the pilot to taxi and takeoff before the left engine failed, causing the airplane to turn to the left, from which the pilot did not recover.  ",

The airplane was being flown on its first flight after an annual inspection.  A cylinder was replaced, a turbocharger leak was fixed, and the right fuel bladder was removed, repaired, and reinstalled during the annual inspection.  The fuel from the removed fuel bladder was recovered, stored, and was returned to the bladder when it was reinstalled.  The airplane was also serviced with about 67 gallons of 100 low lead aviation gasoline.  The fuel in the airplane's fuel tanks were reported to have been checked by observing samples collected from the fuel sumps prior to the flight.  The airplane battery was low and external power was used to start the engine for the flight.  A replay of radar data showed the airplane was at 5,000 feet above mean sea level (MSL) and was traveling eastward at about 170 knots groundspeed when it checked on with approach.  About 1907, the radar data replay showed the airplane descending to 4,800 feet and its groundspeed slowing to 160 knots.  The air traffic controller issued the flight a descent clearance to 3,000 feet MSL.  The pilot responded back that he had an emergency, had lost engine power, had switched fuel tanks, and needed the closest airfield.  The pilot was given a heading of 360 degrees to an airfield.  While en route to the airfield, the pilot was asked if his engine was completely out and if he was gliding into the airport.  The pilot reported that was correct.  About 1910, the air traffic controller pointed out another closer airport.  No further response was received from the airplane.  The last recorded radar data was at 1910.  The radar showed the airplane was about 2 miles from the closer airport at 2,000 feet MSL and traveling northbound at about 80 knots groundspeed.  About 1918, the police department received notification of a downed aircraft.  The cabin area of the fuselage, left and right inboard fuel tank sections, and upper forward section of the empennage were destroyed by a post impact fire.  An on-scene investigation and follow up examinations revealed no-pre-impact anomalies.  The airplane's track was reviewed in reference to satellite images of the area.  The airplane had over flown open fields prior to impact.",

An air traffic controller provided a heading to the closest airport and provided landmarks to help assist the pilot locate the runway.  The 1,440-hour private pilot was not able to find the airport and elected to land in a short field with a prevailing tailwind.  During the landing roll, the airplane collided with several obstacles before the airplane caught on fire.  Examination of the engine revealed that the crankcase was breached above the number 2 cylinder.  The components of the crankshaft and the number 1, number 2, and number 3 connecting rod assemblies exhibited signatures of thermal distress consistent with a lack of lubrication.  The engine driven oil pump was disassembled and examined.  The examination revealed that the two bushings that support the oil driven-gear were not installed, and the driven gear had fractured at the spline-drive.  Further examination found that the oil pump driven-gear support shaft in the oil pump housing exhibited full gear length wear, indicating that it had been operating without bushings.  In addition, the interior wall of the oil pump that housed the driven-gear exhibited heavy scoring and displaced material, indicating binding of the gear.  The oil filter element was removed and the pleats were individually examined.  The pleats contained a minimal amount of metallic debris.  A review of the aircraft maintenance logs revealed that the engine was last overhauled on July 20,1998; however, pertinent details of the repair were not included in the logs and were only referenced in work orders.  The maintenance records revealed that the engine was sent back to the overhauling facility on March 11, 2000, approximately 459.4 hours after the overhaul, due to a reported propeller strike.  The Safety Board contacted the overhauling facility and requested a copy of the work orders for both repairs; however, a company official reported that they only retain records for two years as required by Federal Aviation Regulation 145.219 (c).  Further review of the engine logbook revealed there were no entries that indicated that the oil pump had ever been removed or replaced after the overhaul was completed.  As a result, it could not be determined when/who had last disassembled/re-assembled the pump.  The engine had accrued approximately 1,059.7 hours since it was overhauled at the time of the accident.  At the time of the accident the winds were reported from 210 degrees at 12 knots.",
            "probable_cause": "The loss of engine power as result of the failure by maintenance personnel to install oil pump support bushings, which resulted in the fracture of the driven-gear and subsequent loss of oil pressure.  Contributing factors were the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing and the prevailing tailwind."

The pilot reported that after receiving the dispatch orders he went outside to assess the current weather conditions, which he described as being a \"little hazy.\"  The pilot then obtained the local weather radar depiction and surface weather conditions.  The pilot determined the weather at the departure and destination was suitable for visual flight rules (VFR) operations.  The pilot did not listen to the airport's automated weather observing system (AWOS) broadcast before departure.  The helicopter departed and almost immediately entered instrument meteorological conditions.  He elected to terminate the flight and began a right turn back toward the departure airport.  The pilot stated that he had difficultly maintaining level flight and felt that the helicopter was climbing slightly during the turn.  He thought the attitude indicator was giving a false indication because it was not moving and was \"cocked off center about 30 degrees.\"  The pilot verified that the circuit breaker for the attitude indicator was not tripped.  He saw some ground lighting to the left of the helicopter and started a left turn toward the lights.  The pilot remembered seeing two houses before impact and attempted to steer the helicopter between them.  Global positioning system (GPS) data showed the helicopter departing to the north, and then it made a climbing right turn, followed by a climbing left turn.  The helicopter's maximum recorded altitude during the left turn was about 1,035 feet above ground level (agl).  The helicopter impacted two pine trees, utility lines, a residential structure, a tree, and a garage before coming to a stop.  The helicopter traveled about 325 feet from the initial contact with the two pine trees to its final position.  The local weather conditions were continually broadcast and accessible using a telephone or radio.  About one hour before the accident, the airport's AWOS indicated that the sky was overcast at 400 feet agl and the surface visibility was 3 sm with mist.  About two minutes after the accident, the airport's AWOS indicated that the sky was overcast at 400 feet agl and the ground visibility was 2 1/2 sm.  During the accident flight, the helicopter was operating in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).  The pilot held an instrument rating, but the accident helicopter was not certified for flight in IMC.  According to company documentation, the pilot had logged 26 hours of instrument experience since being hired in 1989.  He had flown 13 hours during the prior 90 days, none of which were in IMC.

The pilot had accumulated 4 hours of total flight time in the accident airplane.  Prior to the accident flight, the pilot secured the side-opening canopy by engaging three interconnected 1/4-inch pins, into three 1/4-inch mating sleeves.  Except for a significant amount of friction between the pins and mating surfaces, there was no locking mechanism for the canopy.  Although the pilot did not experience any difficulties during several prior flights, the canopy opened during the initial climb of the accident flight, about 500 feet agl.  When the canopy opened fully, the airplane became uncontrollable.  Due to airflow over the canopy, the pilot was unable to refasten the pins, and had to hold the canopy closed with his hands.

During the descent for the approach, the crew received a special observation that the weather was ceilings 300 and 1,000 feet broken and 1/2 mile visibility and fog.  The crew briefed the ILS approach for runway 35L.  When approach control (TRACON) cleared the airplane for the ILS approach, the airplane was at 9,000 feet.  The captain reported that as they continued, the glide slope indicator \"came up and actually went below us,\" and that the airplane had not yet intercepted the localizer.  The captain asked TRACON for a lower altitude.  TRACON \"apologized\" and cleared the airplane to 7,000 feet, and then asked the crew if they would still be okay for the approach.  The crew said they would be okay.  The captain said the airplane was configured and was approaching the glide slope from above, as it was intercepting the localizer.  He said the first officer was on the localizer and glide slope.  At 100 feet, the captain called approach lights in sight, and the first officer acknowledged.  When the captain called reaching the decision altitude, the first officer called landing.  The captain said he started to see the threshold lights and then heard the \"glide slope\" GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning System) warning.  The captain called \"pull up\" to the first officer.  The captain said as they touched down he thought he could see some approach light bars below the nose, but did not feel or hear anything unusual.  The landing roll out was normal.  After parking, the crew discovered damage to the left main brake line and loss of hydraulic fluid from the right system.  The airplane showed additional damage to the left main tires, bottom left aft portion of the fuselage, and to the left engine and left engine cowling.  An examination of the runway showed one approach light, 19 feet from the beginning of the paved overrun, broken forward at its base.  Approximately 49 feet from the start of the paved overrun surface, the beginning of two pairs of parallel-running tire marks were observed.  The left pair of tire marks ran through three sets of center approach lights in the overrun, two runway threshold lights, a distance of 354 feet, and continued down runway 35L for approximately 700 feet.  Light stanchions, broken lens pieces, and bulb debris was observed extending down the runway along the tire marks.  An examination of the airplane's avionics equipment and the airport's ILS approach showed no anomalies.  The flight data recorder (FDR) showed that the airplane captured the ILS glide slope 38 seconds prior to touchdown at a radio altitude of 734 feet.   The FDR pitch, recorded 4 seconds later, indicated the airplane was tracking the glide slope and at a radio altitude of 617 feet.  At 5 seconds prior to touchdown, the glide slope showed a 2 dots fly up deviation.  The airplane was at a radio altitude of 114 feet.  The glide slope warning was on.  The glide slope continued to increase reaching 4.3 dots fly up at touchdown.  The airplane's airspeed at touchdown was 133.5 knots.  Vertical acceleration was 1.7 g's followed by 0.7 g's approximately 1/2 second later.  Lateral acceleration was -0.15 g's.  The right outboard spoiler began to deploy at touchdown plus 2.5 seconds.  The hydraulic pressure low lights (left and right) remained in an \"off\" state throughout the incident sequence.  Flight crews are administered a simulator check every 9 months, either by the company or the FAA.  Crews do not fly practice approaches in the airplane.  The first officer's last simulator checkride was 14 months prior to the incident.  The first officer stated he could not recall when the last time was that he flew an instrument approach in the airplane in actual weather conditions.  ",
            "probable_cause": "the first officer's failure to maintain proper glide slope during the landing approach, and the captain's failure to adequately monitor the approach and landing, and his failure to challenge and/or intervene when the first officer continued to descend below the glide slope.  Factors contributing to the incident were the first officer's lack of recent experience in flying a complete ILS approach in actual instrument conditions, the low ceilings and fog."

The pilot stated that after liftoff, while trying to achieve and maintain an appropriate airspeed, the airplane encountered a downdraft, and he then heard a \u201cpop\u201d that he believed to be an engine problem. The airplane struck trees and terrain about 1,500 feet from the departure end of the runway, and incurred substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. Two separate post accident examinations, including a brief engine run, did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal engine operation, and propeller cuts to tree limbs at the accident site indicated that the engine was developing power. According to the pilot, he selected the departure direction based on his observation of a windsock nearest the runway threshold. He had flown into the airport about 10 times previously, and was aware the runway sloped uphill and that there were trees about 1,000 feet beyond the departure end. The lack of an airport wind information recording system precluded determination of the wind conditions at the time of the accident, but calculations based on wind direction and speed information from the three weather observation stations nearest the accident site yielded values that ranged from a 4-knot headwind to an 8-knot tailwind.

Security video and eyewitness reports revealed that the airplane was at low altitude and appeared to be maintaining level flight until it banked right, descended, and impacted water near the airport in a right-wing-down attitude.A postaccident examination of the wreckage indicated that all of the airplane\u2019s flight control cables were lubricated except for a fractured section of aileron control direct cable near the doorpost pulley, which was likely not properly lubricated. Most of the cable strands and the doorpost pulley and bearing exhibited severe corrosion near the fracture. When manipulated by hand, the pulley bearing would not rotate due to the corrosion. Analysis of the cable, doorpost pulley, and an exemplar cable from a similar make and model aircraft that had been flown in similar atmospheric conditions (in what is considered a severe corrosion zone) revealed moderate to severe corrosion. It is likely that, during the airplane\u2019s maintenance inspection 6 months before the accident, the mechanic failed to detect the corroded cable due to the difficulty in visually seeing the cable. It is also likely that the doorpost pulley\u2019s failure to rotate resulted in tension on the right aileron control cable, which subsequently caused it to fail due to the severe corrosion. The aircraft manufacturer\u2019s maintenance manual for the airplane gives specific instructions for lubricating and inspecting flight control cables and pulleys every 600 hours or 12 months, whichever comes first, including, in part, examining the cables for corrosion and the pulleys to ensure smooth rotation. After the accident, the manufacturer produced a video emphasizing the importance of properly examining and lubricating the cables.",

One of several witnesses reported that the airplane circled the area and then began a steep descent towards the intended drop point. The pilot did not release the load of retardant over the drop area. The witness observed the nose of the airplane pitch up and \u201cmush through the flare.\u201d The underside of the airplane then made contact with rising terrain within the saddle and continued uphill on its main landing gear toward a crest where the terrain dropped away. It then descended and collided with terrain in the valley below. Postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies with the airplane, engine, or retardant dispersal system that would have prevented operation. The dispersal system\u2019s operating procedures recommend that it be turned off during flight to prevent inadvertent dumping of the load. According to other pilots it is not uncommon to forget to re-engage the system prior to the drop. The dispersal system included an emergency manual release mechanism that could be used in the event of a primary system failure or an inadvertent oversight by the pilot to turn the system on; however, impact damage prevented an accurate determination of the system's armed status prior to impact. Global Positioning System (GPS) information revealed an excessive rate of descent just prior to the expected drop, which corroborated witness accounts. Analysis of the accident location, with respect to the GPS data, density altitude, airplane load, and witness statements, would indicate that the airplane probably encountered a stall/mush at the drop area. The high density altitude and the airplane's flap settings would have diminished the climb performance considerably in its retardant loaded state. The airplane's continued trajectory after initial impact, as well as propeller witness marks and internal engine damage, indicated that the engine was producing power at the time of the accident.",

The flight had departed LaGuardia International Airport en route to Milwaukee International Airport (MKE).  During climbout through Flight Level 20 (20,000 feet), the No. 1 Hydraulic Low Pressure caution light illuminated.  The flight crew ran the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) checklist for the caution message.  The procedures outlined in the QRH instructed the flight crew to: \"Land at the nearest suitable airport.\"  The captain informed the airline's maintenance control about the caution message, but he did not inform flight dispatch about the caution message or the need to land at the nearest suitable airport.  The flight continued to its destination airport.  The flight was cleared to land on runway 1L.  The winds were 290 degrees at 10 knots.  The captain reported that the landing was normal until the airplane started to veer off the left side of the runway.  The post accident inspection of the airplane revealed no preexisting anomalies, other than the loss of the No. 1 Hydraulic system which resulted in the loss of ground spoilers.  The NTSB Aircraft Performance Study indicated that the airplane approached runway 1L crossing the threshold at about 2302:16 at a recorded radio altitude of about 50 feet above ground level, with an indicated airspeed of 139 knots (about 136 knots ground speed) and a pitch angle of about 4 degrees nose down.  The airplane began to drift right of centerline by about 20 feet, and touchdown occurred at a calculated distance of 2,400 feet beyond the runway threshold in a crab angle of about 5 degrees nose left relative to the ground track, and at a roll angle of about 1 degree left bank angle. The lateral load at touchdown was recorded at -0.2 G's. After touchdown, the airplane's ground track continued to drift right of centerline about 25 feet while the airplane nose remained to the left of the ground track. The airplane's ground track then began to turn left and departed off the side of the runway (veered off the runway) at about 2302:37 and approximately 4,200 feet beyond the threshold. The longitudinal acceleration from point of touchdown to when it veered off the runway was recorded between -0.12 and -0.15 G's.  An investigation of airport operations revealed that airport operations did not inspect Runway 1L/19R after a pilot report (PIREP) of NIL braking action by a Beech Jet at 2018.  Airport operations did not conduct or provide friction measurement reports and (Notices to Airmen) NOTAMS for Runway 1L/19R between March 10 at 1925 and the time of the accident on March 11 at 2302, when airport conditions were changing with significant snowfall accumulations.  The airport did not conduct a runway inspection or friction report of Runway 1L/19R after the airplane veered off the runway.",
            "probable_cause": "the captain's failure to adequately compensate for the crosswind conditions, and his failure to maintain directional control during landing.  Contributing factors include the captain's failure to land at the nearest suitable airport after an in-flight mechanical problem, the airport operation's failure to conduct runway friction tests and to issue NOTAMS in accordance with existing regulations, the crosswind, the snow-covered runway, the runway sign, and night conditions."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The twin engine helicopter experienced a dual loss of engine power while en route to the landing area during external long line logging operations and made a forced landing into trees.  The flight crew noticed the low fuel caution lights began to flicker on and off just prior to the last logging run.  The co-pilot indicated there was 225-250 pounds of fuel left in each fuel tank.  The captain decided that they had enough fuel remaining in each fuel tank to finish the last log run, pickup an empty fuel tank on the long line, and return to their base to refuel with about 200 pounds of fuel in the tanks at landing.  As the flight crew started the last log cycle, the number 1 LOW PRESSURE light illuminated, but the captain determined it was not an emergency situation and they continued with the flight.  After the flight crew picked up the empty fuel tank, it swung toward some ground personnel.  The captain pulled the nose up so that the tank would clear the ground crew.  Shortly thereafter, the number 1 engine lost power.  The captain initiated a landing to a field, but the number 2 engine lost power and the captain performed an autorotational landing to some soft pine trees.  As part of the post accident helicopter recovery efforts, the salvage company drained the fuel tanks and found that approximately 167 pounds of fuel in the forward tank and 154 pounds in the aft tank (in his statement, the captain said that 10 gallons were drained first, set aside as the unusable fuel quantity and not counted in the totals reported by the salvage company).  Post accident examination of the fuel system found that the aft fuel tank ejector pump, which fills the collector can that supplies fuel to the engine, was 90 percent blocked by a material that resembled old fuel tank sealant and/or disintegrating fuel bladder remnants.  The forward fuel tank ejector pump was not obstructed.  The helicopter's flight manual indicates that the low fuel caution lights will illuminate when approximately 210-280 pounds of fuel per tank remain while the helicopter is in a 3-degree nose down attitude, or between 170-200 pounds of fuel per tank remain when in a hover.  A caution note is incorporated in the flight manual indicating that when the fuel low-level caution lights illuminate, attitudes in excess of 6 degrees nose up should be avoided due to the possibility of engine fuel starvation.  The limitations section of the flight manual indicates that the minimum planned fuel on final landing shall not be less than 450 pounds total.  According to the manual, the total unusable fuel is 17.75 pounds of fuel per tank.  The captain said that the versions of the S61 that he had been flying have modified fuel tanks that reduce the minimum landing fuel to 200 pounds and he was unaware that the accident helicopter had the standard military fuel tanks with a higher 450-pound landing minimum.  The captain also said that in the weeks before the accident he had found \"dried up adhesive in the fuel samples\" taken during preflight inspections.  A former crew chief for the company said that the standard procedure the company used in response to fuel leaks was to \"repaint\" the fuel tanks with sealant and return the helicopter to service. ",
            "probable_cause": "the loss of power in all engines due to the pilot's inadequate in-flight decision to continue flight with fuel level below the landing minimums specified in the flight manual, which resulted in the unporting of the fuel supply line and fuel starvation.  A contributing factor was the blocked fuel ejector pump in the aft fuel tank and an inadequate maintenance level on the helicopter's fuel system."

The second airplane in the flight, equipped with wheels, was operated by the student's flight instructor.  During the flight, the weather conditions deteriorated to include light rain, gusty winds, and turbulence.  The flight instructor decided to land on a gravel airstrip adjacent to a small lake because he smelled a gasoline odor in his airplane.  The student pilot began a landing approach to the lake, but his first approach resulted in a go-around.  On the second landing approach, the student pilot said he bounced the landing on the water,and the airplane settled onto the lake, but a wind gust lifted the airplane off the water. He said he then forced the airplane onto the water, but while doing so, he took his eyes off the shore of the lake.  When the airplane finally settled onto the water, he noticed the airplane was close to the shore.  He shut the engine off, but the airplane hit the beach, and came to rest in an area of muskeg, about 40 feet from the shoreline.  The front float attach points were broken during the collision with the shore, and the airplane fuselage pivoted downward. The airplane received damage to the floats, engine cowling and propeller, the fuselage and wings.  The student reported the weather conditions had gusty winds up to 25 knots.",

He said that he applied carburetor heat, but the engine \"froze\" seconds later, and made an off field emergency landing. During the examination of the engine by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector and a Teledyne Lycoming engine representative it was revealed that the No. 3 connecting rod was detached from the crankshaft and was heat damaged. The engine was found to contain rust corrosion. Over time this leads to oil contamination and dirt particle embedment on the bearings. When bearings clearances decrease, this in affect can cause oil starvation. Review of maintenance records revealed that the engine was field overhauled on May 21, 2001. At the time of the overhaul, the engine had a total time of 3,552.6 hours. On April 18, 2008, during the annual inspection, it showed a total time of 1036.8 hours since overhaul.",
