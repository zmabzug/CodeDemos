The wind was estimated by the pilot to be between 12 and 14 knots with gusts up to 20 knots. He elected to land on runway one without flaps and maintained an airspeed between 5 and 10 mph higher than normal due to the gusty conditions. During the flare, he was twice lifted by wind gusts before finally settling on the runway in a nose high attitude just left of centerline. The airplane began to yaw to the left and the pilot attempted to correct with the application of right brake. The airplane continued to the left until the left wing contacted a windsock, damaging the wing and causing the airplane to ground-loop around the windsock. The airplane came to rest after the right wing and elevator contacted the ground.",

A review of air traffic control communications and radar data revealed the pilot was vectored onto the final approach course but never got established on the glide slope.  Instead, he made a controlled descent below the glide slope as he proceeded toward the airport.  When the airplane was five miles from the airport, a tower controller received an aural low altitude alert generated by the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) system.  The tower controller immediately notified the pilot of his low altitude, but the airplane collided with terrain within seconds.  Examination of the instrument approach system and onboard flight navigation equipment revealed no pre-mishap anomalies.  A review of the MSAW adaptation parameters revealed that the tower controller would only have received an aural alarm for aircraft operating within 5 nm of the airport.  However, the frequency change from the approach controller to the tower controller occurred when the airplane was about 10.7 miles from the airport, leaving a 5.7 mile segment where both controllers could receive visual alerts, but only the approach controller received an aural alarm.  A tower controller does not utilize a radar display as a primary resource for managing air traffic.  In 2004, the FAA changed a policy, which eliminated an approach controller's responsibility to inform a tower controller of a low altitude alert if the tower had MSAW capability.  The approach controller thought the MSAW alarm parameter was set 10 miles from the airport, and not the 5 miles that existed at the time of the accident.  Subsequent investigation revealed, that The FAA had improperly informed controllers to ensure they understood the alarm parameters for control towers in their area of responsibility.  This led the approach controller to conclude that the airplane was no longer her responsibility once she handed it over to the tower controller.  Plus, the tone of the approach controller's aural MSAW alarm was not sufficient in properly alerting her of the low altitude alert.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to fly a stabilized instrument approach at night which resulted in controlled flight into terrain.  Contributing factors were; the dark night, low clouds, the inadequate design and function of the airport facility\u2019s Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System (MSAW), and the FAA\u2019s inadequate procedure for updating information to ATC controllers."

The flight was the final leg of a four-leg trip, which the pilot had begun approximately 1120 that morning.  At 2220, the flight began a slow descent toward the destination airport.  Radar data confirmed that the airplane executed a steady descent, and flew a straight line course toward Graham.  The final radar return occurred 37 minutes later at an altitude of 3,000 feet (radar coverage is not available below 3,000 feet), 8 miles southeast of the Graham Municipal Airport.  Two minutes after the final radar return, the pilot reported to air traffic control that the flight was two miles out, and he canceled VFR flight following.  No further communications or distress calls were received from the airplane.  The pilot did not request or receive updated weather from the air traffic controllers during the flight.  According to witnesses who lived near the accident site, they heard an airplane flying low, observed dense fog and heard the sounds of an airplane crashing.  According to the nearest weather reporting station, near the time of the accident, the temperature- dew point spread was within 2 degrees, visibilities were reduced to between 3 and 4 miles in fog, and the ceiling was decreasing from 600 feet broken to 400 feet overcast.

An FAA airworthiness directive mandated that a thorough preflight inspection of the #2 engine inlet and bellmouth area be conducted in icing conditions.  The maintenance personnel that performed the de-ice procedure and the preflight inspection, said that a puddle of de-ice fluid was visible in the #2 engine bellmouth area.  Post-accident examination of the #2 engine revealed \"soft body\" damage, consistent with the ingestion of ice, and \"hard body\" damage, consistent with the ingestion of ice-damaged engine parts.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the heated bellmouth drain-line modification that was noted in the logbook, had not been completed.",

The new owner told the pilot that someone had taken one of the cowl plugs. The new owner then removed the remaining one. The airplane sat unattended for 7 months without any cowl plugs before the new owner moved and wanted the airplane relocated to an airport near his home. The pilot volunteered to fly it there.Two days before the flight, the pilot began to prepare the airplane. He stated that he conducted a thorough check of the cowling, engine, and engine mount area due to the amount of time that it sat without cowl plugs. He removed two bird nests, straw, and other debris. He checked the engine mount area through an access panel. After cleaning, there appeared to be no debris in the engine compartment. On the day before the flight, he fueled the airplane with 50 gallons of fresh fuel and ran the engine for 30 minutes. He taxied around to verify flight control continuity and checked the brakes. He stated that everything was normal. On the day of the accident, the pilot preflighted the airplane and visually confirmed that the wing tanks were full of fuel. He selected the left tank before taxi, and prior to departure conducted an engine run-up, checking the engine for about 15 minutes. He checked the magnetos and carburetor heat during the run-up, and both were normal. He then extended the wing flaps to 15 degrees and proceeded to take off. He reported that everything was normal until the airplane was over the end of the runway, about 250 feet above the ground, when the engine suddenly lost power. The pilot switched tanks and turned on the boost pump in an unsuccessful attempt to get the engine to run. He maneuvered to find a place to land, but was over a residential area and crashed into a tree and houses before coming to rest.Examination of the wreckage revealed preexisting damage to the left wing and fuselage, as well as other anomalies that would have rendered the airplane unairworthy before the accident. The engine compartment contained the remains of bird nests and bird excrement, which would have affected the air-cooled engine's ability to maintain a normal operating temperature. The cloth jacketing from a foam-filled cowl plug along with the foam insert were protruding from and blocking the engine combustion air inlet opening. This would have cut off the engine's ability to intake air. Examination of the carburetor also revealed the presence of a golf ball-size mud dauber wasp nest in the carburetor throat below the main fuel nozzle, which would have also restricted air flow and atomization of fuel in the carburetor. Therefore, the condition of the airplane casts doubt on the thoroughness of the pilot's preparations and preflight inspection.Review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and maintenance records revealed that the pilot's most recent application for a medical certificate was in 2006, and that the airplane's last annual inspection was in 1998. The investigation also discovered that the airplane had been operated for about 278 hours in the 15 years since that inspection was performed. Further, the pilot had not applied for a special flight permit from the FAA for the flight, even though the airplane was overdue for its annual inspection. The pilot's decision to fly the airplane without a valid medical certificate, current annual inspection, or ferry permit indicates that he made a conscious decision to disregard basic safety practices.

During the maneuver, the engine lost power, and the pilot performed a forced landing to a parking lot. Postaccident examination revealed the fuel selector switch was in the off position; however, the pilot said that, after the accident, he turned the fuel selector from an unknown position to OFF and that he could not recall the prior position. The examination also found that the right wing fuel tank contained about 14 gallons of fuel, and the left tank was empty. Although the left wing tank was ruptured during impact, no evidence of fuel leakage or odor was found at the site. The airplane was equipped with a non-standard engine and propeller and did not have a Supplemental Type Certificate for the installation. Further, the pilot did not have fuel consumption information for the current engine-propeller installation; thus, the pilot likely misjudged the fuel consumption for the flight. It is likely that the fuel selector was positioned to the left tank, which had become very low on fuel. The slip maneuver aggravated the low fuel condition of the left wing fuel tank, and the airplane was starved of fuel, which resulted in the loss of engine power. Additionally, the pilot's failure to utilize the auxiliary fuel pump per the pilot operating handbook during air start most likely prevented the engine from restarting. Postaccident examination revealed no anomalies that would have precluded the normal operation of the airplane or engine components.",

The wreckage was found shortly after noon the same day and there were no witnesses to the accident.  Although the aircraft was extensively damaged by fire, 10-11 foot ground scars indicated a westerly track along the +5 degree up sloped terrain immediately followed by propeller slash marks 14 inches apart placing the aircraft's nose (longitudinal axis) along a west-southwest heading.  The distance between the propeller slash marks and the final resting place of the aircraft's engine was 27.5 feet with the aircraft coming to rest with its longitudinal axis along an approximate north/south line (tail north).  The leading edge of the left wing displayed aftward compressive damage characteristic of ground impact and the propeller spinner likewise showed aftward compressive damage.  The right wing displayed no such damage.  Propeller tip fragments were found embedded near the propeller ground slash marks and adjacent to the aircraft's tail.  No control discontinuity nor mechanical malfunction was evident during the wreckage examination.

They then flew it to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after making a stop in Marianna, Florida, for fuel. Upon arriving in Fort Lauderdale, the pilots gave their fuel request to the customer service agent at the fixed base operator (FBO), advising them that they would be departing the following morning. On the morning of the accident, the pilot filed a flight plan while the pilot-rated passenger conducted the airplane preflight. He did not remove the fuel caps and look in both wing tank fuel filler openings. After filing the flight plan, the pilot walked around the airplane without performing a preflight or looking in the wing tank fuel filler openings. After takeoff, the pilots climbed the airplane to a cruising altitude of 27,000 feet. The flight was uneventful until the pilots observed that the fuel quantity indicators were reading lower than anticipated. Sometime later, both engine lost power; the pilots reported that they were having engine problems and declared an emergency. They then ditched the airplane in the Caribbean Sea, were uninjured, and were later rescued. The pilot stated that, based on the fueling ticket, he concluded that the airplane had been refueled with 134 gallons of fuel before departure, which would have been sufficient for the airplane to reach their destination. Once in flight, he realized that the fuel quantity indicators were reading lower than anticipated; he looked at the fuel ticket again to confirm that 134 gallons of fuel had been delivered. However, review of the fueling process revealed that after arrival in Fort Lauderdale, the pilot had requested that the FBO personnel top off the nacelle tanks. This was accomplished, but only 25 gallons of fuel was needed to comply with the request, and this amount was accurately listed on the fuel ticket. Further review revealed that the number 134, which the pilot thought was the amount of fuel uploaded, was in actuality the employee number of the fueler.Review of the airplane's Pilot's Operating Handbook and Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM) revealed that this fuel discrepancy should have been caught even before the flight departed, as the POH/AFM checklists for operating the airplane required the pilots to confirm the fuel quantity during preflight, before engine starting, and before takeoff. The fuel discrepancy could also have been detected once airborne if the fuel quantity switch on the fuel control panel had been in the \"TOTAL\" position during flight, which would have given an indication of the total amount of fuel onboard. However, the pilot advised that the fuel quantity switch was in the \"NACELLE\" position during the flight and about every 20 minutes he would check the \"wing\" (total) quantity. This procedure did not conform with the guidance contained in the POH/AFM which advised that the \"NACELLE\" position was to be used to verify nacelle fuel quantity during operations with the \"NO FUEL XFR\" annunciator illuminated.Additionally, the accident could have been avoided 2 hours into the flight, while over the island of Hispaniola, when the pilot noticed that he had an approximate 40-knot tailwind but the amount of fuel onboard was less than usual after 2 hours of flying. However, the pilot decided to continue despite his proximity to airports on Hispaniola that were suitable for diversion. By the time he began to be concerned about a possible fuel leak or indication failure, he was once again over open water. As the situation worsened, the pilot finally decided to divert to Aruba, but by then it was too late, and he was forced to ditch the airplane.",
            "probable_cause": "A complete loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion as a result of the pilot's failure to verify that sufficient fuel was onboard prior to flight. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's misreading of the fuel ticket and his improper operation of the fuel control panel , and his delay in recognizing the fuel shortage."

Radar contact ceased at 11,300 feet due to radar signal reception difficulties.  Contact was lost almost directly over the eventual impact site, which was on the eastern side of a small valley.  Witnesses on the western side of the valley had seen the airplane flying near them, at treetop level, eastbound, and clear of clouds.

The pilot attempted to land on the runway, but the airplane touched down in the overrun area, bounced, and landed hard. The airplane was examined a couple of days after the accident, and no fuel was found in the airplane; however, damage to the airplane likely resulted in fuel seeping from the tanks and into the ground before the examination.

The airplane had previously received substantial damage to the nose wheel assembly on a previous flight to the airstrip. Repairs were made to the airframe, and the pilot was departing for a maintenance facility. The pilot had flown in and out of the airstrip on numerous occasions, but not in the accident type airplane. The lodge owner reported that the pilot started both engines and taxied the length of the airstrip, stopping momentarily several times. The pilot ran the engines for about 20 minutes, and then began a takeoff to the south. The airplane appeared to accelerate and remain on the centerline of the airstrip, but did not liftoff until the very end of the airstrip. The owner did not notice any unusual sounds or appearance of the engines. After liftoff, the wheels of the airplane struck and broke off the tops of trees and shrubs, that were about 6 to 7 feet above the ground. The airplane immediately veered to the right, and went out of the lodge owner's sight, but he continued to hear the airplane hitting trees until final impact. The airplane crashed in a shallow lake, coming to rest about 300 feet from shore, in about 5 feet of water. The entire cockpit area, forward of the wings, was torn off the airframe. The validity of any postaccident cockpit and instrument findings was unreliable due to the extensive damage to the cockpit. Likewise, structural damage to the airframe precluded determining wing flap settings during takeoff. Performance calculations indicated that the airplane's takeoff distance would have been about 950 feet, although the lodge owner said that in his experience, the accident airplane was capable of lifting off about half way down the airstrip without difficulty. The circumstances of the takeoff indicated that the left engine had been producing sufficient power to chop through several trees during the crash. Testing and inspection of the right engine was inconclusive, and although it was run on a test stand at reduced power, full power could not be attained due to ingestion of foreign material during the test run.",

The commercial pilot and a physician on board were lost and presumed fatally injured. The copilot and a flight nurse were fatally injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the positioning flight from FLL to Cozumel, Mexico.The airplane had just completed an air ambulance flight for Air Evac International from San Jose, Costa Rica to FLL, and was repositioning back to its base in Cozumel, Mexico.Preliminary voice and radar information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed the airplane had departed Runway 10 at approximately 1950, climbed straight ahead to an altitude of 2,200 feet, at an approximate groundspeed of 200 knots, when the pilot requested radar vectors back to runway 10L at FLL due to an \"engine failure.\" The controller directed the pilot to maintain 4,000 feet and turn to a heading of 340 degrees. The pilot replied, \"Not possible\" and requested a 180-degree turn back to the airport.At 19:52:34, the pilot declared a \"mayday\" and requested vectors back to FLL. Over the approximately three minutes that followed, the pilot requested vectors to the airport multiple times. While the pilot requested, received, and acknowledged additional radar vectors to the southwest from ATC to return to the airport, the airplane continued its slow turn and descent to the north. During the approximately two minutes that transpired after the pilot declared his intention to return to FLL, the airplane descended to 900 feet and slowed to140 knots as it flew northbound, parallel to the shoreline and away from FLL.At 19:53:42, about 700 feet and 150 knots, the airplane initiated a left turn towards shore. The airplane continued its descending left turn until radar contact was lost at 100 feet and 150 knots on a southwesterly heading, at 19:55:42.The pilot was issued a commercial pilot certificate by the government of Mexico, with ratings for airplane single- and multi-engine land, and instrument airplane. His most recent medical certificate was issued August 22, 2013. According to the operator, the pilot had accrued 10, 091 total hours of flight experience, of which 1,400 hours were in the 30-series Learjet.The copilot was issued a commercial pilot certificate by the government of Mexico, with ratings for airplane single-engine, airplane multiengine land and instrument airplane. His most recent medical certificate was issued on June 26, 2013. According to the operator, the copilot had accrued 1,235 total hours of flight experience, of which 175 hours were in the accident airplane make and model.According to FAA and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 1979. Its most recent continuous airworthiness inspection was completed November 4, 2013, at 6,842 aircraft hours.At 1953, the weather reported at Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (FLL), located 6 miles southwest of the accident site included few clouds at 2,500 feet and a scattered layer at 6,500 feet. The wind was calm and visibility was 9 miles.

They reported that the crew's CG calculations were reviewed by support, flight management, and dispatch staff prior to the flight.   They also noted that while the crew was trained in two-engine ferry operations, their training did not include information regarding the CG shift with the CLG retracted.  The operator said that while the appropriate weight and balance information was provided in an appendix to the approved Boeing Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM), the Boeing MD-11 Two-Engine Ferry Operations Manual the crew was using did not reference any change in the CG with the CLG retracted.

A review of the weight and balance data provided by the operator disclosed that the airplane was slightly aft of the zero fuel weight (ZFW) allowable center of gravity limit even when the calculations were computed using the more liberal CLG extended CG limits.  When they were computed using the correct, CLG retracted data, the airplane's ZFW CG was approximately 3.2 per cent of mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) aft of the allowable limit.  Discussions with Boeing staff disclosed that the MD-11 Two-Engine Ferry Manual was taken from the DC-10's.  The DC-10 is a predecessor to the MD-11, and is similar in appearance and configuration, although the DC-10's fuselage is several feet shorter.  The DC-10, however, does not have a forward shift in the aft CG limit when the CLG is retracted.  Boeing personnel noted that although the MD-11's ferry manual recommends that the CLG be retracted for a two-engine ferry, they state that it is not essential.  Boeing has issued a Flight Operations Bulletin (FOB), dated November 14, 2005,  to MD-11 and DC-10 operators indicating that all DC-10 and MD-11 Two-Engine Ferry Manuals are out of date, and they cannot vouch for their accuracy.  The FOB also has information on how the operators may obtain additional, current two-engine ferry performance/procedures information.",
            "probable_cause": "The operator's failure to provide sufficient weight and balance information to the flight crew, which resulted in a center of gravity aft of the limit, and a tail strike during the takeoff roll.  Factors associated with the incident are the operator's improper training of the flight crew on two-engine ferry procedures, the flight crew's incorrect calculation of the center of gravity, the company dispatcher's failure to comply with the proper weight and balance procedures, and the airplane manufacturer's unclear/conflicting information contained in their Two-Engine Ferry Manual."

The flight instructor and the sport pilot (under instruction for her private pilot certificate) were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and the airplane, which had just departed South Albany Airport (4B0), Selkirk, New York, was not operating on a flight plan. The instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to a witness, the pilots told him that that they were going to fly to Columbia County Airport (1B1), Hudson, New York, and that the sport pilot was going to practice maneuvers for her upcoming practical test. The witness then saw the pilots get into the airplane, and while he was walking to his hangar, heard a \"normal\" engine run-up. He subsequently heard the airplane take off [from runway 19], and it \"seemed normal.\" Shortly thereafter, the witness heard the engine \"shut off [and] a second later it started back up.\" After another second, the witness heard a loud crash.A second witness, who was outside the airport office, saw the airplane take off from runway 19, and after it reached an altitude of about 100 feet, the engine quit. A few seconds later, the witness thought he heard the engine restart, then he heard a loud bang.A third witness was standing by his parked airplane about \u00be of the way down the runway. According to the witness, the accident airplane took off \"normally\" just past where the witness was standing, and when it had climbed to about 100 feet, the engine completely lost power. The airplane leveled, the engine started again, and the airplane continued a climb past the end of the runway. The engine then began to run \"rough,\" and the airplane banked to the right. As it continued banking, the engine \"lost most of its power,\" and the airplane descended while still in a bank. The airplane then disappeared below a tree line, and the witness heard a single, loud bang.The airplane came to rest in a train yard, next to a line of double deck, covered rail car automobile carriers (auto racks), in the vicinity of 42 degrees, 33.3 minutes north latitude, 073 degrees, 50.1 minutes west longitude. One of the rail cars had white paint transfer marks on its roof and side, which matched damage found on the underside of the left wing and the left wing strut. The side of the rail car also had an area that was indented, with a portion of the left side of the airplane's engine shroud embedded in it.The airplane had significant fore-to-aft crush damage of the engine compartment. All of the airplane's flight control surfaces were located at the accident site, and flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit to all of those surfaces. The propeller blades had some leading edge damage and chordwise gouges. The fuel selector was found in the \"Both\" position; however, one of the first responders stated that he had moved it, but couldn't recall in which direction, in an attempt to stop fuel from leaking. Both wing fuel tanks contained fuel, that when drained, was blue in color and absent of water or debris. The gascolator was destroyed. The single fuel vent initially seemed blocked; however, once removed and sectioned, no blockage was found. Rubber vent coverings on both vented fuel caps were pliable and in good condition.The engine did not exhibit any mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Crankshaft continuity, compression and spark were all confirmed.There were no recording devices onboard the airplane. In addition, the witness standing by the airport office did not hear any radio transmissions from the airplane, and the radio in the office did not have a recording capability.

Prior to takeoff, the pilot informed the air traffic controller (ATC) that he had received the airport's weather.  A broken sky condition existed with layers about 5,500 and 7,000 feet mean sea level (msl).

The flight continued and the airplane tracked near the centerline of Victor Airway 183, which had a published course of 195 degrees.  The pilot was familiar with the roundtrip route between his Santa Barbara home-base airport and Bakersfield, and he had previously flown over the route.  During the last few minutes of the radar-recorded flight, the pilot was generally cruising about 6,500 feet, as indicated by the mode C altitude reporting transponder.

On July 11, 2014, a Boeing B-767-332, registration number N139DL, operated by Delta Air Lines (DAL), and powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80A2 turbofan engines, experienced a left engine (No. 1) fire during climb from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Los Angles, California.  The flightcrew reported observing a left engine fire indication during climb and declared an emergency, performed the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) engine fire procedures which included shutting down the affected engine, and an air turnback to LAX was initiated.  The airplane made a successful and uneventful overweight single-engine landing at LAX and Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) personnel met the aircraft and observed no damage.  The airplane taxied to the gate without incident.  Delta maintenance personnel opened the left engine cowling and observed heat damage, scorching, and sooting.          An examination of the engine revealed that the fire damage was concentrated underneath the engine heatshield on the left side of the engine.  Flow testing of the engine revealed a fuel leak from the integrated drive generator (IDG) fuel/oil heat exchanger main housing.  This was determined to be the source of the flammable fluid leak.  Metallurgical examination of the IDG fuel/oil heat exchanger found a through-wall fatigue crack but no anomalies were found at the crack initiation site.  The portions of the IDG power feeder cables located underneath the engine heat shield and in the general vicinity of the IDG fuel/oil heat exchanger revealed evidence of chaffing and arc burns and exhibited a considerable amount of orange tape to bundle all the cables together.  The accessory drive lube and scavenge pump pressure (supply) line support bracket exhibited evidence of melted material consistent with an arc burn.  The locations of the arc burn on the support bracket and the power feeder cables were in-line with one another and were the source of the electrical spark that ignited the fuel.  Review of the IDG power feeder cable installation below the engine heatshield on the event engine revealed that they were misrouted creating excessive slack and dangling below the support bracket.  This excessive slack in the IDG power feeder cables created the situation where the cables could get pinched/wedged between the inside of the thrust reverse cowl and the accessory drive lube and scavenge pump pressure (supply) line support bracket when the thrust cowl is closed and latched, creating the environment for the IDG power feeder cables to chaff against the support bracket.  The excessive amount of tape used on the IDG power feeder cables suggests that maintenance personnel may have noticed this chaffing and added extra tape without realizing that the chaffing was caused from the thrust reverser pressing the IDG power feeder cables against the bracket or that the slack was contributing to the chaffing.  DAL inspected their entire fleet of CF6-80A2 powered Boeing 767 and corrected any IDG power feeder cables that had been misrouted.",

THE INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT OBTAINED A WEATHER BRIEFING AND WAS TOLD VFR FLIGHT WAS NOT RECOMMENDED DUE TO A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS BETWEEN HIS DEPARTURE POINT AND DESTINATION, AND A CONVECTIVE SIGMET HAD BEEN ISSUED. ADDITIONALLY, FLIGHT PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN POSTED FOR MOUNTAIN OBSCUREMENT, LIGHT TO MODERATE MIXED TO CLEAR ICING, AND OCCASIONAL LIGHT TO MODERATE TURBULENCE.  THE PILOT DID NOT FILE A FLIGHT PLAN AND DEPARTED.  HUNTERS REPORTED SEEING A LOW FLYING TWIN ENGINE AIRPLANE CIRCLE THE AREA, THEN THEY HEARD THE IMPACT.  THEY SAID THE WEATHER CONSISTED OF A LOW CEILING, REDUCED VISIBILITY, FOG, HIGH WINDS, AND RAIN THAT FOLLOWED A SNOW SHOWER.  RECORDS INDICATE THE PILOT DID NOT FLY BETWEEN 1978 AND 1991, AND HAD RECENTLY BEEN GIVEN A CHECKOUT IN THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE.  NEAR VERTICAL IMPACT RESULTED IN MINIMAL WRECKAGE SCATTER. ",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot reported that on a previous flight, he encountered an uncommanded roll, so he checked the three main rotor Lamiflex bearings prior to departure. He said one bearing showed no indication of a pending failure, the second showed some indication of approaching failure, and the third showed a minor indication that it was beginning to fail. From past experience, the pilot said that he believed that he still had several hours before the bearings would fail and that he could safely proceed with the flight. A few miles from the intended destination, a vibration started and became progressively worse to the point where the pilot was losing control of the helicopter. The pilot subsequently made what he described as a \u201ccontrolled crash landing,\u201d which resulted in substantial damage to the helicopter. A postaccident examination revealed that the No. 2 main rotor Lamiflex bearing failed, which resulted in the loss of control. A review of maintenance logbooks found that the helicopter was not in compliance with either its annual inspection requirement or with FAA Airworthiness Directive 94-17-15, which required repetitive inspections of the helicopter\u2019s main rotor Lamiflex bearings.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inability to maintain helicopter control during cruise flight due to the failure of the No. 2 main rotor Lamiflex bearing. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to operate the helicopter with a known deficiency and the helicopter\u2019s noncompliance with the mandatory scheduled inspection of the main rotor bearings."
