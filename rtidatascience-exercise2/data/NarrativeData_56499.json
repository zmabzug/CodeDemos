While descending, the copilot's Primary Flight Display (PFD) began to flicker. About 5 minutes later, as the airplane transitioned through 28,000 feet mean sea level, the left PFD flashed a \"PFT\" alert indicating that the autopilot had disconnected. The pilot said he immediately felt heavy control forces on the control yoke that he had to exert to fly the airplane. Shortly thereafter, the pilot discovered that the electric pitch trim was not operational. While hand-flying the airplane the pilot entered instrument meteorological conditions as the airplane descended through a 2,400-foot-thick cloud layer. Thereafter, the pilot continued a visual approach to the 4,897-foot-long runway. The pilot noted that he was overwhelmed with the electrical failures and fatigued from maneuvering the airplane by hand for such a long duration (which he approximated was around 45 minutes). The airplane crossed the runway threshold about 15 knots faster than the correct landing speed and the airplane touched down past the midpoint of the runway. The pilot realized that despite his braking attempts the airplane was going to continue off the runway surface over a small downsloping cliff at the end. He determined that he would not be able to abort the landing due to the airplane's diminished ground speed and elected to perform a 180-degree turn. The airplane ground looped, coming to rest in a dirt area south of the runway; the main landing gear collapsed and the flaps folded under the wings. According to the pilot, he never attempted to reset the autopilot system. The autopilot was designed for an automatic disengagement when there is a system failure, invalid sensor data, or yaw damper failure. On the manufacturer's current Pilots' Abbreviated Checklist, Emergency Procedures section, it states that if the autopilot preflight test fail warning (red \"PFT\" warning on the PFD) illuminates, the pilot should reset the associated circuit breaker to clear the fault. A post-accident examination of the airplane's systems revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures, with the exception of a flickering PFD screen.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's misjudgment of speed and distance, resulting in an overshoot of the runway. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to follow the Autopilot Preflight Test Fail checklist and his distraction with a flickering primary flight display screen. "

While maneuvering at an altitude of approximately 12,500 feet mean sea level (msl), the pilot noticed a group of individuals exited a portion of the tree-covered area, and a National Guard UH-60 helicopter was staged on the ground in an open area.  After a radio conversation with the National Guard pilot, the news helicopter pilot attempted to land in the open area, in order to obtain video footage of the rescue.  After circling the open area 3 times at an airspeed of 40 to 50 knots, the pilot attempted to land approximately 300 feet from the National Guard helicopter.  Approximately 30 feet above ground level (agl), the pilot applied forward cyclic to increase airspeed for a run-on landing.  Shortly thereafter, the helicopter began a yaw to the right.  The pilot then applied full left anti-torque pedal input; however, the yaw to the right continued.  Approximately 10 feet agl, the pilot reduced throttle and applied forward cyclic.  Subsequently, the helicopter impacted terrain nose first, rolled to the left and came to rest on its left side.  The accident site was located in mountainous open terrain at an elevation of approximately 12,400 msl.  The pilot reported the wind was calm and the temperature was approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  The pilot stated he did not complete any performance calculations prior to the flight.  No preaccident anomalies were noted with the helicopter.  The FAA have published information about the loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE).  At higher altitudes, where the air is thinner, tail rotor thrust and efficiency is reduced.  When operating at high altitudes and high gross weight, especially while hovering, the tail rotor thrust may not be sufficient to maintain directional control and LTE can occur.  In this case, the hovering ceiling is limited by tail rotor thrust and not necessarily power available.  In these conditions gross weights need to be reduced and/or operations need to be limited to lower density altitudes.  ",

The pilot told an acquaintance at the airport that he intended only a short flight.  The acquaintance noted that the pilot did not have oxygen and offered to loan the pilot some; however, the pilot reiterated that he only intended on doing a short local flight.  The glider was not equipped with gyroscopic flight attitude reference instruments.  Witnesses reported hearing an engine rev up and down prior to hearing a loud bang.  Several of the witnesses observed the aircraft falling from the base of the clouds with separated wings and debris following behind.  Review of the weather in the area of the accident revealed there were unstable wave conditions that were reported as rapidly changing by another glider pilot.  The pilot witness said the wave conditions were not very strong, nor was the mountain wave very well established.  The air gap between the mountain cap cloud and the downwind lenticular clouds was rapidly closing and opening, creating an area that one moment was free of clouds and the next moment completely obscured.  There were also reports of moderate turbulence in the accident area and freezing levels were reported above 9,200 feet in clouds and precipitation.  The cloud tops were reported to be between 15,000 and 16,000 feet, while the bases were between 8,000 and 9,000 feet.  Review of the glider's radar data revealed it was flying along a southerly heading at 14,600 feet mean sea level (msl).  The glider's radar track then depicted the glider making a turn toward the northeast and enter two spiraling right turns with a rapid descent.  The glider descended from 14,600 feet to 9,200 feet in 1 minute, which was the last radar return received.  Post-accident examination of the composite wings revealed the right wing spar failed in two locations while the left spar failed in four locations.  All of the fractures were consistent with an overload failure and were not associated with any obvious manufacturing defects.  No preimpact anomalies were noted with the flight controls.  The never exceed and maneuvering speeds of the glider were 135 and 100 knots, respectively.  The limit load factor was established at +5.3/-2.65.  The pilot did not wear a parachute due to previous back injuries and pain.  He had not had a current medical certificate for more than 7 years prior to the accident, and review of his medical history revealed he had a number of medical conditions that could have resulted in an incapacitation event; however, the autopsy results were inconclusive in determining the likelihood of this possibility.  He was also taking some potentially impairing medications such as brompheniramine and diazepam; however, no blood samples were available, and it was not possible to determine precisely when the drugs might have been used nor the level of potential impairment at the time of the accident.",

The pilot reported that during cruise flight the rotor and engine noise suddenly decreased and the helicopter began a descent.  During the ensuing forced landing, the helicopter landed hard.  The helicopter was fabricated from an ex-military remanufactured and modified Sikorsky S-55 (UH-19D).  The original radial reciprocating engine had been replaced with a Garrett Gas Turbine TPE 331 modified to a TSE 331 IOUA 511SW.  It had a 6,000-hour time between overhaul.  According to maintenance records dating back to July 3, 1985, the accident engine P-54083 operated in more than one Fairchild SA226 airplane in Australia, and several rotary wing S-55 aircraft during their certification in the United States.  Following the accident the engine was shipped to the modifier for functional testing in a cell.  The engine started and idled normally.  Increasing the rpm to the certified operating specification of 101.5 percent revealed no abnormal conditions.  The test propeller was moved from the start locks and increasing torque load was applied.  As the torque was increased the engine responded normally until approximately 60 percent torque when the indicated engine rpm rapidly decreased and an emergency shutdown was initiated.  The process was repeated through 12 cycles, during which the indicated rpm began a sudden rapid decrease when torque was increased.  Test cell troubleshooting failed to identify or correct this condition.  During manual rotation of the propeller following the final cycle some \"slipping\" was noted between the output shaft and the main rotating group.  Subsequent examination of the gearbox revealed disengagement of the sun and bull gear assembly.  Examination revealed fretting damage to the retaining nut and mating surfaces related to loss of specified torque.  Visual examination of the sun and bull gears revealed severe damage to the mating splines of both gears.  About 9 months before the accident the original manufacturer issued a service bulletin providing for the replacement of the affected components; the engine modifier recommended replacement of the components prior to further operation.  Examination of past oil analysis samplings revealed increases of iron and magnesium over a period of time, with analysis report comments of \"Alert\" and \"Iron Appears High.\"",

The pilot reported that the manual indicated that for this power setting, the aircraft was capable of five hours and 15 minutes with a 45 minute reserve.  While en route, the headwind was higher than the pilot expected.  The pilot opted to divert to the southwest in an attempt to increase the airspeed.  An altitude increase by several thousand feet was necessary for terrain clearance.  The airspeed did not increase and the pilot opted to divert to another airport for landing as the flight now approached four hours with an estimated 45 minutes to an hour to go.  While en route to the alternate airport, the engine rpm started to decrease at about four hours and 25 minutes into the flight.  The pilot reported the emergency to air traffic control and set-up for an off-airport landing.  When the pilot broke out of the cloud layer, he noted that he would not make the airport and performed a landing to a creek.  During the descent, the aircraft collided with trees before coming to rest in the creek bed.  During the wreckage recovery, the wing fuel tanks were intact.

The rooftop pad had not been cleared of snow, and the flight was the first to arrive since the ground-level pad was cleared of snow the previous day. According to the pilot of the medical transport flight, while on final approach to the ground-level helipad, he observed that it was clear of snow, but that snow banks 2 to 5 feet high bounded the pad. The pilot intended to land facing a wall that was about 20 feet from the edge of the pad, while leaving sufficient room to allow the medical receiving personnel to safely maneuver themselves, their equipment, and their patients between the front of the helicopter and the snow bank. After the patients were unloaded and the helicopter was secured, the pilot and flight paramedic went into the hospital for about 12 minutes. On their return to the helicopter, the crew observed that the fenestron was in contact with the top of a snow bank. They examined the fenestron and tail rotor, determined that the helicopter was undamaged, and proceeded with boarding and departure activities. During the attempted liftoff, the pilot noticed a vibration from the rear of the aircraft. He lowered the collective, turned off the engine, and exited the helicopter to determine the cause of the vibration. The helicopter sustained damage to the fenestron, tail rotor blades, and tail rotor drive components due to contact with the snow bank. The hospital used its security and facilities personnel to clear snow from the helipads, but it did not possess or provide them with any formal guidance regarding snow-clearing procedures. Site documentation indicated that the helipad pavement was unmarked, with the exception of a 3-foot wide perimeter stripe. Although compliance was not mandatory, the snow removal was not accomplished in accordance with readily-available Federal Aviation Administration guidance. Snow bank heights and distances from the pad did not provide adequate clearances for operations; the pad pavement was not fully cleared, and the pad perimeter stripe behind the helicopter was completely obscured by a snow bank. The hospital did not issue a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) regarding the presence of snow banks. The crew's pre-departure examination of the fenestron and tail rotor was superficial and unlikely to detect possible damage. No circumstances that precluded the crew from requesting the removal of additional snow, or rolling the helicopter forward so that the fenestron was clear of the snow bank prior to the attempted departure, were discovered. Examination of security video was inconclusive as to whether the damage was incurred during the arrival, the attempted departure, or both.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various sources and may not have traveled in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft incident report.During the takeoff roll as the captain was about to call \"eighty\" knots, the first officer called \"hundred.\"  The captain noted that the standby airspeed indicator agreed with the first officer's and decided to continue the takeoff and address the anomaly of his airspeed indicator after takeoff.  The pilots indicated that EICAS messages appeared and disappeared several times after takeoff and during the climb, including the messages MACH/SPD TRIM and RUDDER RATIO.   Checklists for MACH/SPD TRIM and RUDDER RATIO messages did not mention an unreliable airspeed as a possible condition. The modifications associated with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 757-34A0222 (and mandated by FAA Airworthiness Directive 2004-10-15 after the incident), which had not been incorporated on the incident airplane, would have provided a more direct indication of the airspeed anomaly.  According to information in the Icelandair Operations Manual, these EICAS messages (in conjunction with disagreements between the captain and first officer airspeed indicators) may indicate an unreliable airspeed.  Overspeed indications and simultaneous overspeed and stall warnings (both of which occurred during the airplane's climb from FL330 to FL370) are also cited as further indications of a possible unreliable airspeed.  The crew did take actions in an attempt to isolate the anomalies (such as switching from the center autopilot to the right autopilot at one point during the flight).  However, this did not affect the flight management computer's use of data from the left (captain's) air data system, and the erroneous high airspeeds subsequently contributed to airplane-nose-up autopilot commands during and after the airplane's climb to FL370.  During the climb the captain's indicated airspeed began to increase, and the overspeed warning occurred. The first officer indicated that at this time his airspeed indication and the standby airspeed indication both decreased to about 220 knots and his pitch attitude felt high.  Despite agreement between the first officer and standby airspeed indications and the pilots' belief that the captain's airspeed indicator was inaccurate, control was transferred from the first officer to the captain.  Pitch attitude continued to climb and airspeed continued to decay after the captain assumed control.  The airplane's pitch attitude became excessively high until the airplane's stick shaker activated and the airplane stalled.  Although stall recovery was eventually effected and the airplane was leveled at FL300, the lack of appropriate thrust and control column inputs following the stall delayed the recovery.  Evidence from the investigation indicates that anomalies of the captain's airspeed indicator were caused by a partial and intermittent blockage of the captain's pitot tube.  The reason for the blockage was not determined.   ",
            "probable_cause": "The captain's improper procedures regarding stall avoidance and recovery.  Contributing to the incident were the partial blockage of the pitot static system, and the flight crew's improper decisions regarding their use of inaccurate airspeed indications.  Contributing to the flight crew's confusion during the flight were the indistinct alerts generated by the airplane's crew alerting system.   "

The aircraft entered an approximate 40 degree nose high climb rate to about 1,000 feet.  The aircraft then entered a steep left hand banking turn.  The nose dropped and the aircraft rotated up to about 4 times before colliding with the flat terrain adjacent to the departure end of the runway threshold.   On site documentation of the airframe found no evidence of a flight control malfunction.  An engine examination and teardown found that the gearbox section of the left engine experienced a high cycle fatigue failure of the high speed pinion journal bearing oil supply tube and subsequent degradation of the high speed pinion journal bearings.  This failure resulted in a partial power loss to the left engine.   The pilot had recently purchased this aircraft and he had accumulated approximately 11 hours since the purchase.

Performance calculations indicated that the aircraft was capable of lifting off where the witnesses observed and climbing to 1,000 feet agl by the end of the runway.  To achieve this performance the aircraft would have rotated at approximately 84 KCAS and climbed at an airspeed below Vmc (100 KCAS) and close to power-off stall speed (86 KCAS) with 5 degrees of flaps.  The airplane's flight manual indicated that if an engine failure occurs in the takeoff climb and the landing gear is fully retracted, the emergency procedures is to maintain 140 KCAS, flaps to 5 degrees, the failed engine condition lever to EMERGENCY STOP, and failed engine power lever to TAKEOFF.

Thereafter he began a descent from cruise flight into instrument meteorological conditions. The controller cleared the airplane for the approach about 20 miles north of the airport. The airplane then began a descending right turn and the pilot requested, and was provided, vectors to another airport. While en-route to that airport, he amended his request and asked for vectors to a third airport, stating that he required an airport with an instrument landing system (ILS) approach. The controller subsequently provided vectors, followed by an ILS approach clearance. Shortly after receiving the clearance, the airplane flew past the ILS localizer path, and the controller cancelled the approach clearance. The pilot then requested an airport with cloud bases 2,000 feet or better, and the controller advised him to check the weather at a nearby airport. The airplane then began a rapid descending right turn, followed by a steep climbing right turn. The airplane then began another rapid descent and was destroyed when it collided with wooded terrain. Throughout the approach portions of the flight, the airplane deviated multiple times from assigned altitudes and headings. The airplane was equipped with a liquid crystal display avionics suite, in a configuration commonly referred to as a \"glass cockpit.\" No logbook entries were noted indicating that the instrument-rated pilot had flight experience in the accident airplane, and the majority of his flight experience in IMC took place in his own airplane, which was equipped with conventional flight instruments.

The airplane's turning ground track and the cloud conditions were conducive to the onset of pilot spatial disorientation. The airplane's multiple, rapid ascents and descents are consistent with the pilot's loss of control of the airplane because of spatial disorientation. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command's in-flight loss of control due to spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident were the weather conditions and the pilot-in-command's lack of flight experience in the accident airplane."

About two seconds later, the engine quit and could not be started. The pilot elected to attempt the forced landing in an alfalfa field that was straight ahead of him. The aircraft initially touched down in the alfalfa, but bounced back into the air and touched down a second time in an area that had been freshly plowed. The main gear sank into the soft dirt and the aircraft nosed over. During the post-accident engine inspection, the engine would not start until the carburetor had been struck a couple of time with a hammer. After the carburetor was jarred by the hammer, the engine started and was able to be test run.

The airplane's wreckage was located in mountainous terrain at 8,344 feet mean sea level (msl), 9 miles west of the destination airport. Recorded flight parameter data from the airplane's electronic primary flight display revealed a steady recorded altitude of 8,400 feet for about the last 3 minutes of the flight. Two airmen's meteorological information reports (AIRMETs), both issued about 90 minutes prior to the accident, advised of mountains occasionally obscured by clouds and precipitation, and the presence of turbulence and low-level windshear. Weather observations for the destination airport at 2050 and 2110, which was just prior to the airplane's departure, reported cloud ceilings at 8,400 feet and 7,600 feet msl, respectively. Scattered clouds were reported on the 2130 observation at 7,600 feet and 8,100 feet msl. Based on an analysis of satellite weather data and destination airport weather observations conducted by a Safety Board meteorologist, it is likely that the pilot encountered clouds and turbulence at his flight altitude shortly after 2121 and descended in order to maintain visual flight rules flight.

The Cheyenne departed under visual flight rules (VFR) from a local airport northwest of Denver, and was proceeding direct at 7,800 feet to another local airport south of Denver. Radar indicated its ground speed was 230 knots. Its altitude encoder was transmitting intermittently. The Skyhawk departed VFR from the south airport and was en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, at 7,300 feet. The pilot requested and was cleared to climb to 8,500 feet and penetrate class B airspace. Radar indicated its ground speed was 110 knots. The Skyhawk was flying in the suggested \"VFR flyway\"; the Cheyenne was not. When the controller observed the two airplanes converging, he asked the pilot of the Cheyenne for his altitude. He replied he was at 7,600 feet. The controller immediately issued a traffic advisory, but the pilot did not acknowledge.  Both airplanes departed controlled flight: the Skyhawk struck a house, and the Cheyenne fell inverted into the backyard of a residence. Wreckage was scattered over a 24 square block area in west Denver. At the time of the accident, the controller was handling low altitude en route, arrival and departure traffic for both airports. Wreckage examination disclosed four slashes, consistent with propeller strikes, on top of the Cheyenne's  right engine nacelle, the cabin above the right wing trailing edge, the empennage at the root of the dorsal fin, and at the tail cone.  The Cheyenne was on a similar flight three days before the collision when the pilot was informed by air traffic control that the transponder was operating intermittently.   According to recorded radar and voice communications from that flight, the transponder/encoder operated intermittently and the pilot was so advised.

The pilot accepted the flight and, about 2 hours later, was on an instrument approach to the airport to pick up the patient.  While on the instrument approach, all of the anti-ice and deice systems were turned on. The pilot said that the deice boots seemed to be shedding the ice almost completely. He extended the flaps and lowered the landing gear to descend; he then added power, but the airspeed continued to decrease. The airplane continued to descend, and he raised the flaps and landing gear and applied full climb power. The airplane shuddered as it climbed, and the airspeed continued to decrease. The stall warning horn came on, and the pilot lowered the nose to increase the airspeed. The airplane descended until it impacted level, snow-covered terrain.The airplane was equipped with satellite tracking and engine and flight control monitoring. The minimum safe operating speed for the airplane in continuous icing conditions is 140 knots indicated airspeed. The airplane's IAS dropped below 140 knots 4 minutes prior to impact. During the last 1 minute of flight, the indicated airspeed varied from a high of 124.5 knots to a low of 64.6 knots, and the vertical speed varied from +1,965 feet per minute to -2,464 feet per minute. The last data recorded prior to the impact showed that the airplane was at an indicated airspeed of 68 knots, descending at 1,651 feet per minute, and the nose was pitched up at 20 degrees. The pilot did not indicate that there were any mechanical issues with the airplane.The chief pilot reported that pilots are on call for 14 consecutive 24-hour periods before receiving two weeks off. He said that the accident pilot had worked the previous day but that the pilot stated that he was rested enough to accept the mission. The chief pilot indicated he was aware that sleep cycles and circadian rhythms are disturbed by varied and prolonged activity.An NTSB study found that pilots with more than 12 hours of time since waking made significantly more procedural and tactical decision errors than pilots with less than 12 hours of time since waking. A 2000 FAA study found accidents to be more prevalent among pilots who had been on duty for more than 10 hours, and a study by the U.S. Naval Safety Center found that pilots who were on duty for more than 10 of the last 24 hours were more likely to be involved in pilot-at-fault accidents than pilots who had less duty time.The operator\u2019s management stated that they do not prioritize patient transportation with regard to their medical condition but base their decision to transport on a request from medical staff and availability of a pilot and aircraft, and suitable weather. The morning of the accident, the patient subsequently took a commercial flight to another hospital to receive medical treatment for his non-critical injury/illness. Given the long duty day and the early morning departure time of the flight, it is likely the pilot experienced significant levels of fatigue that substantially degraded his ability to monitor the airplane during a dark night instrument flight in icing conditions.The NTSB has issued numerous recommendations to improve emergency medical services aviation operations. One safety recommendation (A-06-13) addresses the importance of conducting a thorough risk assessment before accepting a flight. The safety recommendation asked the Federal Aviation Administration to \"require all emergency medical services (EMS) operators to develop and implement flight risk evaluation programs that include training all employees involved in the operation, procedures that support the systematic evaluation of flight risks, and consultation with others trained in EMS flight operations if the risks reach a predefined level.\" Had such a thorough risk assessment been performed, the decision to launch a fatigued pilot into icing conditions late at night may have been different or additional precautions may have been taken to alleviate the risk.The NTSB is also concerned that the pressure to conduct EMS operations safely and quickly in various environmental conditions (for example, in inclement weather and at night) increases the risk of accidents when compared to other types of patient transport methods, including ground ambulances or commercial flights. However, guidelines vary greatly for determining the mode of and need for transportation. Thus, the NTSB recommended, in safety recommendation A-09-103, that the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS) \"develop national guidelines for the selection of appropriate emergency transportation modes for urgent care.\" The most recent correspondence from FICEMS indicated that the guidelines are close to being finalized and distributed to members. Such guidance will help hospitals and physicians assess the appropriate mode of transport for patients.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot did not maintain sufficient airspeed during an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of control. Contributing to the accident were the pilot\u2019s fatigue, the operator\u2019s decision to initiate the flight without conducting a formal risk assessment that included time of day, weather, and crew rest, and the lack of guidelines for the medical community to determine the appropriate mode of transportation for patients."

During the demonstration, the CFI reduced engine power to idle from an altitude of 2,000 feet mean sea level and executed a descent to an altitude of about 5 - 6 feet above ground level at 60 knots indicated airspeed. The CFI did not increase engine throttle during this descent to clear the engine. The CFI applied full throttle during the go-around, but the engine hesitated and the airplane continued to descend.

After about ten minutes of maneuvering around the area, the helicopter experienced a complete loss of engine power, and the pilot attempted an autorotation to the backyard of a residence about one-half mile from his own. During the last part of the attempted forced landing, the helicopter collided with a tree and a wood fence. The investigation did not reveal any anomalies or malfunctions that would have prevented the engine from operating normally, and the engine underwent a successful post-accident dynamometer test run. The investigation revealed that the flight took place during ambient conditions that would be expected to produce carburetor icing, and under which the pilot would need to constantly monitor the carburetor temperature gauge and make adjustments to the carburetor heat. The pilot had a history of seasonal allergies, and toxicology test results were consistent with the recent use of diphenhydramine, a sedating and impairing over-the-counter antihistamine often known by the trade name of Benadryl. The extent to which impairment from the medication may have played a role in the accident could not be determined.",

Although two maintenance shops had attempted to correct the problem, as of the date of the accident, the system was still not functioning correctly. During this two-month period, the pilot had continued to operate the aircraft, turning on the master switch only during engine start and for brief periods of radio transmission. On the day of the accident, he turned on the master switch to start the engine, and then not realizing that he had not turned it off, headed for his destination. About 10 minutes after takeoff, the pilot smelled what he thought was either smoke or fumes from a malfunctioning heater, and elected to make a precautionary landing. While attempting to land in an open area near a county road, the aircraft collided with a power line that the pilot was trying to go under in order to get to the point where he wanted to touch down. After hitting the power line, and with the fumes getting stronger, the pilot tried to get the aircraft on the ground as quickly as possible. As a result, the aircraft touched down at an excessive descent rate, and both main gear collapsed. Immediately after exiting the aircraft, the pilot noticed a small fire in the right wing root. He elected not to approach the aircraft to attempt to put out the fire, and it was eventually consumed by the flames. ",

The certified private pilot sustained serious injuries, and the sole passenger received fatal injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed. The personal cross-country flight, which was being operated in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, departed the San Bernardino International Airport (SBD), San Bernardino, California, about 1630, with MYF as its destination.In an interview with investigators conducted on the day following the accident, the pilot reported that the airplane bounced on landing and she added full power and commenced a go-around; the retractable landing gear and flaps remained in the extended position. Moments later when she realized that she was not gaining altitude as she normally would, she communicated the situation to the MYF air traffic control tower; the pilot also indicated that the engine was not making full power. She then veered left toward a shopping complex, which she indicated was a contingency landing area if she ever experienced an emergency. The airplane subsequently impacted a roof-mounted air conditioning unit atop a commercial building, proceeded straight ahead for about 40 feet, impacted the cinder block wall barrier on the south side of the building with its forward undercarriage, and then impacted one of the building's perimeter light standards with its right wing. The airplane subsequently came to rest in an open parking area on the west side of the building. A fire ensued on the right-front portion of the airplane, which was quickly extinguished by local workers in the area.A witness, who is also a pilot and was standing about 450 feet south of the runway with an unobstructed view of the airplane while on its go-around, reported that the aircraft was very low as it approached the west perimeter of the airport. The witness stated that it then pulled up to clear a row of trees in its path, and subsequently pulled up even steeper to clear some higher trees. The witness added that at this point the airplane's left wing dropped, which was immediately followed by the nose dropping, but it did not stall and did not spin. The witness opined that shortly after losing sight of the airplane to the west of his location, he observed a column of smoke in that direction.A survey of the accident site by the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge and representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration, revealed that the airplane, with the exception of a section of the right wing's leading edge and all three landing gear, was basically observed intact, upright, and oriented on a heading of north.The airplane was recovered to a secured storage facility for further examination.",

A review of engine maintenance records revealed that no maintenance had been performed on the engine that would have required breaking of crankcase thru-bolt torques (such as cylinder removal) since its most recent overhaul, which was completed more than 3 years and 314 flight hours before the accident flight. The reason for the engine failure could not be determined because of the impact and postaccident fire damage.Examination of the wreckage revealed that the landing gear was in the down and locked position, the left engine propeller blades were in the feathered position, and the left fuel selector valve was in the off position. Examination of the manufacturer's Pilot Operating Handbook revealed that if properly configured, with the landing gear retracted, the airplane would have been capable of a 500 foot-per-minute rate of climb with only one operating engine on the day of the accident. As found, the airplane was not configured in accordance with the after-takeoff checklist or the engine failure after takeoff checklist.",

A witness said he saw the airplane \"in a high left bank like it was trying to land on runway 15. Suddenly, the plane made an abrupt (steep) descent (approximately 45 degrees) nose down. About 50 feet above the ground, it seemed the pilot tried to level off. The plane impacted the ground at a lower angle of attack (I would say 15-20 degrees). An FAA inspector, who was at the airport but did not witness the accident, immediately responded to the accident site. He said he found the fuel selector valve on the left tank and the left fuel tank was empty. The right fuel tank contained approximately \"one inch\" of fuel. One blade of the propeller was bent under the engine cowling, and the other was slightly damaged. The engine had been extensively modified. Disassembly revealed continuity and compression of all cylinders. The left magneto produced spark when turned. In place of a right magneto, the airplane was equipped with an automotive electronic ignition. All eight spark plugs were of the automotive-type. There was no fuel in the engine-driven fuel pump, electrically-driven fuel pump, or fuel injectors. The engine data recorder was sent to the manufacturer. Data downloaded was found to be corrupt and meaningless.",

The pilot was able to free himself, despite serious injuries. The pilot reported that, at an unspecified date before the accident, he replaced the bridle with a different design than the original. During a flight after the bridle change but before the accident flight, the new bridle became caught on part of the airframe. The pilot was able to reach back to free the bridle and avoid a loss of control. Neither the bridle nor the airframe was modified in the period between the earlier event and the accident flight. Because the bridle and suspension cables significantly change their angles and positions relative to the chassis as the parachute inflates during the takeoff roll, it is critical that the design precludes the possibility for any cable to get caught on the airframe during that process; such capture could result in a misinflated or misaligned parachute, rendering control difficult or impossible. Neither the aircraft nor the bridle was examined after the accident, and the pilot did not provide detailed information regarding the design of the bridle or airframe structure. Therefore, although information provided by the pilot suggests that the bridle again caught on the airframe, the specific reason(s) for the capture could not be determined.",
            "probable_cause": "The unintended capture of the parachute bridle on a portion of the airframe during the takeoff roll, which resulted in a misinflated or misaligned parachute and an in-flight loss of control."

The captain advised the flight attendants to have the cabin secured and be in their seats within 15 minutes.  The first officer gave the 'prepare for landing' announcement in the descent around flight level FL250 (25,000 feet), which was after the captain had notified the flight attendants to prepare the cabin, but before the end of the stated 15 minutes.  While descending through 15,500 feet, the airplane experienced a moderate 'jolt' lasting 1-2 seconds.  By this time it had been more than 15 minutes since the captain gave the flight attendants the secure cabin instructions.  The cabin crew reported injuries to all flight attendants and no injuries to passengers.  All six flight attendants received medical attention after landing.  One flight attendant was seriously injured with a closed fibular fracture; the five other flight attendants had minor injuries.  The first officer said that turbulence during their departure had been very bad, therefore, in order to mitigate any passenger anxiety, when he made the 'prepare for landing' announcement, he added that the turbulence would not be as bad as it was on departure.  He understood the captain's instructions to the flight attendants, and this announcement was aimed solely at the passengers. The flight attendants confirmed that they understood the captain's instructions to have the cabin cleaned up and be seated within 15 minutes.  As they were finishing the cabin clean up, the first officer's 'prepare for landing' announcement indicated that the turbulence would not be as bad as they had been told to expect.  The flight attendants may have interpreted this added information concerning turbulence as a relaxation of the captain's earlier instructions.  The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) indicated the turbulence occurred as the aircraft was coming out of a 12-degree right bank and descending through 15,400 pressure altitude.  The event lasted approximately 10-11 seconds.  The bank angle of the aircraft was between 8 and 1 degrees right wing down during the event.  Vertical acceleration fluctuated between .5 and 2.06 G's.  Longitudinal acceleration spiked up to .2 G's about the same time as the 2 G vertical spike.  Lateral acceleration fluctuated between .1 G left and .05 G's to the right during the incident.

Another airplane had just landed on runway 13, and with the weather information, he determined that he would take off on runway 13.  The pilot said that he used a short-field takeoff technique with zero flaps, and the airplane encountered a wind gust and windshear conditions. The engine momentarily lost power and sputtered, and he checked the mixture control to make sure that it was at the full rich position and that the throttle was in. He maneuvered to avoid power lines and a circular agricultural irrigation system. The airplane then quickly lost altitude and the pilot nosed the airplane over to avoid a stall.  The airplane impacted terrain about 2,850 feet from the end of runway 13, and approximately 1,000 feet to the right of runway centerline, damaging the firewall, wings, and crushing the fuselage bottom. Examination of the airframe, engine, and its fuel control unit identified no preexisting anomalies. The 4,984-foot-long paved runway had an uphill gradient of 1.5 percent and was at an elevation of 5,863 feet. The reported wind at the airport was from 330 degrees at 8 knots, gusting to 14 knots.

He further reported that the sky conditions were clear and that he observed no windshear or hazardous conditions around the airport. The terrain surrounding the airport was flat agricultural land, which was gently rising to the south, about 150 feet per nautical mile. The airplane was near its maximum gross weight. The Pilot's Operating Handbook for the airplane states that prior to takeoff from fields above 3,000 feet elevation, the mixture should be leaned to give maximum rpm in a full throttle, static run up. According to the engine manufacturer, if the engine is properly leaned for a density altitude of 7,457 feet, the normally aspirated engine's maximum output of 180 horsepower (hp) would be reduced to 138 hp. Since the engine was not leaned, but was operating at full rich mixture, its output would have been reduced even further, thus not allowing the airplane to outclimb the rising terrain for the existing conditions.",
