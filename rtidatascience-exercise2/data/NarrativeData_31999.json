Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. No flight plan was filed. The departure airport, time of departure, and destination airport are unknown.  A witness who lived near the accident site reported the he heard the airplane approaching from the east and he went outside to observe the airplane. He saw the airplane making two left hand circles overhead about 200 to 300 feet above ground level. He could see the pilot wearing a headset and sunglasses. The engine was running normally and was \"revved out.\" The witness reported that on the third circle, the airplane \"floated.\" He stated that the pilot was turning the airplane by using the rudder, and the wings were not banked to the left and the airspeed was low. He reported that the engine noise stopped, and the airplane flipped over to the left and went straight down. He reported that the nose of airplane rose slightly before ground impact.The examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted the terrain on a heading of 055 degrees magnetic. The wreckage was about 12 feet from the initial impact point and was inverted. The wreckage exhibited significant crushing and buckling, but it was largely intact. The nose wheel was pushed aft. The leading edges and the bottoms of the left and right wings exhibited aft crushing and buckling. The cockpit was crushed aft and the floorboards had been cut by the first responders. The fuselage and empennage exhibited buckling, but the horizontal and vertical stabilizers received minimal damage. The check of the flight controls revealed that the rudder cables exhibited continuity from the rudder pedals to the rudder bellcrank. The elevator push/pull tube was separated at the bottom of the control stick with a fracture surface consistent with overload; otherwise, the elevator cables and attach points exhibited continuity. The aileron control system exhibited continuity from the control stick to the attach points on the left and right ailerons. The leading edges of the three-bladed composite propeller blades revealed minimal damage. One blade remained attached to the propeller hub and it was not visibly damaged. One blade was separated from the propeller hub at the base of the blade. No other damage was noted. The third blade was broken about 10 inches from the blade root. The engine exhibited minimal damage. The crankshaft was rotated and thumb compression and suction were confirmed on all four cylinders.   The cockpit fuel selector was found on the right tank. Both the fuel tanks were inverted and had little fuel in either tank when examined. The right tank had less that a pint of fuel drained from it. The ground underneath both fuel tanks was examined; it was wet and smelled like aviation fuel.   The examination of the wreckage revealed that almost the entire airplane had been painted white. There were no aircraft registration numbers painted on the sides or tail of the airplane. The airplane's data plate indicated that the Federal Aviation Administration's register number for the airplane was N95MH.

The pilot landed the helicopter safely on the water with the floats fully inflated.  Shortly thereafter, a large wave impacted the helicopter and broke out the right windshield and rolled the helicopter inverted.  The pilot and the passenger were able to exit the helicopter and deploy one of the on-board life rafts.  They were later rescued by a local boat and the USCG.  Examination of the engine revealed the power turbine (PT) outer shaft was intact; however, there were two spiral fractures observed on the shaft.  One spiral fracture was approximately 3-inches-long and originated between a crack within one curvic tooth and the mid-shaft.  At the mid-shaft location, as the shaft wall thickens, the spiral direction changed 90 degrees and continued for approximately another half-inch. The second spiral fracture was approximately 180 degrees from the first and was approximately one half-inch in length with one end starting at the root of a curvic tooth. The loaded faces of the curvic-coupling teeth were galled. The fourth stage turbine connector nut was in its proper location and appeared to be undamaged. The deformable lock feature was still engaged with the nut. The easy removal of the nut from the shaft was hampered by the presence of a piece of curvic tooth fragment that was wedged between the nut and the shaft. Once the tooth fragment was removed, the nut rotated freely and was removed. The ring described by the forward face of the shaft, exhibited areas of polishing consistent with contact against the ring described by the aft face of the pinion gear.  According to the Rolls-Royce metallurgical examination report, the fracture surfaces exhibited evidence of fatigue.  The manufacturer also stated that there have been 16 other instances where the power turbine outer shaft had cracked since 1990; however, none of these resulted in an engine shut down.  The only damage noted in these cases was fretting on the mating wheel.  Each of the cracks initiated in the curvic coupling, and fretting was found at the fracture origin.  The fretting was attributed to a loss of clamp load either from inadequate torque on the PT nut, or raised metal on the curvics that prevented proper seating.  As a result of these 16 events, and prior to the PHI accident, Rolls Royce implemented several mitigating actions to prevent a future occurrence.  These included changes to the assembly process, enhanced instructions in the overhaul manual on better handling practices to better protect the curvic couplings. The source of the fractures could not be determined.",

As the airplane began to ascend, witnesses observed the acrylic canopy separate in fragments from the airplane.  The airplane continued to climb before it rolled to the right and entered an approximate 60-degree nose-down descent.  The engine remained at full power during the descent and no flight control movements were observed after the canopy had separated.  A witness made several attempts to contact the pilot via radio, but there was no response.  Examination of the canopy revealed that it fastened to the fuselage by two metal hinges that fastened directly to the fuselage with four flat-head bolts. There was no evidence of bonding material or adhesive in the area of the fuselage underneath the mounting plate of either hinge.  The forward hinge was never located; however, a closer view of the location where the front canopy hinge was located indicated there were \"rub\" marks on the surface of the fuselage underneath the hinge pin lock wire, which was indicative to contact wear with the bent end of the hinge pin. The hinge pin lock wire was also worn and flattened in areas, which corresponded to contact wear with the bent end of the hinge pin.  The rear hinge was fractured into two pieces through the mounting plate at the fuselage side of the hinge.  Deformation was observed around the rivet holes where the hinge was attached to the fuselage, indicative of overstress.  Bolt holes in the mounting plate at the canopy side of the hinge were deformed, and the edges of the holes were cracked or fractured, consistent with overstress.

During a postincident inspection, maintenance personnel discovered a broken landing gear pivot pin on the right main landing gear truck.  The landing gear bogie pivot pin was removed from the incident airplane's main landing gear bogie beam.  A residual amount of dried grease was noted on the fractured pivot pin and associated bogie beam bushings.  A senior materials engineer from the NTSB's Materials Laboratory reported that most of the chromium plating was missing from the pin's shank, and the underlying steel was worn, corroded, and displayed signs of heat damage.  He noted that the originating fracture region contained corrosion pits.  The fracture features noted are typical of stress corrosion cracking.  The airplane's flight data recorder (FDR) showed that the incident landing was within normal operating tolerances.  On April 8, 2004, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group issued Alert Service Bulletin 767-32A0199, which requires the replacement of the current pivot pins with pins made of a different type of steel.

After an uneventful landing, the pilot performed an engine run-up and more troubleshooting steps and was unable to replicate the engine problem. The pilot then decided to depart for the home airport; however, shortly after departure, the engine speed variations began again, eventually resulting in a total loss of engine power. The pilot performed a forced landing in a nearby field, where the majority of the airplane, including most of its fuel supply system, was consumed by postimpact fire.

He approached the grass strip from the south and established the airplane on final approach at 65 mph and a vertical descent rate of 200 to 300 feet per minute (fpm).  On short final, the pilot established the airplane at 60 mph (about 10 mph above stall speed) with 40 degrees of flaps extended.  As the airplane passed the stand of trees it dropped 10 to 12 feet and landed hard about 90 feet short of the pilot's intended touchdown point.  After engine shutdown, the pilot noticed the control column was jammed to the far aft position and locked against the rear of the instrument panel.  Post-event examination of the airplane revealed the firewall was displaced aft about 3 inches.",

According to air traffic control radar and voice data, the airplane maintained a parallel course, left of the runway centerline, for the entire approach, and when it was about 3 miles from the end of the runway, it descended below the glideslope. The air traffic controller issued two low altitude alerts over the next few minutes, after which the pilot acknowledged and initiated a climb. During the second climb, the ground speed decreased, and the pilot banked to the right and then sharply to the left. The groundspeed continued to decrease until the airplane stalled and impacted a grass area about 1 mile from the end of the runway. Witnesses reported the airplane appeared to be aligned with a parallel (center) runway, instead of the (left) runway the pilot was cleared for, when it descended from below the cloud layer. The pilot, who was also a co-owner of the airplane, had a significant amount of total and instrument flight experience. He flew the accident airplane exclusively for the previous 11 years, and had conducted numerous instrument approaches at his home airport. Weight and balance calculations revealed, at the time of the accident the airplane center of gravity was at about 99.26 inches aft of the airplane datum or approximately 3.26 inches aft of the rear center of gravity (CG) limit. The pilot had a long history of significant liver disease (cirrhosis) as a result of chronic hepatitis C, and was apparently experiencing symptoms of insomnia and lethargy possibly related to his liver disease. He was regularly prescribed (for sleep) an evening dose of a potentially impairing medication (clonazepam) typically contraindicated in significant liver disease and a daily dose of a wakefulness-promoting medication (modafanil). The pilot and his physician had omitted information regarding the pilot's known cirrhosis, symptoms, and use of medications in information submitted to the FAA. Evidence of actively worsening liver disease was noted on autopsy. It is possible that the pilot's judgment and/or performance were somewhat impaired by chronic effects of hepatitis C or by the effect of a sudden deterioration in his condition. It is also possible the pilot may have been impaired as a result of his use of a prescription medication for sleep, particularly given that the metabolism of that medication may have been adversely affected by his liver disease. An inactive marijuana metabolite was detected in the pilot's urine on post-mortem toxicological testing, suggesting only that the pilot had used marijuana sometime in the previous days or weeks.",

A witness at the departure airport reported hearing a rough running engine as the airplane took off. About 5 minutes later, the airplane entered the traffic pattern at another airport. Witnesses at the arrival airport reported hearing a rough running engine as the airplane entered the traffic pattern. They observed the airplane turn left from the base leg to final approach for the runway. As the airplane turned to align with the extended runway centerline, its bank angle increased to near 90 degrees. This steep turn was likely performed by the pilot to correct for overshooting the runway\u2019s extended centerline. The nose of the airplane dropped, and the airplane rapidly descended and impacted terrain. Signatures at the accident site and statements from the witnesses were consistent with an aerodynamic stall. Although the pilot had about 9,500 hours of experience, this was his first flight piloting this airplane, thus he likely was not familiar with it's handling characteristics. Therefore, it is likely that the pilot overshot the centerline due to his lack of experience in the airplane and the distraction of the rough running engine. In a 2012 safety study on \"The Safety of Experimental Amateur-Built Aircraft,\" the NTSB concluded that \"purchasers of used [experimental amateur-built] (E-AB)aircraft face particular challenges in transitioning to the unfamiliar E-AB aircraft. Like builders of new E-AB aircraft, they must learn to manage the unique handling characteristics of their aircraft and learn the systems, structure, and equipment, but without the firsthand knowledge afforded to the builder.\" Thus, the NTSB recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration and the Experimental Aircraft Association \"complete planned action to create a coalition of kit manufacturers, type clubs, and pilot and owner groups and (1) develop transition training resources and (2) identify and apply incentives to encourage both builders of experimental amateur-built aircraft and purchasers of used experimental amateur-built aircraft to complete the training that is developed.\"A postaccident examination of the airframe did not detect any anomalies. An examination of the engine revealed that the fuel servo exceeded all of the manufacturer\u2019s recommended maximum flowmeter limits, which would have resulted in a rich mixture. However, it could not be determined whether the discrepancy with the fuel servo was significant enough to result in a rough running engine.  No other anomalies were detected with the engine.",

Contributing to the accident were the pilot\u2019s lack of experience in the airplane and the pilot\u2019s distracted attention to the rough running engine."

The local solo instructional flight was operating in the traffic pattern at Manassas Regional Airport (HEF), Manassas, Virginia and was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.A preliminary review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control communication records indicated that the airplane had been operating in the traffic pattern at HEF for runway 16R. As the airplane made a base leg to final approach leg turn, the pilot advised that she was going to perform a go around. The tower controller acknowledged and provided a clearance to fly right closed traffic. About 4 minutes later, while on the downwind leg, the controller advised the pilot that she appeared to be low, and asked if she required assistance. The pilot indicated that she did, and the controller advised her to climb to 1,000 feet and continue the downwind leg. The pilot's response was unintelligible, and the controller again advised the pilot to climb to 1,000 feet. The pilot responded \"I think I'm going too fast, I need [unintelligible]\".

Hawaii Flight Academy was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.  The certified flight instructor (CFI), student pilot undergoing instruction (PUI), and one passenger sustained serious injuries; the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The local instructional flight departed Hilo about 1350.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.The operator reported that the CFI was instructing the student pilot in preparation for his private pilot practical examination. The passenger was another student pilot who was observing the training flight.The flight crew reported that they had drained a lot of water out of the fuel tanks prior to the flight. They departed and flew for about 1 hour, and returned to ITO to practice touch-and-go landings. They made an aggressive slip on the first touch-and-go. After applying power they were about 50-100 feet agl when the engine lost all power.The CFI took control of the airplane and executed a left turn away from the buildings, which were located towards the end of the runway. The airplane impacted onto the grass area northeast of the departure end of runway 03.Postaccident examination of the airplane fuel system revealed about 8 oz of fluid, which was drained from the fuel sump strainer, 5 oz of which appeared to be water. The carburetor was removed from the engine and an unmeasured amount of fluid was drained from the carburetor, which appeared to be 90% water.

About 10 feet above the ground, and after about 270 degrees of yaw, the helicopter descended rapidly and impacted the ground, seriously injuring the passenger.  Examination of the helicopter following the accident revealed that the tail rotor had sustained impact damage to both blades, and that the tail rotor drive shaft was fractured at the coupling hub.  Examination of the fractured portions of the coupling hub revealed signatures consistent with a torsional event, such as a tail rotor strike, and no evidence that the fracture surfaces were rubbing against each other under power.  According to Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 90-95, loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) events typically occur in a low airspeed flight regime while maneuvering, such as on final approach to landing.  Any maneuver that requires the pilot to operate at high-power, at low airspeed, and with a left crosswind or tailwind, creates an environment where unanticipated right yaw may occur.  Additional factors that can influence the severity of the onset of LTE include increases in gross weight and density altitude, low indicated airspeeds, and power droop.  Recovery from an LTE event should include the application of full left pedal, while simultaneously moving the cyclic forward to increase speed, and altitude permitting, a reduction in power.",

The pilot switched fuel tanks, turned on the auxiliary fuel pump, and richened the mixture.  He noted that the fuel flow stabilized briefly, and then it started varying again.  Shortly thereafter, the engine quit, and the pilot made a forced landing on a dirt road.  At that time, he turned the fuel pump off, and made the landing with the gear down and flaps extended.  The airplane touched down successfully on the main landing gear.  During the rollout, a wing clipped a metal post, which spun the airplane into a ditch.

The airplane began the takeoff roll, and after about 100 feet down the road, the pilot's seat slid back abruptly to the full aft position. Because his right hand was positioned on the power lever for takeoff, the pilot inadvertently retarded the lever to the idle position as the seat slid aft.

At that time, he installed an overhauled carburetor.  He indicated that during attempts to run the engine, after the accident, the engine would start and run at idle power.  He noticed a binding of the carburetor's throttle cable or internal carburetor linkage.  He replaced the throttle cable, but still felt a binding in the throttle mechanism.  The pilot said he disconnected the throttle cable from the carburetor, and hand operated the throttle arm.  It had binding only when the engine was running.

Although the air traffic controller whom he was communicating with advised the pilot that there was an airport with VMC a short distance behind him, the pilot elected to attempt to proceed to his destination. As he continued, weather conditions became such that the pilot elected to land at an alternate airport. While being vectored to the alternate airport, the airplane's engine began to run rough, which, according to recorded engine analyzer data, was due to a restriction of the fuel flow in the orifice of the no. 1 cylinder injector nozzle. While attempting to deal with the rough running engine and maneuvering toward the alternate airport, the pilot inadvertently entered the clouds, and most likely lost control of the airplane due to spatial disorientation. The airplane then descended near vertically into the terrain.

The pilot opted not to land at either of the first two planned stops, because she was uncomfortable with the winds at the time of her arrival at each. The third intended destination airport was situated at the shore of a lake. The turf runway was oriented approximately perpendicular to the shoreline, terminated at the shoreline, and was sloped uphill away from the lake. Tall trees and rapidly rising terrain at the other end of the runway resulted in the runway being effectively one way in and one way out, over the lake. The winds were light and variable, and the pilot landed uneventfully at that airstrip. She taxied to the far end, turned around, and began the takeoff roll downhill, towards the lake. She brought the tail up, continued the takeoff roll, and the airplane became prematurely airborne after \"rolling over one of the bumpy spots\" on the runway. The pilot reported that she tried to fly in ground effect to build airspeed, but lowered the nose too far. The propeller struck the runway, which degraded the airplane performance, and prevented the airplane from successfully climbing. The pilot determined that at that point, she was too far down the runway to safely abort the takeoff on the remaining runway, so she sought a spot straight ahead on the exposed lakebed on which to land the airplane. The pilot steered the airplane towards what appeared to be a dry area that was clear of debris. The airplane struck the dry upslope on the main wheels, and the left main gear impacted a tree stump.

Blue streaking and staining, consistent in color with 100 low lead aviation fuel, was noted on the ventral surfaces of the aircraft.  Examination of the aircraft's fuel bladder revealed that the plastic interconnect nipple for the vent line, and the plastic interconnect nipple for the fuel return line, located at the distal end of the aircraft's fuel bladder, were fractured.  Further examination of the fuel bladder revealed approximately 20 preexisting holes in the bladder's fabric.  The aircraft's maintenance logbook indicated that the aircraft was equipped with a strobe light kit.  Examination of the strobe light system revealed that the installation of the strobe kit was not in accordance with the manufacture's installation instructions.  Instead, the wiring harness for the strobe light was routed parallel to a stringer, between the wing ribs and the skin of the aircraft.

About 5 miles from the airport, the engine emitted a loud noise and he declared an emergency due to an engine failure.  Realizing that he would be unable to make it to the runway, the pilot executed a forced landing in a field; during the landing roll, the airplane impacted a ditch and tumbled.  Post-accident external visual examination by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the engine sustained a catastrophic failure, with a hole knocked in the upper case spine above the rear cylinders.  Looking through the hole, the inspector observed that the right rear piston had seized in the No. 3 cylinder and its respective connecting rod was broken just above crankshaft rod end flare.  The inspector could not identify the rod end cap or the bearing shells.  The No. 3 piston skirt was visibly scorched in the direction of piston travel.  A visual examination of the engine, disclosed that all of the cylinders were worn and scored.  After the accident, the owner took the engine to a maintenance facility that examined the engine and reported that rod bearing in the No. 3 cylinder failed.  The facility declined to provide detailed observations on the internal condition of the engine, the rod fracture, and condition of the bearing.  The FAA inspector said the pilot told him that prior to the accident, the engine was experiencing excessive oil consumption.  In response, the pilot removed the No. 3 cylinder from the engine and employed an engine shop to change the piston in an effort to alleviate the excessive oil consumption problems.

About the time the airplane departed witnesses heard an airplane circling overhead, making a number of passes 2 miles to the northeast of the airport, and then heard the airplane impact the ground and saw a fireball. The circling flight path is consistent with the pilot's known departure habits of circling over the airport to gain sufficient altitude to clear the mountainous terrain surrounding the airport. The witnesses did not see the airplane before it impacted the ground because of the snow and low visibility at the time. The pilot was instructed in his clearance to contact the air traffic control (ATC) center after departure, but ATC center personnel reported that they never received a check-in radio call from the pilot. The weather at the airport about the time of the accident included winds from 140 degrees at 6 knots gusting to 15 knots, 1/2-mile visibility with a 200-foot overcast ceiling, and an outside air temperature of 1 degree Celsius. The wreckage of the entire airplane was contained in the vicinity of the initial ground impact and no ground scars or debris were found leading up to the wreckage. Examination of the airplane's wings showed leading edge crushing along the entire length of both wings, and the wing skin was crushed accordion-style longitudinally, all consistent with a stall and vertical descent to impact. Accumulation of ice on the airplane in flight could have inhibited radio communications and created unusual airplane stall characteristics conducive to a stall/spin.",

The impact location was offset about 300 feet from the runway centerline and was about 2,400 feet down the 7,150 foot long runway. The airplane motion, trajectory, and impact angle were consistent with an aerodynamic stall. The wind was calm, the density altitude was about 1,340 feet, and the airplane was about 380 pounds below its maximum gross weight of 1,350 pounds. Several days after the accident, the pilot stated that he intentionally attempted to take off using partial engine power. The kit manufacturer's published guidance for the airplane contained conflicting information regarding the amount of power to be used for takeoff. The checklist section specified full power for takeoff. In contrast, the \"Flight Tips\" section instructed \"new\" pilots to \"restrict take-off power to about 75% of full power\" but did not provide any elaborating information. The guidance specified climb speeds between 45 and 65 mph and a clean power-off stall speed of 38 mph. The airplane was not equipped with either a stall warning or angle-of-attack indication system, and it was not required to be so equipped. Had the pilot recognized and correctly reacted to the impending stall, either by adding power, pushing the airplane nose down, or both, it is likely that the accident would not have occurred.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various entities, including, but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration and/or the operator and did not travel in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot stated he touched down on runway 02 with a right crosswind at about 20 degrees, full flaps, and with a crosswind correction. Upon touch down, the airplane began to veer to the left. The pilot applied full right rudder, the airplane turned back to the right, and required full right rudder for the airplane to remain straight. The pilot stated it felt like a left force was holding on to the airplane from behind, the force released, the airplane veered to the right with full right rudder applied, and the pilot lost directional control of the airplane. The airplane turned to the left off the runway, and started sliding sideways towards the right, the main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to a complete stop. The pilot stated he did not apply any brakes during the landing sequence. An e-mail received from a previous owner of the airplane before the accident stated, \"Nose wheel landings probably rank pretty high on the Sundowner \"stupid pilot tricks\" list. Also, be prepared for a pull to the left. Two different ATP's and I experienced a sudden pull to the left upon landing. It kind of feels like the left brake is stuck then brakes loose. We had the plane gone over by several mechanics and found nothing. Wind and runway condition was not a factor. It wasn't what I would call severe, but it will grab your attention.\" The pilot stated this event occurred before on March 27, 2007, when he was on a check ride. That event was not as severe as the accident flight, and the pilot attributed the event to his inexperience with the airplane. Examination of runway 02 by an FAA inspector revealed a 6 foot length tire thread skid (nose wheel) was present on the runway at the initial touchdown point approximately 9 feet to the left of the centerline. The tire tread skid extended beyond the initial point of initial contact in a faint tire scuff extending in a right arc approximately to 300 to 400 feet in length before exiting the right edge of the runway onto the grass. Another tire tread scuff (left main tire) was located adjacent to the nose tire tread scuff.  Both tire scuffs ran parallel to each other on pavement until the aircraft reached the right-hand edge of the runway. The aircraft departed runway 02 at the mid-point section, as made evident by nose and main tire tread marks disrupting gravel, grass, and a broken runway identification lamp. Examination of the airplane by the FAA revealed structural damage to the airframe. Examination of the lower strut wheel, brake and tire assemblies exhibited no apparent tread loss, the brake pad and wheel cylinders moved freely with no binding effect. Flight control surfaces were examined for continuity, there was no discrepancies noted. A review of maintenance documentation included research of airworthiness directives and applicable service bulletins that were factors relating to the accident. Service Bulletin No. 2014, Landing Gear-Removal of Free Play In Main Landing Gear issued in April 1984 had been accomplished on the airplane. Visual inspection of the left wing skin at the left gear attachment point revealed no evidence of failure or movement that would have attributed to the airplane departing runway 02 to the right side at mid-point length. Review of the airplane logbooks revealed the new brake discs were installed on November 28, 1998. All replaced components listed for use in the Beechcraft Illustrated Parts Catalog were visually verified by the FAA, and no anomalies were noted. Service Instruction No. 1168 pertaining to the installation of an improved grease seal and axle spacer was reviewed by the FAA. The accident airplane was not included in the serial numbers affected by the Service Instruction.",

After advising  Air Traffic Control (ATC) of his problem, ATC advised the pilot of the closest airport. During the descent, the pilot attempted to restart the engine without result. The propeller continued to windmill and no fuel pressure was indicated. He tried to start the engine again, and switch tanks, but  again the engine did not start. He  continued to glide the airplane to the airport which ATC had identified, but realized he would not make it, and decided to attempt an off airport landing. On approach to a field, he passed over some trees and a house, and selected \"full flaps\" for landing.
