No flight plan was filed for the local flight that departed about 1020. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.In a written statement, the pilot stated that he was making a soft field landing to a grass runway. The initial touchdown was on the main wheels with a nose up attitude. As the airplane decelerated, the pilot lowered the nose wheel. He said that immediately after the nose wheel touched down a \"significant\" nose shimmy was felt. The pilot thought the nose wheels' shimmy damper had failed, so he applied back pressure on the control wheel to minimize weight on the nose wheel. As the airplane continued to decelerate, the pilot again lowered the nose and a more substantial vibration occurred and he again raised the nose wheel as much as possible but eventually so much groundspeed had depleted that he could no longer hold the nose off the ground. When the nose wheel touched down on the ground for the last time, it completely failed and separated. The nose of the airplane then dropped to the ground and the airplane slid to a stop.",

The commercial pilot was fatally injured and the airplane was substantially damaged by impact forces. The airplane was registered to a private company and was operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Night, instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and no flight plan was filed. The local flight originated from Massey Ranch Airpark (X50), Edgewater, Florida, about 2030.Prior to the accident flight, the pilot, who was a Japanese citizen, contacted Flight Time Building LLC to purchase a block of flight time in a Cessna 152. According to the company's website, the company sells \"blocks\" of flight time to licensed pilots, with 50 hours being the minimum-sized block. The company dispatches an airplane to the pilot upon completion of a ground and flight \"checkout.\" According to the owner of Flight Time Building, on the day prior to the accident, the pilot flew a local flight with an instructor, followed by a cross country flight with a safety pilot, who was an instructor-in-training. The owner reported that the pilot was not \"signed off\" for solo flight after the flights on January 12. On the day of the accident, she flew an undetermined number of local, solo flights without the knowledge of Flight Time Building personnel. She possessed the keys to N757ZM since she had flown it on the previous day with the safety pilot. She refueled the airplane at her own expense and initiated the accident flight, which was a local, night flight in the traffic pattern at X50.An initial review of available radar data indicated that the pilot climbed to about 1,000 feet above mean sea level (msl) and was flying in the visual traffic traffic pattern at X50. The airplane was later observed in a climb to 1,700 feet msl and then a descent to 1,200 feet msl. During this time, the pilot set the airplane's transponder to 7700 (emergency) for about a minute. She began transmitting on guard (emergency) frequency and informed air traffic control (ATC) that she could not maintain visual flight rules (VFR) and could not see X50. Controllers provided assistance and directed her toward New Smyrna Beach Airport (EVB). The pilot informed ATC that she was at 600 feet and ATC directed her to climb. A short time later, radar and radio contact was lost and the airplane crashed onto New Smyrna Beach, in shallow water. Emergency responders arrived shortly thereafter in an attempt to provide assistance.Weather conditions at EVB included an overcast ceiling at 500 feet and 8 statute miles visibility.A preliminary review of pilot records recovered from the wreckage indicated that the pilot had logged about 416 hours total time as of January 7, 2015.

While parked, the pilot grabbed the flight manifest and placed it in his lap to make an entry.  While his head was down making the entry, the pilot had a sensation that the helicopter was \"rocking backwards\", and he grabbed both controls in an effort to \"level\" the helicopter.  The pilot lifted up on the collective and pushed forward on the cyclic. The tail boom separated from the fuselage and both sections of the helicopter fell off the platform and into the water.  Bell Helicopter Operations Safety Notice (OSN 206L-82-4), addressed tail boom skin compression wrinkles in all Bell model 206L/L-1/L-3 helicopter operations.  The Notice stated, \"Past 206 experience and flight tests...have revealed the tail boom and aft fuselage can be damaged if during an autorotation landing the main rotor RPM is allowed to decay below 70 percent RPM.  Applying collective pitch in excess of that required will in some instances result in excessive flapping of the main rotor during or after touch down.  This can cause a resonant response that can damage the tail boom and or aft of the fuselage.  Touch down rotor RPM above 70 percent RPM is preferred. Upon ground contact collective pitch should be reduced smoothly without delay while maintaining cyclic pitch near the center position.  Long ground runs with the collective up, or any tendency to float for a long distance prior to skid contact should be avoided.\"  When asked how this accident could have been prevented, the operator stated, \"Pilot should have remained more vigilant in monitoring control input and position.  More aggressive use of control friction would have minimized the possibility of this occurrence.\"  Examination of the wreckage revealed the tail boom separated forward of the horizontal stabilizer, consistent with an autorotation/low RPM failure.",

The airplane was loaded with lumber, building materials, groceries, personal luggage, plants, and other items for the lodge. Two witnesses said that just before it took off the airplane was loaded so heavily that its tires looked almost flat. The pilot reported to the NTSB that shortly after takeoff, at an estimated altitude of 150 feet, he raised the wing flaps from 30 degrees to 20 degrees, and the airplane began to sink. He said he started a slight right turn, but did not recall anything after that. According to multiple witnesses, the airplane was in an exaggerated nose-high, tail-low attitude, and struggling to climb as it approached the accident site. They related that the engine sounded loud, as if operating at full power, before it crashed into a parking lot and an unoccupied building. A postimpact fire, and cargo in the cabin, slowed rescuers from quickly removing the victims. Four of the occupants survived with serious burns and other injuries; the pilot\u2019s 4-year-old son was killed. The cargo remaining in the pod and cabin after the fire was weighed, and exemplar weights were used for the burned materials. Using conservative weights, which did not include some burned items like a large container of detergent, the airplane\u2019s total weight was estimated to be at least 658.2 pounds over its allowable gross weight, with a center of gravity significantly beyond the aft-most limit.  Both the aircraft and cargo pod manufacturer state maximum wing flap extension limits for takeoff; the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s pilot operating handbook notes 20 degrees should be the maximum, and the cargo pod manufacturer notes a maximum of 10 degrees.  Selecting more flap extension than recommended induces additional aerodynamic drag and adversely affects the airplane\u2019s acceleration and ability to climb. Federal air regulations require that children 2 years of age or older must be secured with a lap belt. Both of the child passengers, age 2 and 4 years, were not secured with a lap belt and were sitting on the two other passenger\u2019s laps. During the crash sequence, the right front seat passenger was unable to hold onto the 4 year old. The child was pinned by the unsecured cargo and died in the fire.Postaccident inspections of the airplane disclosed no preaccident mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The excessive overloading of the airplane, coupled with the aft center of gravity and the pilot\u2019s excessive use of flaps, placed the airplane well beyond its operating limitations, and made a successful takeoff highly improbable.",

Contributing to the severity of the injuries was the pilot\u2019s decision to allow two child passengers to sit on other passenger's laps without restraints, and his failure to properly secure the cargo in the cabin. Also contributing was the pilot's excessive extension of the wing flaps."

The owner\u2019s frustration likely distracted the mechanic and/or applied pressure for the mechanic to return the helicopter to service and revenue operations as soon as possible. \u000b\u000bOn-scene examination of the wreckage revealed that the pitch-link-to-swash-plate connection for one of the main rotor blades was missing. The pitch link and horn were found about 90 feet away. Metallurgical examination of the main rotor system revealed that the attaching hardware for the pitch-link-to-swash-plate connection was most likely not secured properly and separated after about 1 hour of flight following the maintenance. All other failures were consistent with overstress and no preexisting cracking was noted. No other anomalies with the helicopter structure, systems, or engine were found.",

The pilot-in-command allowed the airspeed to bleed off, and heard the stall warning. The airplane landed hard, and the nose undercarriage leg failed near the 2 inch bend radius. National Transportation Safety Board examination of the nose undercarriage leg revealed overstress separation. Transverse parallel crack-like features were noted on the forward surface of the leg below the fracture. The crack-like features were established to be local transverse regions of oxidation, many of which also contained a transverse crack in the surface. A meandering crack network was also noted in the aft side of the leg adjacent to the fracture. The cracks intersected the fracture at several locations, and oxidation accompanied the cracks. A polished cross-section intersecting the cracks in the forward and aft surfaces revealed at least eight cracks in the forward surface, and one crack in the aft surface. Close examination revealed heavy oxidation of the crack surfaces and adjacent material consistent with high temperature exposure after crack formation. Hardness testing in several locations of the nose undercarriage leg was within limits. No fatigue cracks were noted. The cracks of the nose undercarriage leg were caused due to improper forming of the bend by the vendor. In addition, the airplane manufacturer did not specify forming procedures for the vendor to comply with, nor did they perform any sample testing. The vendor was responsible for performing sample testing. A failure of a nose undercarriage leg owned by the airplane manufacturer occurred 15 days before the incident date. Testing of the failed nose undercarriage leg from the occurrence 15 days earlier revealed it had similar cracks as the incident case investigated by the Safety Board. Further investigation of the manufacturing process of the nose undercarriage legs by the airplane manufacturer revealed the 2-inch bend radius was torch heated then manually bent; the torch heating caused the cracking noted. As a result of the 2 failed nose undercarriage legs, the airplane manufacturer changed vendors, modified the nose undercarriage leg drawing, wrote a specific technical document for future vendors pertaining to the forming procedure, prepared Service Information Letter SIL-07-006, and inspected the nose undercarriage legs of 60 aircraft.

The airplane impacted trees on the right side of the runway. The pilot stated that before the attempted takeoff, he performed an engine run-up, during which he checked the operation of the carburetor heat; however, he did not leave the carburetor heat on at higher power settings for more than a few seconds. The pilot then taxied the airplane from the ramp area to the end of the runway for takeoff. The airplane was operating near or slightly over its maximum gross weight when the accident occurred, and the density altitude was calculated to be 3,347 feet. Postaccident examination revealed no preimpact malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The atmospheric conditions at the time of the accident were conducive for serious carburetor icing at glide power settings. Glide power settings yield a throttle angle similar to low power settings used for taxi operations; therefore, it is likely that the airplane\u2019s carburetor accumulated ice after engine run-up and during taxi, which was not detected by the pilot. This subsequent loss of power due to the carburetor ice accumulation resulted in a reduction in climb performance during takeoff and the resultant impact with trees on the side of the runway.",

The damage underneath the engine compartment near the box precluded a determination of whether the throttle linkage anomaly was present before impact.

The pilot, who was the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot. Day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and a flight plan had not been filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. The airplane had departed at an unknown time from Boerne Stage Field Airport (5C1), Boerne, Texas for a local flight.Several witness reported that the airplane was less than one mile west from 7TA8 and maneuvering about 800 feet above ground level when the engine sounds suddenly ceased. The airplane then entered a steep bank, began flying toward 7TA8, began descending and disappeared from their view. Other witnesses near the impact location reported seeing immediate fire after impact, and several witnesses ran to render aid to the pilot.Evidence at the scene showed the airplane was generally southbound when it impacted trees and terrain resulting in the partial separation of the right wing, engine and empennage. The airplane cabin came to rest upright about 100 feet from the edge of runway 22 at 7TA8, and about 89 feet south from the initial impact point.

Several witnesses observed the airplane depart from runway 01, and enter a \"nose-high\" climb attitude, until the airplane \"stalled,\" and descended straight-down.  One witness observed the airplane enter a stall, and then a continual right bank turn until it impacted trees.  Examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical deficiencies.  According to a pilot who flew with the instructor on the morning of the accident, one of the maneuvers which the instructor emphasized was an emergency landing after takeoff.  The pilot stated that they practiced this maneuver twice; once at an altitude of 900 feet, and once at 1,000 feet.  After the instructor pulled the power back at the desired altitude, the pilot would pitch the airplane for the \"best glide speed,\" or 80 knots, and bank the airplane \"real hard,\" into a 45-degree bank to return to the airport.  Examination of the Beechcraft Pilot Proficiency Program Flight Instructor's Teaching Guide stated that a turn back after power loss on takeoff, should be performed at a minimum altitude of 1,200 feet AGL, and 1.7 to 1.9 nm upwind from the start of a climb.  A review of FAA-H-8083-3, Airplane Flying Handbook, revealed: \"...If an actual engine failure should occur immediately after takeoff and before a safe maneuvering altitude is attained, it is usually inadvisable to attempt to turn back to the field from where the takeoff was made.

The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. The flight departed Goose Bay Airport (CYYR), Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, about 2115 EDT. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.The airplane was scheduled to be delivered by the pilot to a customer in Florida on the day of the accident. Preliminary radar and air traffic control (ATC) communication information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that, the airplane had departed Keflavik International Airport (BIKF), Keflavik, Iceland, about 0428 on August 26, and had made intermediate stops in Narsarsuaq, Greenland, and CYYR prior to departing on the accident flight. The approximate layover times of the two stops were each about 4 hours.As the airplane approached HUL, the pilot was instructed by ATC to maintain 3,500 feet until it reached the initial approach fix (IAP), and was cleared for the GPS approach to runway 05. The airplane descended to about 3,000 feet, crossed the IAP, reversed course, and tracked approximately along the final approach course of 049 degrees. The airplane passed the IAP about 2,500 feet, and continued its descent on the inbound course. The final radar target was at 1,500 feet about 2.5 miles prior to the landing runway.United States Customs and Border Patrol agents awaiting the airplane's arrival heard the airplane approach. In both a telephone interview and a written statement, one agent said the engine noise was smooth and continuous, until the sounds of impact were heard. He said the runway lights were never illuminated, and that it was foggy, \"misty,\" and that visibility was poor. According to the agent, \"It was so foggy you couldn't see 200 feet. It was wicked low.\"The 0153 recorded weather at HUL included wind from 230 degrees at 3 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, and an overcast ceiling at 400 feet. The temperature was 18 degrees C, the dew point was 17 degrees C, and the altimeter setting was 29.89 inches of mercury.At 0217, visibility reduced to 1-3/4 miles in fog, and the ceiling had lowered to 300 feet overcast.HUL was a non-towered airport which operated under class E airspace. The field elevation for the airport was 490 feet msl and the traffic pattern altitude was 1,035 feet msl. The airport was equipped with two asphalt runways. Runway 5/23 was 5,015 feet in length and 100-feet wide. The minimum descent altitude for the RNAV (GPS) RWY 5 approach was 960 feet msl. According to the procedure notes section, \"Procedure NA (not authorized) at night.\"About 0300, the police chief, a certificated pilot, tested the pilot-controlled runway lights and found them operational.The accident site was located in a wooded, rural area about 570 feet msl elevation, 1.25 miles from the approach end of runway 05. The wreckage path was approximately 360 feet long, and oriented about 014 degrees magnetic. The airplane struck trees and terrain and broke into several pieces before it came to rest submerged in a pond. Pieces of angularly-cut wood were found along the wreckage path.Prior to the arrival of investigators, the wreckage was recovered by local law enforcement and first responders and moved to HUL. During recovery, 15 gallons of fuel was recovered from the airplane.The wreckage was examined in a hangar on August 29, 2015.

The fractured hinge points from both ends of the flap remained attached to their respective mounts in the wing, and the fracture surfaces displayed features consistent with overload.The nose and right main landing gear were separated. The right main landing gear and the left and nose gear actuators were in the \"down\" position.The left wing was separated at its root, and the right wing was separated outboard of the engine nacelle. Each wing displayed concave dents oriented perpendicular to the spar. The radius of the dents was consistent with the size and shape of the fractured tree trunks at the accident site. Control cable continuity was established from the flight controls, thru several breaks, to the flight control surfaces.

A visual examination of the outer cylinder revealed a crack located approximately 26\u201d below the shock strut air valve. The outer cylinder had accomplished 3 ground air ground (GAG) cycles after completion of the December 2007 overhaul, and approximately 5836 cycles since the prior overhaul in 2004.The subject outer cylinder developed fatigue cracking in the wall which resulted in leakage of shock strut fluid. The fatigue cracking initiated at and near the ID surface, and propagated through the wall toward to OD until the leakage was detected and the cylinder was removed from service. Crack initiation was due to base metal damage which took the form of over tempered martensite and chemical attack/pitting. The over tempering reduced the strength of the material and caused reduction of shot peen induced residual compressive stresses. The combination of these factors results in the affected material having reduced resistance to fatigue cracking. The ID surface displayed base metal chemical attack which most likely developed during a plating operation on the sealing surface during the 2004 overhaul. The pitting features act as stress raisers, thereby serving as favorable crack initiation sites. The observed ID surface conditions appear to have been created during the overhaul in 2004, with the fatigue cracking occurring once the cylinder was returned to service. The cracking in the cylinder wall was not detected during the 2007 overhaul. Spectrochemical analysis and hardness testing confirmed that the cylinder was fabricated from the specified material, in the required heat treat condition. The cylinder exhibited slightly elevated bulk hydrogen levels, likely caused by the multiple plating and stripping operations during the 2004 overhaul. The condition may have provided a minor contribution to the propagation of the fatigue crack after initiation had occurred.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the MLG was due to cracking in the cylinder wall resulting from a fatigue mechanism which initiated at, and near the inner diameter (ID) surface, with propagation through the wall toward the outer diameter(OD) surface. Crack initiation was due to base metal damage which took the form of over tempered martensite (OTM) and chemical attack/pitting of the base metal."
