Consistent with local aerial application procedures, the Grumman pilot performed a high-altitude aerial survey of the field he intended to spray before he began his first spray run; he did not observe any other airplanes operating in that area. The Air Tractor pilot departed his private airstrip with the intention of applying herbicide to a rice crop located just south of the field being sprayed by the Grumman, in a north and south application pattern. Global positioning system data recovered from the Air Tractor showed its easterly departure from the private airstrip and flight toward the field intended for application, followed by a left turn and a northerly pass over the field. The pilot of the Grumman stated that he had completed about 50% of his first spray pass when the airplanes collided and that he did not see the Air Tractor before the collision.

After performing maneuvers for about 55 minutes, the pilot established the aircraft on a five-mile straight-in final approach for a full-stop landing. As he reduced the power below 2,000 rpm, he applied full carburetor heat. About one mile from the end of the runway, the engine started to run rough and then quit. During the attempted forced landing, the pilot, who does not hold a seaplane rating, flared too high, and while he was attempting to correct for the misjudged height,  one of the aircraft's wings impacted the water and sustained substantial damage. A post-accident inspection of the engine revealed that the carburetor heat warm air collection shroud was approximately half the size of the equivalent shroud used on Lycoming O-320 series engines mounted on certified aircraft. In addition is was discovered that the carburetor heat box butterfly valve fit loosely and did not have sealing material on its edge. The inspection also revealed that a number of coils of the support wire inside that scat tubing that directs hot air to the carburetor throat had collapsed. Using the FAA/DOT Carburetor Icing Probability Chart, it was determined that at the time of the accident, the aircraft was operating in ambient conditions that were conducive to moderate icing at cruise power and serious icing a glide power.",

As the aircraft floated down the runway, the speed decreased, and the pilot-in-command took control. Because he felt the aircraft was approaching a stall, he initiated a go-around. During the attempted go-around, the pilot-in-command found it necessary to keep both hands on the control wheel due to the fact that the aircraft had been trimmed to the full nose-up position during the landing flare. Even with both hands on the control wheel, the aircraft became very difficult to control. Although the co-pilot moved the throttles to maximum power and began retraction of the flaps, the pilot-in-command's remedial action had occurred too late to successfully execute the go-around. It was later discovered that during the operator's initial training, both crew members had been taught to apply full nose-up trim after crossing the runway threshold and reducing the power to idle. This action, which the operator eliminated from the landing sequence procedure after this accident, was inconsistent with the instructions in the Beech 99 Pilots Operating Manual. ",

The commercial pilot received minor injuries and one passenger, his wife, had serious injuries. The airplane was registered to TBM 850 536 LLC and was operated by pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Dekalb-Peachtree Airport (PDK), Atlanta, Georgia about 1240 and was destined for Pine Mountain, Georgia (PIM).During cruise flight at 6,000 feet above mean sea level (msl), the pilot reported to air traffic control (ATC) that he had a problem with the engine oil pressure. The controller provided vectors to Falcon Field (FFC), and later the pilot reported that he would not make the runway. Radar contact was subsequently lost and the pilot force landed the airplane. The airplane collided with trees and ground before coming to rest upright. There was no fire. The pilot and his wife exited the airplane and were transported to a local hospital for treatment.An inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) responded to the accident site and examined the wreckage. The fuselage and both wings exhibited structural damage and both wing fuel tanks were ruptured from impact forces. The landing gear and wing flaps were found in the retracted positions. There was evidence of fuel spillage throughout the wreckage path. The propeller and gearbox were broken free from the engine. The engine remained attached to the firewall. The airplane was equipped with a Garmin G1000 all-glass avionics suite. The unit held a Secure Digital (SD) card and investigators confirmed that the card recorded flight and systems data before and during the accident sequence. An initial examination of the engine revealed no external indications of blade damage, metallic debris on the chip detector plugs, or case rupture. The engine contained a sufficient supply of oil at the time of the accident and there were no indications of an oil or fuel leak.",

The pilot reported that, during the third lift, he felt vibration in the pedals that became violent, and the helicopter then began to rotate about its vertical axis. The air conditioning unit touched down on the roof as the helicopter was spinning. The pilot could not stop the helicopter\u2019s rotation, so he released the cable attached to the air conditioning unit and then maneuvered the helicopter away from the warehouse. He then increased forward speed, turned right to line up with a street, and conducted a roll-on landing.\u000b\u000bExamination of the helicopter revealed that the entire aft portion of one of the four tail rotor blades had separated just aft of the blade\u2019s spar where a bond line existed. Examination of the tail rotor blade revealed high-stress progressive crack growth features at the root end of the fracture, buckling deformation adjacent to the fracture, and bending deformation of the leading edge, all of which were consistent with the tail rotor blade fracturing due to dynamic instability in the tail rotor. The progressive crack growth features observed on the fracture surface were associated with relatively high stress and few cycles and likely occurred after the deformation associated with the buckling. In addition, all four tail rotor blades exhibited bending deformation, indicating that they all experienced loads that exceeded the allowable design loads, and the deformation pattern was consistent with an external input on the tail rotor assembly overloading all of the blades rather than a failure in the blade causing it to become unstable. The helicopter manufacturer confirmed that such damage can be caused by dynamic tail rotor instability and that such instability can be accompanied by tail rotor vibration, as was experienced during the accident flight. Although dynamic tail rotor instability rarely occurs, it has been known to occur on the accident helicopter make and model. To improve tail rotor stability, the helicopter manufacturer had introduced two modifications to the tail rotor system, and both of these modifications had been installed on the accident helicopter. Even with the modifications, dynamic tail instability can occur, and high values of left pedal, improper tail rotor cable tension (too high or too low), bottoming of the tail rotor control system spring, higher rotor speed, or relative wind from the right forward quadrant could increase susceptibility. However, a review of the helicopter\u2019s maintenance records did not reveal that any of the mechanical factors that could contribute to tail rotor instability existed, and wind was calm at the time of the accident. Additionally, after the damaged components were replaced, the helicopter was returned to service. The helicopter\u2019s flight manual also contained guidance stressing that pilots should immediately decrease the tail rotor pitch after encountering pedal vibration. If the pilot had recognized that the pedal vibration was indicative of tail rotor instability and immediately taken the proper corrective actions in accordance with this guidance, the accident might have been prevented.",

After the airplane was aligned along the show line, the airplane began a left roll to the inverted position and continued rolling until it was nearly inverted, but it stopped at an orientation of 156 degrees of rotation (24 degrees short of fully inverted flight). During the last seconds of the flight, the airplane's flightpath shifted from the east to the east-northeast, which directed it outside of the performance area and toward a Boeing 757 parked near aircraft hangars about 0.3 mile east-southeast of the accident site. About 1.3 seconds before the accident, the airplane began rolling right and then abruptly pitched toward the ground just before impact. During the final 2 seconds, the airplane's groundspeed reduced from about 106 to 84 knots. An examination of the airplane's wreckage did not reveal any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. An airshow crewmember reported hearing the wing walker telling the pilot before the airshow performance that he had previously flown too fast when she was walking along the wing to position herself. It is unknown if they further discussed the exact needs of the wing walker during the performance. However, it is likely that the pilot flew a more gradual maneuver to reduce the forces against the wing walker while she repositioned herself on the wing, which resulted in the entry into the maneuver not being set up as expected and created a tighter turn radius. On the videos, the airplane appeared to be flying slower than normal and did not pitch to the target nose-high parameter before beginning the left roll. The airplane developed a negative, or descending, vector as the airplane rolled toward the inverted position. The roll to the inverted position was stopped short of expected; because of the bank, the airplane was heading toward the crowd line. The airplane flew for a few seconds while partially inverted and well below the maneuver\u2019s 110-mph target airspeed. The airplane then began a right roll, although the planned maneuver typically used a left roll. It could not be determined if the pilot chose to discontinue the maneuver and exit with a reversed right turn to avoid a perceived collision hazard with the parked Boeing 757, to remain within the performance area, to not overfly the crowd, or a combination of these factors.

There was no evidence of a loss of fuel during the flight nor at the accident site, and the engine was operated following the accident. However, testing of the fuel injector servo revealed that its flow exceeded the maximum limit. The pilot stated he was using 11 gallons per hour for fuel usage planning.

The passenger was responsible for the granite during the flight. During takeoff, about 400 feet above the ground, a discrepancy with the left engine manifold pressure was noted, followed by a slight hesitation and mild backfire. Oil was seen leaking from the front nose section of the engine followed by an engine manifold pressure and rpm decrease. Smoke coming from the left engine was observed and reported by the airport controllers. The left engine's propeller failed to feather and the airplane wouldn't maintain altitude. The airplane impacted trees, vehicles, and the right wing struck a home before coming to a stop on the road. A fire ensued immediately after ground impact, all onboard exited without assistance. The fuselage from the cockpit to the tail section melted from the fire. The right wing was damaged by impact and fire, and the right engine remained intact on the wing. The left wing was separated 12 feet from the outboard and the engine separated from the firewall. Both engine's propellers were in the low pitch position. The flaps were full up and the landing gear were retracted. A weight and balance sheet was never furnished. The pieces of granite and limited cargo recovered from the wreckage weighed 3,140 lb.

Silver like metal flakes and particles were observed throughout the nose section, reduction gear section, main oil screen, and oil filter housing of the engine. An indication of propeller shaft housing movement was evident. Metal flakes with carbon build up were observed in the propeller shaft support and sleeve assembly.

The pilot reported that as he approached his destination he prepared for an instrument approach to the airport.  The pilot descended via the approach to an altitude of about 800 feet, at which point he was able to identify the runway environment and transition to a visual approach.  Throughout the approach, the pilot reported encountering moderate rain and restricted visibility.  The airplane's speed during the approach was about 120 knots, varying slightly with configuration changes required during descents and transitions to level flight.  During landing, the airplane touched down hard, about halfway down the 4,995-foot-long runway, and bounced twice.  The pilot reported that once established in the landing rollout, he applied full brakes and configured the propellers in full reverse thrust, attempting to stop before the end of the runway.  The pilot said that although the runway was absent of noticeable standing water, the moderate rain and wet conditions hindered braking effectiveness.  The airplane continued off the runway and impacted terrain resulting in the collapse of the nose gear.  The pilot was unable to remember the speed at which the airplane touched, but opined that it was about 100 knots, the normal touchdown speed for the airplane.

Both aircraft were operating on instrument flight plans in class A airspace under control of ZDC.  Required minimum separation between the aircraft was 5 miles and 1000 feet.  There was no damage reported to either aircraft and no injuries to passengers or crew.When interviewed, the R12 controller stated that she turned the GII east to avoid entering restricted airspace over Aberdeen, Maryland.  The heading issued to avoid the restricted area put the GII on a converging heading with the B737, with both aircraft descending to FL240.  Minimum separation occurred as both aircraft descended through FL279 and FL276, respectively, with 1.04nm lateral separation.Review of the R12 controller's training records showed numerous recurring writeups for not maintaining positive control of situations, not taking timely action when required, and use of poor control judgment.

The commercial pilot received minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal cross country flight, which departed from East Georgia Regional Airport (SBO), Swainsboro, Georgia about 1000 and was destined for Gwinnett County Airport-Briscoe Field (LZU), Lawrenceville, Georgia. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, he was on a cross country flight to Yellowstone National Park with multiple stops. On the morning of the accident he noted that the oil level was 1.5 quarts above the minimum. Prior to departure the pilot ran the engine up to 1700 rpm and observed no anomalies during the pre-takeoff check. After he departed SBO the pilot initiated a climb and flew a direct course to LZU. About 5 minutes after takeoff, the pilot leveled the airplane out at 2,500 feet mean sea level and configured the airplane for cruise flight, but the engine would not exceed 2100 rpm; 300 rpm below desired cruise power. He attempted to manipulate the mixture and activated the electric fuel pump, but the engine power remained steady at about 2100 rpm. The pilot elected to make a precautionary landing at a nearby airport, but moments after he diverted the engine oil temperature increased \"quickly\" and oil began to cover the windshield. The pilot subsequently attempted an emergency landing on a dirt road, but the left wingtip impacted the ground, the airplane cartwheeled, and came to rest in an inverted attitude, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and rudder.Postaccident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, with assistance from an airframe and powerplant mechanic, revealed that the forward torque shaft seal on the Lycoming O-360 engine was intact, but had separated forward of the crankcase. Examination of the cylinders revealed that portions of the No. 1 cylinder wall, compression rings and oil control ring had been burned through.  Review of maintenance records revealed that the airplane had been operated for about 8 hours since its most recent condition inspection, which was completed on April 20, 2015.

The airport manager stated that a front was approaching the airport and that it rained all night. According to the airport manager, the pilot returned to the airport the next morning, started the airplane, and taxied to the fuel pump. The right fuel cap was missing. He drained the fuel sump repeatedly because he found water in the right tank. The airport manager gave the pilot a fuel cap for the right tank so that he could depart. Witnesses reported seeing the airplane flying 50\u201360 feet above the ground with the engine sputtering and cutting in and out prior to the accident. Airplane impact damage was consistent with a steep nose-down attitude with about 80 degrees of left roll. Witnesses reported heavy cloud cover and limited visibility due to light-to-moderate fog.

(The previous accident occurred at the same airport in the same make and model of airplane but on the opposite runway. During that accident, the pilot delayed a decision to abort a long landing, and the airplane impacted trees beyond the end of the runway.)On the day of the accident, the pilot was observed attempting to land the airplane with a tailwind estimated by observers to be at least 10 knots. The airplane completed two traffic pattern circuits to low approaches that resulted in go-arounds. As the airplane approached the runway a third time, it appeared to be \"unusually fast.\" It commenced a landing flare past the runway identification numbers, floated, touched down nosewheel first, then porpoised several times. Just past the windsock, which was about 1,200 feet from the runway\u2019s departure end, engine power was applied, and the airplane's nose pitched up excessively high. The airplane then stalled at an estimated 200 to 300 feet above the runway and began a spin to the left, completing about 180 degrees of rotation before impacting the ground with power on.    Postflight examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

While en route, the flight crew encountered a forecast area of instrument meteorological conditions, whereupon they began a series of descents to lower altitudes in order to stay in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions beneath the clouds. During the last few minutes of their flight, the flight crew had descended to an altitude that was less than 1,300 feet above ground level (agl) over nearly level terrain.

The Aircraft Accident Report number is NTSB/AAR-06/04.On February 2, 2005, about 0718 eastern standard time, a Bombardier Challenger CL-600-1A11, N370V, ran off the departure end of runway 6 at Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey, at a ground speed of about 110 knots; through an airport perimeter fence; across a six-lane highway (where it struck a vehicle); and into a parking lot before impacting a building. The two pilots were seriously injured, as were two occupants in the vehicle. The cabin aide, eight passengers, and one person in the building received minor injuries. The airplane was destroyed by impact forces and postimpact fire. The accident flight was an on-demand passenger charter flight from TEB to Chicago Midway Airport, Chicago, Illinois. The flight was subject to the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 and operated by Platinum Jet Management, LLC (PJM), Fort Lauderdale, Florida, under the auspices of a charter management agreement with Darby Aviation (Darby), Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilots' failure to ensure the airplane was loaded within weight and balance limits and their attempt to takeoff with the center of gravity well forward of the forward takeoff limit, which prevented the airplane from rotating at the intended rotation speed.   Contributing to the accident were: 1) PJM's conduct of charter flights (using PJM pilots and airplanes) without proper Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification and its failure to ensure that all for-hire flights were conducted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 135 requirements; 2) Darby Aviation's failure to maintain operational control over 14 CFR Part 135 flights being conducted under its certificate by PJM, which resulted in an environment conducive to the development of systemic patterns of flight crew performance deficiencies like those observed in this accident; 3) the failure of the Birmingham, Alabama, FAA Flight Standards District Office to provide adequate surveillance and oversight of operations conducted under Darby's Part 135 certificate; and 4) the FAA's tacit approval of arrangements such as that between Darby and PJM."

The pilot recently purchased the airplane and had taken delivery of it on the day of the accident.  Examination of the engine revealed three of the crankshaft cluster gear bolts were fractured completely through.  The bolt fracture surface features were consistent with fatigue.  Additionally, the crankshaft gear had a hole where a crankshaft dowel had been installed following a design change in 1948 and was reflected in subsequent maintenance manuals.  The dowel is used as a reference in machining the crankshaft.  During the disassembly, the tappets fell out when the engine was overturned during the disassembly.  It was later noted that the tappets did not contain retaining hardware.  The interior of the crankcase halves contained a black colored residue when the oil was drained.  Logbook entries show that the engine was last overhauled on July 25, 1990, and accumulated a total time since overhaul of 257.5 hours.

The incident flight was the pilot's fourth flight of the day in the incident airplane. The first three flights were uneventful; however, the pilot noticed that the difference between the left and the right fuel quantities became increasingly larger during the second, third, and fourth flights when the left fuel quantity indicator was indicating a greater amount than the right. During the third flight, the pilot attempted to correct the fuel imbalance by supplying fuel to both engines from the left main fuel tank for a brief period, then returned the right fuel selector to the right tank position.Before takeoff of the incident flight, the pilot noted a 100-pound fuel imbalance; the left fuel quantity was indicating 300 pounds and the right fuel quantity was indicating 200 pounds. While climbing to 6,000 feet, he noticed a slight right-wing-heavy tendency but did not correct it at that time. The flight continued toward the destination airport and the fuel imbalance became greater as the flight progressed. Approximately halfway into the flight, for approximately 15 minutes, the pilot repositioned the left fuel selector to the right tank position; at that time the left fuel quantity gauge indicated 300 pounds and the right fuel quantity gauge indicated between 90 and 100 pounds. After 15 minutes he repositioned the left fuel selector to its respective tank position but was not able to position it into the detent and he failed to detect that the left fuel selector was not in the detent. The flight continued toward the destination airport with both engines being supplied fuel from the right main fuel tank. As the flight approached an area called Marco Island, the pilot became concerned because the left fuel quantity gauge was indicating 300 pounds and the right fuel quantity gauge indicated 50 pounds.He later stated that he thought the imbalance to be an indication issue. The flight continued toward the destination airport and the right engine began surging; the right fuel quantity indicator was indicating zero at that time while the left fuel quantity indicator was indicating approximately 300 pounds. He immediately moved the right fuel selector to the left tank position (crossfeed), which restored engine power; then the left engine began to surge, followed by the right engine. Unable to restore engine power in both engines, the pilot declared an emergency with air traffic control and executed a 180-degree turn towards Naples Municipal Airport. While descending he successfully feathered both propellers and landed uneventfully on runway 14 at the Naples Municipal Airport.Following recovery of the airplane only residual fuel was noted in the fuel lines and both engine compartments, which is consistent with total fuel starvation. An adequate quantity of fuel was noted in the left main fuel tank. Postincident testing revealed the left main fuel selector would not travel into the main tank detent upon selection in the cockpit because of inadequate lubrication of the fuel selector detents. Lubrication of the fuel selector detents was not being performed by the operator due to their misinterpretation of the airplane manufacturer maintenance manual. Additionally, the operator was using an incorrect lubricant on the fuel selector gearbox. Misinterpretation of the maintenance manual also occurred with six other operators who operate the Cessna 402C airplanes. Both engines operated normally after an adequate quantity of fuel was supplied to them.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to recognize that both engines were being supplied fuel only from the right main fuel tank, resulting in fuel starvation and a subsequent loss of engine power from both engines. Contributing to the incident were the pilot's inability to properly position the left fuel selector valve and the airplane operator's misinterpretation of the manufacturer's service recommendations to lubricate the fuel selector detents."

The second pilot reported that, as he initiated the final autorotation, the first pilot said \"hold on, hold on,\" and the second pilot thought he was again taking the controls and relinquished them to him.  As the helicopter continued the descent, the first pilot continued to say \"hold on, hold on,\" and the second pilot became worried because the ground approached rapidly and the low rpm horn had been on for several seconds.  When the second pilot realized they were going to crash and the first pilot wasn't doing anything to arrest the situation, he (the second pilot) took the controls and tried to flare and pulled full up collective to cushion the landing.

During the fourth landing, the student pilot \"did not flare enough, which resulted in a three-point landing\" and a subsequent \"porpoise\" of the airplane. The airplane bounced two or three times before he took control of the airplane and taxied clear of the runway. During the next landing, performed by the instructor, the nose landing gear collapsed. Postincident inspections conducted by the operator revealed that the nose landing gear strut weldment had cracked. The incident prompted the flight school to inspect their entire fleet of Cirrus SR20 airplanes, of which nine others exhibited cracking in the same location as the incident airplane. The airframe manufacturer subsequently issued a service bulletin mandating inspections of the nose landing gear strut for cracking. The service bulletin outlined the procedures to detect cracking, and specified corrective action that included replacement of the nose landing gear strut with a redesigned part if cracking over 0.19 inches was observed.",

During the turn, the airplane stalled, entered a spin, and impacted level terrain 1 nautical mile northeast of the departure end of runway 06.  The reported winds were 060 degrees at 15 knots.  According to the air traffic controller working the local control position, after completing several touch-and-go landings on runway 06, the instructor requested the first of two teardrop return to runway engine-out maneuvers.  During the first one, the airplane made a left teardrop 180-degree turn as it attempted to land on runway 24.  During the turn, the airplane appeared to lose a significant amount of altitude.  The controller stated that the airplane recovered prior to landing, and then executed a go-around to reenter the traffic pattern.  During the second attempt, the airplane again entered a teardrop turn to the left and then \"spin to the ground.\"  An examination of the wreckage revealed that the airplane impacted the terrain in a 70-degree nose down, left wing low attitude.

The next position further to the left is the \"off\" position, which is guarded by a spring-loaded mechanical stop.  In the wreckage the mechanical stop was found attached to a plastic cover over the fuel selector; however, the cover was broken from the selector handle assembly.

The builder/owner/pilot was uninjured, and the passenger received minor injuries. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no FAA flight plan was filed for the flight. According to the pilot, he kept the airplane at Nut Tree Airport (VCB),Vacaville, California, and the day prior to the accident flight, he flew to Reno/Stead airport (RTS) Reno, Nevada. The plan was to leave with another airplane for Oshkosh/EAA Airventure on July 26, with a fuel stop at Rock Springs, Wyoming, and an overnight stop at Mitchell, South Dakota. The two airplanes departed RTS as a flight of two, and there were two persons on each airplane. The second person on the accident airplane was not a pilot. The airplanes were climbing through 10,000 feet, about 25-30 miles northeast of RTS, and were being switched over to Reno Approach control when the \"engine died.\"The pilot described the engine failure as \"immediate,\" without any prior symptoms or a gradual onset. The propeller continued to windmill after the loss of power.The pilot manipulated various engine-related controls in an attempt to get the engine running again, but without success. He did not observe any indications that suggested the nature or cause of the engine failure.The pilot recognized that he would not be able to return to RTS, or to make it to any other airport. He spotted a road that was suitable for landing, and set up for a landing to the north. Shortly after touchdown, the airplane struck a northbound pick-up truck. The airplane \"spun around,\" the fuel tank was breached, and the left main landing gear collapsed.

A friend tried to dissuade them from flying because of the existing weather conditions, but was told they had to return home because, among other things, the children's school started the next day.  The friend then offered to drive home with them, and bring their rental car back.  The pilots declined, but assured him they would not fly if the weather was too bad.  At the airport, one of the pilots was seen checking the weather computer a number of times, and the group was noted as being 'pretty concerned about the weather.'  The airplane departed Elmira where the weather was reported at 1622 hours as 3,600 foot overcast with light rain, and climbed to about 8,500 feet into, or near instrument meteorological conditions.  The radar track showed the aircraft transitioning from a climbing right turn approximately 8,500 feet to a rapidly descending right turn.  An altitude loss of 1,600 feet in 12 seconds was recorded.  It was observed descending from a cloud layer, in a spin, with part of the left wing missing, just before impacting terrain. The pilot-owner was in the left front seat, and the other pilot was in the right front seat.  At the time of the accident, the airplane was near its maximum gross weight.

The pilot appeared to be rushed and departed in the airplane without performing a test flight. There was no record of the pilot receiving a weather briefing. The previous registered owner said that the airplane did not perform well in windy conditions due to its weight and design. The airplane departed and proceeded south while gradually ascending and leveling off about 9,500 feet mean sea level (msl). About 30 minutes after departure, the airplane turned to an easterly direction and began a 12-minute ascent to 14,800 feet msl. The airplane proceeded in a meandering southeasterly course and descended to 12,000 feet msl. About 30 minutes later, the airplane turned to a meandering easterly course and started another gradual descent to 7,000 feet msl. During the last 12 minutes of the flight, the altitude fluctuated between 5,800 and 7,300 feet msl. The final radar return was located 1 mile west of the accident location and showed the airplane 1.5 hours after departure, at 7,100 feet msl (5,170 feet above ground level).In the vicinity of the accident site, around the time of the accident, there was a westerly surface wind at 40 mph, gusting to 56 mph. The highest surface wind was reported north of the accident location with wind gusts up to 73 mph. At 9,500 feet msl, the wind was from 245 degrees at 28 knots, which resulted in a strong local vertical wind shear capable of producing moderate or greater turbulence in the layer. Several pilots operating in the area of the accident site reported encountering updrafts and downdrafts, from 1,500 to 2,500 feet per minute, and unusually strong low-level wind and turbulence.The airplane debris field was comprised of large heavy debris (engine and landing gear) near the location of the initial impact and lighter debris that was distributed downwind. Two items, a 2-foot-long section of vertical stabilizer and an 8-inch piece of rudder skin, were found 1,820 feet and 2,880 feet (respectively) downwind from the main debris scatter area, significantly farther from the main debris scatter area, which would indicate these two items were the first to depart the airplane. The overall debris pattern, and lack of damage to the wings is consistent with an in-flight breakup of the airplane. The rapid descent was probably initiated by the separation of about half of the vertical stabilizer as a result of severe turbulence while the airplane was near the location of the final radar return. The departure of a portion of the vertical stabilizer and pieces of the rudder would have resulted in the pilot\u2019s inability to control the airplane, followed by a rapid descent and subsequent in-flight breakup.",
