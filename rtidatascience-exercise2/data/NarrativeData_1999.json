During the initial climb, when the airplane was about 30 feet above the ground, the pilot noticed that the airplane had a slight bank to the right. He glanced at the airspeed indicator, and he believed it read either 70 or 90 mph. He attempted to correct for the right bank; however, the airplane did not respond. The instructor took over the flight controls and immediately added full left rudder and aileron. The airplane initially started to bank toward the left before it rolled into a steep right bank of about 60 degrees and impacted terrain. Witnesses reported that the airplane appeared to be climbing normally, and then it seemed to \u201csink\u201d and slow; the right wing lowered about 10 degrees before it dropped another 50 degrees, and subsequently impacted terrain.

The pilot reported that the single-engine airplane was in cruise flight when the engine lost power.  The pilot stated that he performed the emergency procedures including the wobble pump (manual fuel pump); however, the engine did not restart.  During the emergency descent to a road, the airplane struck trees, went to an inverted attitude, descended, and came to rest in a creek bed.  Maintenance records indicated that in April 1993, at the accumulated engine time of 4,110.0 hours, the engine was removed, overhauled and reinstalled.  On June 10, 1983, the wobble pump and fuel system were checked.  On November 4, 2001, the last annual inspection was performed at the accumulated airframe time of 8,117 hours, and 100 hour inspection performed at the accumulated engine time of 980.15 hours since major overhaul (TSMOH).  The airplane had accumulated 27.1 hours since the last annual inspection.   Flight control continuity was confirmed.  The auxiliary (wobble pump) handle was found in its stowed position.  When the engine driven fuel pump  was removed from the engine, the splines that engage the pump into the engine accessory section were intact; however, the pin that engages the drive coupling to the fuel pump drive shaft was found separated.  The  Thompson Ramo Woolridge Incorporated engine  drive fuel pump (model TF1900, S/N TF45071), and splined drive were examined by the NTSB metallurgist.  The housing for the fuel pump contains a rotor.  The hollow end of this rotor is exposed to the outside surface of the pump.  In the installed condition, the shaft end of the driver is partially inserted into the hollow shaft end of the rotor.  The shaft ends of both parts are attached to each other by a pin.  Visual examination of the pump pieces revealed that a pin was installed on the shaft end of the driver.  The ends of the pin were severely worn.  The length of the pin measured approximately 0.310 inch.  The spline gears showed no evidence of wear.  The mounting flange was disassembled from the pump housing to expose a portion of the hollow shaft end of the rotor.  The end of the shaft portion of the rotor has two sets of holes (a total of 4 holes).   The holes are spaced equally around the circumference of the shaft.   Continental Motors Corporation Service Bulletin (SB) ESD 182D indicated that the diameter of these holes should be measured in the circumferential and axial directions of the shaft.  If the diameter in the circumferential direction exceeds the diameter in the axial direction by more that 0.015 inch, the rotor must be replaced.  The rotor can be reused if either set of holes is worn less than 0.015 inch and the drive pin is installed in the unworn set of holes.  According to the SB, the rotor should be discarded and the pump should be overhauled if both sets of holes are worn beyond 0.015 inch.  The wall of the holes exhibited severe wear and was elongated in the circumferential direction.  The diameter of the worn hole in the circumferential direction measured 0.1500, 0.1430, 0.1510, and 0.1730 inch.  The diameter of the hole in the axial direction measured 0.1185, 0.1250, 0.1255, and 0.1225 inch, respectively.  The diameter of the holes in the circumferential direction exceed the 0.015 wear limits specified in the SB.   The inside diameter of the hollow end of the rotor measured approximately 0.313 inch, which was greater than the measured length of the worn pin (0.310 inch).  Utilizing an exemplary engine driven fuel pump, et al, the post-accident engine run sustained 2,450 rpm's and 28 inches manifold pressure.  The accident airplane fuel selector valve/auxiliary fuel pump (wobble pump) was plumbed into the test stand fuel system.  The exemplary engine driven fuel pump was removed from the engine, and the engine was started with the auxiliary fuel pump (wobble pump).  Utilizing the wobble pump, the engine sustained 2,450 rpm's and 28 inches of manifold pressure with only the wobble pump supplying fuel to the engine with the fuel selector valve (left and right) positions.  Examination and flow testing of the carburetor revealed that a four tube discharge nozzle was found installed in the carburetor.  According to the manufacturer\u2019s representative, the correct nozzle has six discharge tubes for the carburetor.  Auto gas was evident inside the carburetor.  During the flow test, no external leaks were noted.  Test points 1,3,4,5, and 11 were under the minimum limits, and all other test points were within specifications.  ",

Runway 36 is 2,980 feet in length with a 50-foot pavement width, and has a 3.5 percent uphill gradient  with steeper rising terrain to the north of the airport.  An airport warning sign states in red \"This R/W Closed for takeoff use R/W 18.\"  On the day of the accident, the pilot contacted the FAA Rancho Murieta Automated Flight Service Station at 0823.  The pilot questioned the briefer about the takeoff procedure and an \"X\" that was marked on the runway.   A discussion ensued, and the briefer told the pilot to takeoff on runway 36 (uphill), contrary to the intent of signage at the airport and FAA Airport/Facility Directory remarks.  According to the briefer, his source of information for questions relating to airport procedures and operations came from the FAA Airport/Facility Directory.  The entry for the airport in the FAA Airport/Facility Directory was examined.  The first portion of the entry stated:  \"Airport closed to touch and go; go arounds; takeoff from runway 36 and landings on runway 18.\"  Toward the end of the entry following some intervening information another note stated:  \"Land runway 36 takeoff runway 18 due to steep 3.5 percent uphill airport gradient and steeper rising terrain to the north.\"  The maximum gross weight of the airplane is 3,850 pounds.  Based on known and estimated weights, the weight of the airplane at the time of the accident was about 3,939.0 pounds, or 89 pounds above the maximum takeoff weight.  According to the POH and best available information, the airplane would have required 3,750 feet of level, paved, and dry runway surface for takeoff with zero flaps to clear a 50-foot obstacle at the end.  Witnesses at the airport estimated that the temperatures were in the mid 90's to over 100 degrees, and the wind was out of the south.  Based on information provided by the witnesses, the density altitude was estimated between 4,000 and 4,800 feet mean sea level (msl). ",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's selection of the wrong runway, which resulted in an attempted takeoff uphill in a prevailing tailwind toward rising terrain and high obstacles.  Also causal was the pilot's loading of the airplane above maximum gross weight and his failure to properly interpret the aircraft performance charts, which showed the airplane required more runway and distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle than existed for the ambient conditions.  Factors in the accident were the high density altitude and the confusing and contradictory information in the Airport Facility Directory."

The pilot stated that his preflight inspection before the accident flight did not reveal any mechanical issues with the airplane, including loose jam nuts or any other aileron anomalies. However, the pilot reported that his aviation mechanic had to retighten the jam nut for the center aileron hinge rod-end after it had been found loose on several occasions before the accident flight.A postaccident examination revealed that the center aileron hinge had failed in the shank region of the rod end due to reverse bending fatigue. No material issues were identified with the center aileron rod end, which met the part specifications. A design analysis confirmed that the aileron rod ends were adequate for the limit loads on the structure but were inadequate for fatigue tolerance. The stress levels in the rod end shank were at or above the endurance limit for the specified rod end material, regardless of a loose or tight jam nut. However, a loose jam nut further increased the stress in the rod end about 28 percent and would have reduced the cycles to a fatigue failure. Following the accident, the airplane manufacturer redesigned the aileron bracket assemblies by increasing the diameter of the rod end shank and reducing the moment arm between the bearing and the aileron bracket.

As the tail lost lift and the tail wheel made contact with the runway, the airplane veered left of the centerline. At 1900 feet, the airplane crossed from the south side of the runway over the centerline to the north side of the runway. The airplane veered again to the left and departed the runway on the south side about 2,000 feet from the approach end. The airplane came to rest perpendicular to the runway 2,144 feet from the approach end. Examination of the accident on-scene found that the airplane departed the runway edge and proceeded down a fifteen-foot embankment and made contact with several large rocks, separating both main landing gear. The airplane continued to rotate counter clockwise about 45-degrees and came to rest near trees. Winds at the time of the accident were 100-degrees gusting to 15 knots. Examination of the auto-locking feature for the tail-wheel found that the mechanism operated properly. Tail wheel skid marks on the runway were clearly visible throughout the length of the loss-of-control sequence. Tail wheel scuff marks were in line with the main landing gear and exhibited side-load scuffing consistent with the tail wheel being in the forward, locked position.

The commercial pilot reported he was in cruise flight at 1,000 feet above the ground when the engine lost power.  The pilot reported the loss of power was \"in a manner indicative of fuel starvation.\"  The pilot switched fuel tanks from the auxiliary fuel tank to the right main fuel tank and attempted an engine restart with the wobble pump.  The pilot obtained an engine surge, but no power.  He switched to the left main fuel tank and utilized the wobble pump again, to no avail.  The pilot then set up for the forced landing in desert terrain.  Post-accident examination of the aircraft revealed there was no fuel present in the auxiliary fuel tank, while the left and right main fuel tanks had 10 and 15 gallons of fuel, respectively.  No fuel was present in the gascolator, the carburetor, and any of the fuel lines forward of the firewall.  The aircraft's operation manual indicates that the auxiliary fuel tank should not be completely emptied in flight because it will result in air being pumped into the fuel line.",

The pilot executed a running landing to a nearby landing zone. During the landing, the helicopter encountered rough terrain, which resulted in deformation of the tail boom skin. Postaccident examination of the No. 2 engine revealed that a turbine blade had separated from the 3rd stage turbine wheel. Metallurgical examination of the blade determined that it had failed as a result of high-cycle fatigue probably due to an intermittent vibratory state. The engine manufacturer issued a service bulletin in 2006 and a revised bulletin in 2009 that systematically removed the 3rd stage turbine wheel that was susceptible to this failure mode from the fleet of Model 250 Series II engines. The service bulletin required that the 3rd stage turbine wheel must be replaced at overhaul or if the helicopter experienced an one-engine inoperable (OEI) condition. The turbine wheel had not been replaced, and it could not be determined if the helicopter had experienced an OEI condition.",

The ATC controller issued the pilot the weather (wind 120 degrees at 9 knots, visibility 10, clouds 25,000 scattered, temperature 20 degrees Celsius, dew point 19 degrees Celsius, and the altimeter 30.02 inches Mercury) at the nearest airport (approximately 15 nautical miles from the destination airport) and told the pilot that fog was reported in the area. The pilot requested and was cleared for the non-precision approach VORDME 14 at the destination airport.  Radar contact was lost with the aircraft at an altitude of 1,901 feet msl.  Subsequently, the pilot transmitted in part  \"approach... can't find the airport.\"  The controller instructed the pilot to execute the published missed approach instructions and asked the pilot for his next request.  The pilot transmitted in part: \"I've got it, I've got the strobe under me now sir.\"  The controller requested if the airplane was landing and the pilot transmitted \"affirmative sir I got the strobe.\"  The controller asked the pilot if he was canceling IFR, and the pilot transmitted \"no sir just a minute stay with me please sir.\"  There were no further communications with the pilot.  Witnesses near the airport reported hearing the airplane flying low, a loud boom, the sound of an explosion and fire.

            "narrative": ": NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this public aircraft accident report.As the NOTAR (No Tail Rotor) helicopter entered a normal descent on downwind for landing, control was lost and the helicopter entered an uncontrollable left spin as it descended to ground impact.  A stress corrosion fracture and separation of a fitting in the anti-torque system thruster control cable resulted in a fixed jet thruster nozzle setting and precluded the pilot from controlling the left yawing rotation.  RFM (Rotorcraft Flight Manual) procedures provided inadequate information for the pilot to understand the anti-torque system and apply proper corrective action to minimize the effects of the stuck thruster condition.  FAA and the manufacturer failed to recognize the implications and significance of a known stress corrosion cracking problem and take appropriate preventative measures in a timely manner.  Maintenance diagnostic actions were inadequate to correctly diagnose a yaw control system anomaly reported by the pilot 2 days prior to this flight.  The pilot's negative transfer of anti-torque failure procedures from a conventionally designed helicopter precipitated improper pilot control input in response to the fixed jet thruster nozzle condition.  A compilation of ground witness observations revealed that the helicopter began a yaw to the right from normal straight flight, then suddenly reversed direction and entered into a rapid left rotation as it descended to the ground.  Radar data showed the flight was uneventful until 11 seconds after completing a left turn to a downwind heading and beginning a normal descent for landing.  At this point, a spike was observed in the Mode C altitude readout, indicating that a large sideslip angle had occurred inducing a static system pressure anomaly, and, probably represents the ground witness observed initial yaw to the right.  The helicopter's airspeed profile until the onset of the right yaw was normal and within the expected cruise range for this point in the flight.  The altitude spike was also coincident with the pilot's first mayday call to the tower controller and strongly indicates that the emergency situation had evolved to a state which alarmed the pilot.  The helicopter's NOTAR anti-torque yaw control system utilizes a transmission driven fan with variable pitch blades to supply air to circulation control slots on the tail boom and a pilot controlled directional jet thruster nozzle.  The yaw control system has sufficient authority to induce large and prolonged sideslip angles at cruise flight airspeeds.  Pilot control of the jet thruster nozzle uses torque tubes from the cockpit anti-torque pedals to a splitter assembly at Fuselage Station (FS)113.  Torque tubes transmit pedal movement from the splitter to the fan blade pitch change mechanism to increase airflow in the tail boom as the pedals are displaced from neutral in either direction.  A three-part cable transmits motion from the FS113 splitter to the jet thruster nozzle to control its directional orientation.  The forward and center cables have a Teflon-coated inner steel control wire which slides back and forth in an outer sleeve.  At the FS113 splitter, a telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling retained by a swaged lip allows for angular displacement of the cable rod end as the splitter assembly rotates.  During postaccident examination of the NOTAR jet thruster control cable, a fracture and separation was found in the cable's telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling swaged lip, which was subsequently identified as caused by stress corrosion.  With the retaining lip missing, the ball swivel coupling is not restrained and will allow the inner wire to slide out of the outer sleeve.  As the cable moves out of the sleeve (left cockpit control pedal movement), the exposed cable will bow and not transmit any subsequent right pedal movement back to the jet thruster nozzle to counter left yaw.  Metallurgical examination found that the fitting's failure and separation preceded this flight by some length of time.  The Teflon coating of the inner cable was severely abraded, indicating that it had been operating out of its sleeve over the complete range of fore and aft (left to right cockpit pedal) cable movement for some length of time greater than just this flight.  The inner cable roughness on the abraded area was in proximity to the sharp edges of the cracked telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling fitting, and could easily catch or hang up.  Two days before the accident, this pilot experienced a yaw control anomaly with this helicopter and he made a precautionary landing at another airport.  Over a 2-day period, maintenance technician(s) examined the thruster control system at the precautionary landing location and could not determine the reason for the discrepancy.  During the detailed examination of the cable runs and control freedom checks, the maintenance technician did not remove the access panel over the FS113 splitter assembly (the location of the failed telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling) to fully examine the thruster control cable run.  The pilot and the maintenance technician incorrectly attributed the yaw control anomaly to a YSAS (Yaw Stability Augmentation System) failure, and a joint decision was made between the pilot and the maintenance technician to disable the YSAS and ferry the helicopter with the unresolved yaw control discrepancy to the maintenance base for further diagnostic work.  At zero or very small sideslip conditions, the nature of the vertical stabilizer design produces a tension load in the thruster control cable, which would pull a failed forward cable telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling fitting together; at larger right sideslip angles (left yaw), the tension load in the thruster cable decreases and eventually becomes a compressive load, which would tend to assist the movement of the inner cable out of the sleeve.  Movement of the anti-torque control pedals changes the fan blade pitch to produce more airflow to the circulation control slots and the anti-torque thruster nozzle.  As the pedals are displaced from center toward either extreme of travel, the airflow increases proportionally.  The RFM procedures for a stuck thruster condition are incomplete and do not contain procedures to minimize airflow to the thruster nozzle (i.e., neutralize the pedal position at the onset of a stuck thruster condition).  The pilot was concurrently flying the HH-60 helicopter for the California Air National Guard.  The emergency procedures for an anti-torque failure in the MD500N are diametrically opposed to those for the HH-60.  The specific immediate pilot action items for an anti-torque drive system failure in the HH-60 are actions that are expressly prohibited in the MD500N.   MDHI and Cablecraft, the cables manufacturer, had been aware of stress corrosion cracking in other coupling fittings in the cable run for 2 years.  They failed to expeditiously identify the stress corrosion cracking problem in the telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling fitting, and failed to change the component specifications in a timely way to prevent the failure and separation of the fitting.  The FAA concurred with MDHI assessment that the stress corrosion cracking in various fittings in the cable was not a safety of flight issue and the company was given until January 2000 to solve the cracking problem.  The FAA also concurred with MDHI engineers that the stress corrosion cracking in the thruster cable fittings was considered a minor service difficulty and was not determined to be an unsafe condition, which would warrant the issuance of an airworthiness action.  This indicates that MDHI and the supervising FAA Aircraft Certification Office inadequately assessed the significance of the stress corrosion problem and the potential consequences of a failure of the telescoping sleeve ball swivel joint.  MDHI contends that the position of the jet thruster nozzle as it was found during the wreckage examination indicated right anti-torque pedal control was available during the loss of control and descent to impact.  However, witness marks and color transfers establish that the blue main rotor blade flexed downward during the ground impact sequence, severing the tail boom. The center thruster cable was impacted by the blue main rotor blade and forcibly separated at the aft bell cranks and the quick disconnect fitting.  The main rotor blade impact with the thruster cable placed a tension load on the cable and would have pulled the telescoping sleeve ball swivel coupling joint back into the outer sleeve, where it was found during the wreckage examination.  A sudden tension load on the cable run would move the jet thruster nozzle can, which has no fixed physical limit stops and can rotate 360 degrees on it's mounting.  The post impact position of the jet thruster nozzle can was in an over-travel condition induced by the sudden and violent tension load in the cable caused by the rotor blade contact.  The post impact position of the nozzle was not considered as a reliable indication of nozzle position before impact.  Sound spectrum analysis shows the main rotor transmission was operating at 100 percent until after the Mode C altitude readout spike, and then it rapidly decayed during the descent to ground impact.  The twist grip throttle control and the fuel control indices were found at idle.  MDHI contends that this indicates the pilot was attempting to deal with a high side governor failure and subsequent over speed of the main rotor, and his resultant actions exacerbated the effects of the stuck thruster condition and caused the ultimate loss of control.  Postaccident testing and analytical modeling established that the governor, while exhibiting the wear and tear of a high time component, had an operating capability variance from normal of less than 1 percent and would have had an insignificant effect in main rotor operation.  The throttle and fuel control indices position indicates a pilot input in an attempt to arrest the uncontrollable spin.  Additionally, anatomical injuries to the right seat passenger and corresponding helicopter interior damage indicates that a violent left rotation spin of the helicopter occurred very early in the sequence and continued until ground impact; the rotation rate was at or near 1 revolution per second.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's in-flight loss of control due to the failure and separation of the forward thruster control cable telescoping sleeve ball swivel fitting, which resulted in a stuck thruster and the entry into an uncontrollable yaw/spin.  Also causal was the mechanics improper maintenance actions during diagnostics to determine the cause of a yaw control anomaly in that he failed to remove an access panel over the FS113 splitter to fully and completely examine the thruster control cable.  Factors in the accident were: (1) the incomplete emergency procedures/system explanations in the RFM for a stuck thruster condition;  (2) the pilot's negative transfer of emergency procedures from the HH-60, which likely induced him to make incorrect inputs to throttle, collective, and the anti-torque controls during the onset of the stuck thruster condition; and (3) MDHI and the cable manufacturer's failure to expeditiously diagnose and correct the stress corrosion cracking problem in the forward thruster cable ball swivel fitting.

At 2:56 am, runway 19R was closed for surveying and the runway lights were off.  ATIS information G advertised the closure and an X was placed on the tower's ASDE display to confirm the closure.  The closure was also displayed on the IDS 5 status display although not included in the Tower's Daily Log.  A survey crew was working at the south end of runway 19R.  There were weighted cones about 2000 feet from the south end of the runway.  The crew got in their truck and started driving northbound on runway 19R to get something.  As they approached the north end of the runway, the controller cleared the N66NJ into position and hold (prohibited with only one controller in the tower), then cleared it for takeoff.  The survey crew in the truck heard the clearance and advised the controller that they were still on the runway.  Instead of canceling the takeoff clearance, the tower controller asked the survey crew if they could clear the runway.

Witnesses on the ground said the helicopter was heading northwest when it \"started spinning\" and \"the nose went straight down.\" An examination of the wreckage revealed no anomalies.  The pilot had 148.9 total hours in helicopters, all within the 84 days preceding of the accident.  The winds reported at Phillip Billard Airport, 8 miles east of the accident site were 180 degrees at 12 knots.  Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular (AC) 90-95 states that loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) is a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic which can result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate which does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, can result in a loss of aircraft control.  Helicopters are subjected to constantly changing wind directions and velocity.  The required tail rotor thrust ... is modified by the effects of the wind.  If an uncommanded yaw occurs in flight, it may be because the wind reduced the tail rotor effective thrust. \"There is greater susceptibility for LTE in right turns.  This is especially true during flight at low airspeed since the pilot may not be able to stop rotation.\"  The loss of translational lift is a flight characteristic that can create an LTE conducive environment capable of  adversely affecting aircraft controllability.  The loss of translational lift results in increased power demand and additional anti-torque requirements.  When operating at or near maximum power, this increased power demand could result in a decrease in rotor rpm. ",

Using the reported temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, he determined the takeoff roll would be 1,500 feet by referencing the airplane's Pilot Operating Handbook (POH). The departure runway was annotated in the airport directory as being 2,009 feet long and in poor condition. The pilot planned to use the grass overrun area of the runway to extend the departure roll by about 400 feet. The pilot completed an engine run-up and noted no anomalies. He extended the flaps to 10 degrees for a short-field takeoff and taxied into position for takeoff. With the brakes set, he increased the throttle to full power and leaned the mixture in an effort to gain better performance. When the tachometer indicated 2,400 rpm, he released the brakes and started the takeoff roll. Initial acceleration was slow, but once the airplane reached the paved runway the airplane accelerated normally. The airplane lifted off the runway and remained in ground effect. The pilot turned to the left to avoid trees, flew under power lines, and made a forced landing to a field where the airplane collided with a fence.The airport manager, who observed the takeoff, stated that the pilot forced the airplane into the air, and it wallowed left to right barely flying. He opined that the airplane never flew out of ground effect.  According to the POH, \"...normal and short field takeoffs are performed with flaps up. Use of 10 degree flaps is reserved for takeoff from soft or rough fields. Use of 10 degree flaps allows safe use of approximately 5 KIAS lower takeoff speeds than with flaps up. The lower speeds result in shortening takeoff distances up to approximately 10 percent. However, this advantage is lost if flaps up speeds are used, or in high altitude takeoffs at maximum weight where climb performance would be marginal with 10 degree flaps. Therefore, use of 10 degree flaps is not recommended for takeoff over an obstacle at high altitude in hot weather...\" ",

He made one high pass around the summit and assessed the wind as light and variable. He made a right circling approach and slowed from 60 knots to 40 knots. The airspeed suddenly decreased to 20 knots and the helicopter yawed 90 degrees to the right. He temporarily stabilized the situation, but then the helicopter went into a violent and uncontrollable right spin. It spun down vertically until it collided with terrain, rolled onto its right side, and slid about 75 yards before coming to a stop facing uphill. One of the passengers held a rotorcraft/helicopter pilot certificate. He indicated that on the first landing attempt the pilot appeared to be running out of left pedal. The second attempt was at a different angle to the landing zone, but once again the pilot seemed to run out of left pedal and the helicopter began to spin. The pilot could not recover during the attempt and the helicopter made three turns before colliding with the terrain. The Rotorcraft Flying Handbook refers to unanticipated yaw that does not subside on its own as a loss of tail rotor effectiveness. It notes that, if not corrected, this can lead to a loss of control. It may occur in all single-rotor helicopters at airspeeds less than 30 knots.

Witnesses described the accident airplane\u2019s approach as fast and stated that the airplane never touched down. The accident airplane\u2019s engines then rapidly accelerated to full power before the airplane pitched up into a steep climb, banked left, rolled inverted, and struck the ground in a nearly vertical nose-down attitude, about 3,600 feet down the 5,599-foot-long runway. Throughout the morning of the accident, glider operations were being conducted on an intersecting runway. As the accident airplane floated down the runway, witnesses observed a tow plane accelerating down the intersecting runway with a glider in tow; The tow plane pilot then announced over the CTAF, \u201cabort abort abort.\u201d The glider was then released from the tow plane and landed undamaged on the runway prior to the intersection of the two runways, while the tow plane crossed over the intersecting runway before taxiing back to the ramp.Examination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies. According to witnesses on the airport, neither the glider nor tow plane appeared to be in immediate conflict with the accident airplane just before the accident; they stated that the accident pilot could have safely continued the landing. Additionally, the three pilots onboard the accident airplane had flown into the airport earlier in the day and were aware of the glider operations being conducted on the other runway. However, the accident pilot\u2019s observed reaction, as evidenced by the sudden application of full engine power followed by the airplane\u2019s abrupt increase in both pitch attitude and bank angle, suggest that he may have been surprised by the appearance of the glider and tow plane in his field of vision and perceived an imminent collision.The FAA airport manual contained advisories for glider operations at the accident airport. Examination of the airport rules and regulations, published on the airport website, revealed that a local notice to airmen (NOTAM) was required to be filed prior to the conduct of glider operations. Additionally, a \u201cspotter\u201d was prescribed to be used during glider operations, positioned in a location from which the entire length of the intersecting runway could be viewed, in order to avoid conflicts with other aircraft. According to the airport rules and regulations, the tow plane and glider were prohibited from taking off without approval from the spotter. On the day of the accident, no NOTAM had been filed regarding the day\u2019s glider operations, nor was a spotter being used. Interviews with the glider operator revealed a widespread lack of knowledge regarding these published rules. Furthermore, while airport management was aware of the rules with regard to glider operations, there was no method in place to ensure compliance with the published risk management practices.",

One witness observed the airplane for the entire event and stated that the run-up of the engines sounded normal. During the takeoff roll, the acceleration of the airplane appeared a little slower but the engines continued to sound normal. Directional control was maintained, and at midfield, the airplane had still not rotated. As the airplane continued down the 5,132-foot-long runway, it did not appear to be accelerating, and, about 100 yards from the end of the runway, it appeared that it was not going to stop. The airplane maintained contact with the runway and turned slightly right before it overran the end of the runway. The airplane was subsequently destroyed by impact forces and a postaccident fire. The wreckage was located at the bottom of a deep gully off the end of the runway. Postaccident examination of the area at the end of the runway revealed two distinct tire tracks, both of which crossed the asphalt and dirt overrun of 175 feet. A review of the airplane\u2019s weight and balance and performance data revealed that it was within its maximum gross takeoff weight and center of gravity limits. At the time of the accident, the density altitude was calculated to be 7,100 feet; the airport\u2019s elevation is 4,830 feet.

It is unknown whether the pilot completed performance calculations accounting for the density altitude.All flight control components were accounted for at the accident site. Although three witnesses indicated that the engines did not sound right at some point during the runup or takeoff, examination of the engine and airframe revealed no evidence of any preexisting mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Propeller signatures were consistent with rotational forces being applied at the time of impact.

As directed, the pilot subsequently  contacted the next sector departure controller, who instructed him to climb to 8,000 feet. The pilot stated that he would climb the airplane after clearing a cloud and reiterated that the airplane was having \u201cinstrument problems.\u201d The controller told the pilot to advise when he could climb the airplane. About 30 seconds later, the pilot told the controller that he was climbing the airplane to 8,000 feet, and, shortly thereafter, the controller cleared the airplane to 11,000 feet, which the pilot acknowledged. Per instruction, the pilot later contacted a center controller, who advised him of moderate-to-heavy precipitation along his (northbound) route for the next 10 miles and told him that he could deviate either left or right and, when able, proceed direct to an intersection near his destination. The pilot acknowledged the direct-to-intersection instruction, and the controller told the pilot to climb the airplane to 13,000 feet, which the pilot acknowledged. The pilot did not advise the center controller about the instrument problems. \u000b\u000bThe airplane subsequently began turning east, eventually completing about an 80-degree turn toward heavier precipitation, and the controller told the pilot to climb to 15,000 feet, but the pilot did not respond. After two more queries, the pilot stated that he was trying to maintain \u201cVFR\u201d and that \u201cI have an instrument failure here.\u201d The controller then stated that he was showing the airplane turning east, which \u201clooks like a very bad idea.\u201d He subsequently advised the pilot to turn to the west but received no further transmissions from the airplane. \u000b\u000bRadar indicated that, while the airplane was turning east, it climbed to 9,500 feet but that, during the next 24 seconds, it descended to 7,500 feet and, within the following 5 seconds, it descended to just above ground level (the ground-based radar altitude readout was 0 feet). The pilot recovered the airplane and climbed it northeast-bound to 1,500 feet during the next 20 seconds. It then likely stalled and descended northwest-bound into shallow waters of a wildlife refuge. Weather radar returns indicated that the airplane\u2019s first descent occurred in an area of moderate-to-heavy rain but that the second descent occurred in light rain. The ceiling at the nearest recording airport, located about 20 nautical miles from the accident site, was 1,500 feet, indicating that the pilot likely climbed the airplane back into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC)before finally losing control.\u000b\u000bThe investigation could not determine the extent to which the pilot had planned the flight. Although a flight plan was on file, the pilot did not receive a formal weather briefing but could have self-briefed via alternative means. The investigation also could not determine when the pilot first lost situational awareness, although the excessive turn to the east toward heavier precipitation raises the possibility that the turn likely wasn\u2019t intentional and that the pilot had already lost situational awareness. \u000b\u000bEarlier in the flight, when the pilot reported an instrument problem, the two departure controllers coordinated between their sectors in accordance with air traffic control procedures, allowing him to remain low and out of IMC. Although the second controller told the pilot to advise when he was able to climb, the pilot commenced a climb without further comment. The controller was likely under the impression that the instrument problem had been corrected; therefore, he communicated no information about a potential instrument problem to the center controller. The center controller then complied with the level of service required by advising the pilot of the weather conditions ahead and by approving deviations. The extent and nature of the deviation was up to the pilot with controller assistance upon pilot request. The pilot did not request further weather information or assistance with deviations and only told the center controller that the airplane was having an instrument problem after the controller pointed out that the airplane was heading into worsening weather. \u000b\u000bDue to impact forces, only minimal autopsy results could be determined. Federal Aviation Administration medical records indicated that the 16,560-hour former military pilot did not have any significant health issues, and the pilot\u2019s wife was unaware of any preexisting significant medical conditions. The wreckage was extremely fractured, which precluded thorough examination. However, evidence indicated that all flight control surfaces were accounted for at the accident scene and that the engines were under power at the time of impact.  \u000bThe airplane was equipped with redundant pilot and copilot flight instruments, redundant instrument air sources, onboard weather radar, and a storm scope. The pilot did not advise any of the air traffic controllers about the extent or type of instrument problem, and the investigation could not determine which instrument(s) might have failed or how redundant systems could have been failed at the same time. Although the pilot stated on several occasions that the airplane was having instrument problems, he opted to continue flight into IMC. By doing so, he eventually lost situational awareness and then control of airplane but regained both when he acquired visual ground contact. Then, for unknown reasons, he climbed the airplane back into IMC where he again lost situational awareness and airplane control but was then unable to regain them before the airplane impacted the water.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s loss of situational awareness, which resulted in an inadvertent aerodynamic stall/spin after he climbed the airplane back into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s improper decision to continue flight into IMC with malfunctioning flight instrument(s). "

He said the roughness improved momentarily, followed by a strong smell of fuel in the cockpit, which was followed by a complete loss of engine power. Unable to restart the engine, the pilot selected a marshy tree-covered site as a forced landing area. During the forced landing, the airplane collided with trees, and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings. During a postaccident examination, an FAA inspector discovered that the main fuel line between the engine driven fuel pump and the main fuel servo assembly was disconnected, and noted that neither the fuel line nor the connectors were damaged during the accident. A review of the airplane's maintenance records revealed that a maintenance technician had removed the fuel line about 1.9 hours before the accident.

The adhesive is the primary means of holding the strip to the blade, but there are also two rivets on the inboard end of the blade that serve as a secondary securing method.  The abrasion strip fractured at the outboard rivet and the fracture surface revealed evidence of fatigue cracking indicating that the abrasion strip was completely debonded for a period of time.  In addition, dark sooty deposits were visible in the bond area on both sides of the blade.  Maintenance records indicated that the helicopter underwent a 100-hour inspection approximately 62 hours prior to the accident.  The inspection calls for a visual examination of the tail rotor blades to ensure no separation of the bond around the edges or at the tip end of the blade exist.  The inspection process calls for a dye-penetrant inspection or tap test only if a debond is suspected.  However, detection of the debond during the visual only 100-hour inspection would depend on whether the separation intersected on the strip edges.  The preflight examination procedures called for the pilot to visually examine the tail rotor blades to ensure there is no debonding along the abrasion strip-to-airfoil bond line.  The pilot reported that he inspected the abrasion strip prior to the accident flight, but did not notice any evidence of an abrasion strip debond.  The blade accumulated 2,379.7 total hours of operation, and 1,820.6 hours since its last overhaul.",
            "probable_cause": "the in-flight separation of the tail rotor blade abrasion strip due to a degraded adhesive bond and fatigue fracture of the metallic abrasion strip.  The ultimate cause for the degraded bond is unknown."

During the purchase inspection, the pilot reportedly expressed concern about the electronic flight display, the autopilot, the mixture control operation, and the boost pump systems. No additional transition training was accomplished in the airplane before the accident flight. Just before the accident, a witness heard abnormal engine sounds (\u201cpopping\u201d) and observed the airplane flying erratically in the traffic pattern. While maneuvering toward the airport, the airplane's wings were rocking back and forth, which was consistent with a near stalled condition, before the airplane pitched up then entered a nose-down descent into terrain. The previous owner stated that proper mixture control position and boost pump position was critical during landing, or the engine may stumble or experience a brief shutdown. A postaccident examination of the wreckage did not reveal any evidence of preimpact anomalies. It is likely that the pilot, due to his limited training (30 minutes) in the airplane make and model, was unfamiliar with the unique characteristics of this airplane and its avionics, and that contributed to his failure to maintain airspeed while maneuvering.In a 2012 safety study on \"The Safety of Experimental Amateur-Built Aircraft,\" the NTSB concluded that \"purchasers of used [experimental amateur-built] (E-AB) aircraft face particular challenges in transitioning to the unfamiliar E-AB aircraft. Like builders of new E-AB aircraft, they must learn to manage the unique handling characteristics of their aircraft and learn the systems, structure, and equipment, but without the firsthand knowledge afforded to the builder.\" Thus, the NTSB recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration and the Experimental Aircraft Association \"complete planned action to create a coalition of kit manufacturers, type clubs, and pilot and owner groups and (1) develop transition training resources and (2) identify and apply incentives to encourage both builders of experimental amateur-built aircraft and purchasers of used experimental amateur-built aircraft to complete the training that is developed.\"Postmortem toxicology testing for the pilot indicated positive results for ibuprofen, lorazepam and tramadol.
