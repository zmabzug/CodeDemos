During the weeks before the accident, the pilot made several modifications to the airplane in preparation for the trip. Friends and witnesses described the installation of a white plastic fuel tank in the backseat, \"similar to a tank you would see on a riding lawnmower.\" Such a tank is not aviation-approved. The installation included fuel lines that were smaller than recommended by the airplane manufacturer, and the system was vented into the cabin. Local mechanics also reported that the pilot performed his own maintenance to the turbocharger and the exhaust system. In the 2 weeks before the accident, mechanics \"topped off\" the oxygen system twice, the most recent service occurring 3 days before the accident. During that servicing, mechanics noted water leaking from the oxygen line, and the pilot reported trouble breathing at an altitude of 25,000 feet. On the day of the accident, the pilot departed before dawn into instrument meteorological conditions. A witness observed the airplane trailing white and gray smoke, which turned to an orange color, consistent with an in-flight fire. Shortly after, the airplane impacted trees about \u00bd mile north of the departure airport. The airplane was consumed by fire and the investigation was unable to determine the fire's origin; however, evidence of several non-approved modifications to the airplane were observed in the wreckage path, including the non-approved fuel line and valve as well as an aluminum can that was safety-wired to the outlet of the air-oil separator. Such modifications could have likely contributed to the fire's origin or spread. Fueling records from a nearby airport revealed that the pilot purchased fuel twice during the week before the accident. Airport security video showed the pilot placing the fuel hose inside the cabin of the airplane on the dates he purchased fuel, likely to fill the tank that was in the back seat.While the pilot's most recent documented flight time was logged 2 years before the accident, his recent and total flight time could not be confirmed after the accident. Accordingly, the investigation was unable to determine if a lack of recent piloting experience may have contributed to the accident. Although the autopsy also identified coronary artery disease and a mass in the pilot's abdomen, the manner in which the airplane was flown before the accident and the witness report of an inflight fire indicates that the pilot was most likely in control of the airplane and was not incapacitated.",

Please see the public docket for this accident to view the original report.**The pilot reported that, during a black bear-tracking flight while flying the helicopter about 50 feet above tree tops at an airspeed of between 10 and 20 knots with a \"fairly calm\" wind and the engine instruments reading normal, he began a \"fading right turn\" (that is, a right turn with a sideways component of flight leading into it.) During the turn, the pilot input a \"modicum\" of left antitorque pedal while slowing. About 2 seconds after initiating the right turn and while the helicopter was about 30 to 40 feet above the trees, the turn escalated into a right (or clockwise) spin about the main rotor axis despite the pilot's left pedal inputs, which is consistent with a sudden loss of tail rotor authority. The helicopter subsequently impacted trees and terrain. The passenger, who had only been flown once previously in a helicopter, reported that the helicopter spun counterclockwise.Postaccident examinations of the airframe, flight controls, main and tail rotor drive system components, engine, and engine accessories revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Although the pilot and passenger descriptions of the direction of the spin were inconsistent, the lack of any mechanical issue with the helicopter or its engine, the pilot's comment that the engine readings were normal at the start of the turn, and the helicopter's flight condition when the loss of control occurred (operating out of ground effect and turning right at a low airspeed) were consistent with a loss of tail rotor effectiveness during the right turn, resulting in a right (clockwise) spin.",

After he boarded the passengers and loaded the luggage into the airplane, the pilot conducted a preflight inspection and noted that everything was \u201cgood.\u201d During taxi, he asked the air traffic controller if he could take off from runway 3R because it was the longest runway. He then conducted an engine run-up and noted that everything was normal. While holding short of the runway, the pilot heard another pilot ask the controller for a wind check, and the controller replied that the wind was from 300 degrees. Because that would result in a direct crosswind for runway 3R, the pilot asked if runway 34 was available, and the controller replied that it was closed. While waiting for departure, the pilot noted that the windsock seemed to be indicating a slight quartering tailwind. During the takeoff, he applied left aileron because of the crosswind. As he rotated the airplane, \u201csomething didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d The stall warning horn then started \u201cchirping,\u201d and the airplane turned into the wind and did not take off with \u201cits usual vigor.\u201d He leveled off to stop the stall horn and stated that the engine didn\u2019t sound right. He decided to abort the takeoff when the airplane was about 30 ft above ground level (agl). He reduced power and tried to glide the airplane to land. However, shortly thereafter, the stall warning horn \u201cblared,\u201d and the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and impacted the runway. Examination of the wreckage and recorded engine monitor data revealed no evidence of failures or malfunctions.One of the passengers recorded the takeoff and accident sequence on his cell phone. The video showed that, after the pilot rotated the airplane for takeoff, the stall warning horn sounded; the airplane was in a nose-high attitude and had reached an altitude of between 50 and 100 feet agl when the pilot reduced the power. The video then showed the airplane descending until the sound of impact was heard. During the takeoff, the engine sounded constant and normal. The reported wind about the time of the accident was 290 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 18 knots. According to the Aircraft Flight Manual/Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook (AFM/POH), these conditions would have resulted in a crosswind component that, during portions of the takeoff and initial climb, would have exceeded the airplane\u2019s maximum demonstrated crosswind of 17 knots and would have resulted in a 2- to 4-knot tailwind component. Further, two pilots reported low-level windshear at the airport about the time of the accident. No convective echoes existed in the local area about the time of the accident; therefore, a microburst event did not occur at the airport at the time of the accident. High-density altitude conditions existed around the time of the accident, which would also have degraded the airplane\u2019s performance and increased the distance needed for the takeoff roll. The pilot should have accounted for the crosswind, the tailwind, and the high-density altitude conditions in his preflight planning, but he did not do so.\u000b\u000bA review of the pilot\u2019s weight and balance calculations revealed that he underestimated the occupant and baggage weights in his calculations and used an inaccurate airplane empty weight. Recalculations using accurate weights revealed that the airplane was operating at least 100 pounds over the published maximum takeoff weight at the time of the accident and that the center of gravity (CG) was farther aft than the pilot had calculated. The AFM/POH performance charts only provide data for operating up to the airplane\u2019s maximum takeoff weight; it cautions that if loaded above the maximum takeoff weight, the takeoff distance will be longer, the stall speed will be higher, and the climb rate will be lower than that shown in the performance charts. Pilots are expected to perform airplane performance calculations and determine takeoff distances using accurate weight and balance information and taking into account other important factors, such as wind and pressure conditions, that can affect climb performance and takeoff distance. However, the accident pilot did not properly calculate the airplane\u2019s weight and balance during his preflight calculations, and he overloaded the airplane at an aft CG, which would have degraded the airplane\u2019s performance. Further, he did not account for the high-density altitude or wind conditions at the airport at the time of the accident, which would have further degraded the airplane\u2019s performance. Therefore, it is likely that the airplane was not able to achieve a positive climb rate and that its nose was pitched up due to the combined effects of these conditions, which led it to exceed its critical angle-of-attack and subsequently stall. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate preflight planning, which resulted in the airplane being loaded in excess of its maximum gross weight at an aft center of gravity for a takeoff with a quartering tailwind and high-density altitude conditions, all of which degraded the airplane\u2019s climb performance and led to the airplane exceeding its critical angle-of-attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall."

According to the passenger, shortly after departure, she queried the pilot about the airplane's apparent low fuel state. The pilot responded that one of the fuel gauges always indicated more available fuel than the other, and that if necessary they could use fuel from that tank. However, about 15 minutes after departure, the pilot advised air traffic control that the airplane was critically low on fuel. About 5 minutes later, both engines lost total power, and the airplane descended into trees and terrain.Examination of the airframe and engines after the accident confirmed that all of the airplane's fuel tanks were essentially empty, and that the trace amounts of fuel recovered were absent of contamination. Based on the autopsy and toxicology results, the pilot had emphysema, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and severe coronary artery disease; however, given that the passenger did not report any signs of acute incapacitation, and that the pilot did not communicate any medical issues to air traffic control, it does not appear that these conditions affected his performance on the day of the accident.

It is impossible to determine from the available information what direct effect the marijuana alone may have had on the pilot's judgment and psychomotor functioning; however, the combination of marijuana, oxycodone, and gabapentin likely significantly impaired the pilot's judgment and contributed to his failure to ensure the airplane had sufficient fuel to complete the planned flight.",

Tune Airport (JWN), Nashville, Tennessee. The private pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight that departed Great Bend Municipal Airport (GBD), Great Bend, Kansas. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. According to initial information obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the airplane was based at GBD. On the date of the accident, the pilot flew the airplane from the Clarence E. Page Municipal Airport (RCE), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where it had been undergoing maintenance, which included a 150-hour periodic inspection, to GBD. The pilot and three passengers then departed for JWN about 1445, and planned to attend a convention and trade show that was being held in the Nashville area.The flight progressed toward Nashville without incident and the pilot was cleared for a GPS approach to runway 2 at JWN. During the approach, air traffic control informed the pilot that the airplane was about 1/2 mile east of the final approach course, and the pilot reported that he was correcting. The pilot subsequently performed a missed approach and was cleared for a second GPS approach to runway 2. During the second attempt, the airplane was on the final approach course when it veered to the left and began a descent. The airplane had turned to a heading of about 210 degrees before radar contact was lost. There were no distress calls received from the pilot prior to the accident. The airplane impacted trees and a field adjacent to a building, about 9 miles south of JWN. It created an 11-foot-long, 11-foot-wide, 6-foot-deep impact crater. Broken tree branches that contained 45 degree angled cuts were observed at a height of about 50 feet. The airplane impacted the ground at about a 70 degree angle, consistent with being in an inverted position. It was severely fragmented with debris scattered on a course about 320 degrees, for about 450 feet. In addition, a postcrash fire consumed a majority of the airframe. Portions of both outboard wings, the nose section, empennage and all flight control surfaces were located at the accident site. Both engines were impact and fire damaged. They did not display any obvious evidence of catastrophic failure; however, they and the airframe were retained for further examination. Blades from both propellers displayed evidence of rotational scoring with leading and trailing edge gouges consistent with rotation at the time of impact.The airplane was manufactured in 1982. It was powered by two Executive Wings Inc. supplemental type certificate modified Garrett TPE331-5-511K, 715-horsepower engines, equipped with Hartzell three-bladed propeller assemblies. Initial review of maintenance information revealed that at the time of the accident, the airframe and both engines had been operated for about 4,460 total hours since new.A weather observation taken at JWN at 1655 included an overcast ceiling at 800 feet, and a visibility of 5 statute miles.",

The pilot reversed course and landed on a taxiway at the departure airport without further incident. At the time of the event, the airplane and engine had accumulated a total time of 399.3 hours. Metallurgical examination determined that the crankshaft separation was the result of a lubrication failure at the #2 main bearing.  The lubrication failure then allowed excessive friction to overheat the bearing journal on the crankshaft producing ladder cracks in the surface and at the oil transfer hole. These cracks in turn initiated torsional fatigue cracks that ultimately lead to the separation of the crankshaft. The root cause of the lubrication failure was likely the result of intermittent oil flow to the bearing or of improper assembly (fitting) of the bearing shells to the crankshaft. Considering that the other bearings did not show distress and the short time since engine assembly, it is more likely that an assembly issue was the cause.

The controller cleared the airplane to land on either runway 32 or runway 21.  The pilot told the controller, \"Alright uh if you don't mind I'm going to circle around up here and uh see if I can iron out the problem and then uh I'll try to let you know what I need to do.\"  Two minutes later, the controller informed the pilot that he was now eight miles from the airport.  The pilot responded that he had the airport in site.  The controller informed the pilot that runway 32 was the closest runway to his present position to which the pilot responded that he would enter a left base for runway 21.  Nineteen seconds later, the pilot reported he was \"really having problems\" and he was going to land on runway 32.  The pilot then stated that he was losing altitude \"really bad\" and he did not think he was going to make it to the airport.  The airplane contacted a light pole and the terrain along a 4-lane divided roadway.  The pilot was also the aircraft builder.  He installed a supercharger system on the Continental IO-550 engine.

The pilot said the flight was at 11,000 feet msl and encountering some turbulence, when the airplane started to shake violently.  He said he could not control the airplane, and stopped the engine in case it was creating the problem.  The shaking continued until he slowed the airplane to 80 mph.  He restarted the engine, and landed safely.  An examination of the airplane revealed that both wings were structurally damaged.  Prior to the event, the pilot had been taking a digital video with audio through the window of the airplane.  The recording  shows the airplane in a wings level attitude in VFR conditions.  When dropped to the floor after the initiation of the event, the camera continued to record.  The audio recording revealed a vibration for about 3 to 7 seconds in the 8.2 to 8.4 Hz range, which is in the appropriate range for the wing bending/torsional first mode of vibration.  Nothing on the visual or audio recording indicated the airplane was being flown outside its normal operating envelope.  The airplane was examined by aerospace engineers from the Anchorage FAA Aircraft Certification Office.  Damage signatures indicated that the rear spars of both wings oscillated up and down with significant amplitude at span station 92.5.  The bushing holes in the rear spar attachment fittings were elongated, and the right aileron and rudder were severely under-balanced.  The engineers were not able to ascertain if the aileron cable tension was adjusted properly prior to the event.  In 1980, prompted by flutter events, the manufacturer produced Service Bulletin 2/29, relating aileron/wing flutter to more than one of the following four conditions: ailerons not balanced; aileron cables in the wing slack; deterioration in the stiffness of the aileron mounting structure in the fuselage; and/or the airplane being flown outside the limits of the flight manual.  On February 20, 1980, in response to the manufacturer's service bulletin, the FAA issued Airworthiness Directive AD 80-24-02, which required inspections of the airplane's wings, spars, and aileron cable tension and balance, based on service time and part numbers.",

The airplane was owned by D & G Aircraft Leasing LLC, Bountiful, Utah, and operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) personal cross-country flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and the pilot and sole passenger received fatal injuries. The airplane departed Beaver Municipal Airport (U52), Beaver, Utah, about 1715, bound for Mesquite Airport (67L), Mesquite, Nevada, about 140 miles to the southwest. The accident site was on a steep northwest facing canyon wall, in the Virgin River gorge. The gorge was cut by the Virgin River, and was the path followed by U. S. Interstate Highway 15 between St. George, Utah, Littlefield, AZ, and the airplane's destination of Mesquite to the southwest. The airplane impacted a canyon wall, about 100 feet above the Highway. Traveling southwest through the gorge along Highway 15 toward Mesquite, the steep-walled canyon turned left and then to the right, just prior to exiting the gorge onto an open high desert plain, east of Littlefield. The closest official weather reporting station to the accident site was at St. George Airport, about 20 miles east of the accident site. Observations taken between 1800 and 1900 showed that the temperature was in excess of 100 degrees F, and the winds were from 220 degrees true at 16 to 19 knots, with gusts to 23 knots.A motorist traveling southwest bound on Highway 15 reported that the airplane passed low overhead in the canyon, traveling in the same direction as the motorist. The airplane made a left turn following the highway, and suddenly rolled inverted and impacted the canyon wall. The motorist said the conditions in the canyon were very windy.On July 21, the accident airplane was examined at the accident site by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) accompanied by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Safety Inspector. All of the major airframe components and flight controls were present at the site. The wreckage was re-examined at the site on July 22, and removed to a storage facility for further examination at a later time.

He accomplished two stalls (canard only) with no abnormalities encountered. During a third stall, the main wing suddenly stalled without warning. The airplane began to sink rapidly in a level to slightly nose high attitude. The pilot immediately applied full nose down elevator as recommended in the operating handbook, but the airplane did not respond. He applied full power, but the airplane remained unresponsive in pitch. He determined that only the rudders remained mildly effective, and in response, he attempted to roll the airplane in an effort to maneuver the nose down and break the stall. After two unsuccessful attempts, the airplane remained stalled with a high sink rate. As the airplane was neared the ground, the pilot leveled the wings with rudder deflection and kept the engine at full power. The airplane impacted the ground in a level attitude, and almost immediately came to a halt.

The right engine did not power up immediately and the airplane was pulled to the right of the runway centerline.  The pilot said that he was unable to get the airplane back in line with the runway before it hit the ground.  Witnesses said the airplane did not sound right and was weaving back and forth as it approached the runway with its right wing low.  The airplane landed, then bounced several times before it came to a complete stop.  Examination of the airplane revealed that it had sustained substantial damage to the right wing and tail cone. The right main and nose landing gear were also damaged, and all three propeller blades on the right engine were bent aft at the tips.  The airplane was equipped with three fuel tanks in each wing; one inboard of the engine nacelle and two outboard of the engine nacelle. The right wing's two outboard tanks had been disabled and only the right inboard tank was being utilized at the time of the accident.  It appeared to be less than a quarter full.  Approximately two cups of what appeared to be a mixture of brown sludgy debris, water, and blue fuel were drained from the main fuel strainer in the fuselage.",

The power loss occured 7 miles from the intended destination. En route, approximately 150 nm from the destination,  the pilot reported that his \"fuel site gauges indicated 1/2 tank in right wing and just under 1/2 tank in left\" wing. Based on this, he calculated remaining fuel at about 11 gallons, which he determined was sufficient to complete remainder of the flight. The pilot notes in his statement, that he began a slow descent, in preparation to enter the traffic pattern. According to the pilot: \"With 7 NM showing on the GPS, ... and while passing 2,000 [feet] MSL the engine stopped.\" He reported that he attempted a restart, \"but soon felt the controls get mushy,\" and decided to focus his attention on a setting up for a forced landing. He reported that the aircraft was \"topped off\" with 22 gallons of fuel prior to departure. The previous flight lasted 3.6 hours, with a fuel burn of 6.1 gallons per hour (gph), as calculated by the pilot. The accident flight was 3.8 hours. Based on information from the kit manufacturer, the fuel tank configuration installed in the accident aircraft consisted of two 13 gallon wing tanks and a header tank. The wing tanks had an unusable fuel quantity of about 2-1/2 gallons per tank -- 5 gallons total -- when in a descent (nose down attitude). In this configuration, the \"fuel tends to run forward, away from the tank outlet, and during those periods fuel will be provided by the engine from the supply in the header tank,\" according to a service letter issued by the kit manufacturer. The pilot reported the capacity of the header was 3/4 gallon. After a flight of 3.8 hours, at a fuel burn rate of 6.1 gph, approximately 2.8 gallons remained in the wing tanks. The endurance of the 3/4 gallon header tank was approximately 7 minutes, at 6.1 gph. At a ground speed of 120 knots, this equates to about 14 miles.  The pilot reported that his descent began 20 miles from the airport, and the engine quit 7 miles from the airport.",

Witnesses and radar data described the airplane accelerating down the runway to a maximum ground speed of 97 knots, then entering an aggressive climb before leveling and pitching down. The airplane subsequently impacted a parallel taxiway with its landing gear retracted. Slash marks observed on the taxiway pavement, as well as rotation signatures observed on the remaining propeller blades, indicated that both engines were operating at impact. Additionally, postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions of the airframe or either engine. The as-found position of the cargo placed the airplane within the normal weight and balance envelope, with no evidence of a cargo-shift having occurred, and the as-found position of the elevator trim jackscrew was consistent with a neutral pitch trim setting. According to the airframe manufacturer's prescribed takeoff procedure, the pilot was to accelerate the airplane to an airspeed of 85 knots, increase the pitch to a climb angle that would allow the airplane to accelerate past 96 knots, and retract the landing gear before accelerating past 128 knots. Given the loading and environmental conditions that existed on the night of the accident, the airplane's calculated climb performance should have been 1,800 feet per minute. Applying the prevailing wind conditions about time of the accident to the airplane's radar-observed ground speed during the takeoff revealed a maximum estimated airspeed of 111 knots, and the airplane's maximum calculated climb rate briefly exceeded 3,000 feet per minute.

At 800 feet agl, the captain called for the climb checklist.  It was about this time that the captain noticed that he could not trim nose down.  The captain had the first officer check his trim switch and the backup system.  They did not respond.  The captain elected to bring the airplane back to ORD.  The captain said that both he and the first officer had their control yokes pushed forward to the stop and were still climbing.  The captain said he was finally able to stop the climb and level the airplane at approximately 8,000 feet.  The captain said they declared an emergency and referred to the Pitch Trim 1 and 2 Failure checklists.  The checklist directed they lower flaps to 9 degrees.  \"When we brought in the flaps, the aircraft pitched way nose high.  We were out of control.\"  The captain regained control of the airplane and had the first officer retract the flaps.  The captain said they lowered the landing gear.  It improved the airplane's stability slightly.  They pulled and reset the trim circuit breakers twice.  These actions did nothing.  The captain said he lined up for an approach to runway 9R.  The captain determined he was too high to land, so he executed a 360-degree descending turn.  On completion of the turn, the captain said they needed to slow down so they deployed the spoilers.  The captain said the airplane abruptly pitched way up.  The captain said he and the first officer pushed both yokes forward.  The captain advanced the throttles, and retracted the spoilers.  \"That second, I banked hard left, 50 to 60 degrees as I recall, and chopped the power. It took all our abilities to get the nose down.\"  After they got the airplane back under control, the captain said approach control informed them that runway 4R was straight ahead.  The captain elected to land on runway 4R.  The captain said he left the airplane configured as it was (landing gear down, flaps and spoilers retracted) and flew a long shallow approach.  \"I said to myself, God please let me land this airplane.  Over the runway, I chopped the power and let it settle on the runway.\"  A post-incident examination of the airplane's spoiler control unit revealed that when the spoilers were given the command to retract, the unit was not sending an input to the horizontal stab control unit (HSCU) to put in 1 unit of nose down stabilizer trim.  Examinations of the trim system components and the other airplane systems revealed no anomalies.  Following the incident, the airplane's manufacturer revealed that the horizontal stab actuator was determined to be inadequate to move the horizontal stabilizer in all flight conditions.  \"The incidents are most likely caused when the flight crew fails to trim the airplane after takeoff before reaching a certain airspeed where the air loads on the stabilizer may overpower the trim actuator, resulting in the horizontal stabilizer not responding to the pitch trim command from the flight crew.\"  The manufacturer issued an alert service bulletin mandating the installation of a cockpit placard and revisions to the airplane flight manual establishing a maximum speed of 160 knots to pitch-trim after takeoff.  The FAA issued an emergency AD mandating the installation of the cockpit placard and revisions to the airplane flight manual.  The FAA has also tasked the manufacturer to make design changes that will enable the trim actuator to handle increased load limits. The FAA has also mandated changes that will provide improved pitch trim failure indications and ergonomic improvements of the yoke trim switches.",

He said that he figured the people, baggage, and fuel for the trip and determined that there would be enough fuel to fly from Pontiac to Mackinac Island, and then from Mackinac Island to Pellston, Michigan.  The pilot said he planned to refuel at Pellston because they don't sell fuel at the Mackinac Island Airport.  He said that when he taxied out for departure from Mackinac Island, he had 12 gallons of fuel in each tank.  He said that Pellston was 10 minutes away.  After takeoff, the pilot contacted ARTCC and received vectors to the ILS approach for Pellston.  The weather at Pellston was ceilings of 800 broken, 1,500 overcast, 2-1/2 miles visibility with moderate rain.  While on the localizer, the pilot reported losing the localizer.  ARTCC provided vectors to the localizer.  The pilot informed the controller he was low on fuel.  The pilot intercepted the localizer and reported he was established on the approach.  Three minutes later, the pilot informed ARTCC he was missed approach.  The ARTCC controller asked the pilot what his intentions were.  The pilot said he was low on fuel and needed to get down, and requested if there was an airport nearby that had good visibility.  The controller provided weather information for several airports and a pilot report for Charlevoix.  After considering the options, the pilot elected to proceed to Charlevoix and then decided to go to Gaylord, Michigan.  Approximately 6 minutes later, the pilot reported losing an engine.  The controller told the pilot the Harbor Springs Airport (D87) was 8 miles southeast of his position and asked the pilot if he still wanted to go to Gaylord?  The pilot said yes.  The controller asked the pilot if he had any approach plates for D87.  The pilot said that he didn't have enough fuel to make D87.  The controller said that D87 was now 8 miles in front of him and that he was set up for the RNAV approach to runway 10.  The pilot said he would need help with the instructions to fly the approach.  The pilot and the controller exchanged information for the approach.  Approximately 13 minutes after losing the first engine, the pilot reported losing his other engine.  The controller gave the pilot vectors to get him back toward D87.  The pilot said that when he came out of the clouds he was 300 to 400 feet above the water.

Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots.  Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C."

They were sharing flight duties on the third of a series of flights together, after the pilot rated passenger performed pilot duties on the second flight. Low clouds and fog prevailed; however, no weather briefing was obtained, other than checking the ATIS of a nearby airport. The pilots were receiving VFR advisories, and proceeding toward an uncontrolled airport located near a ridge that was higher in elevation than the altitude of the airplane. According to the pilot, the passenger was flying the aircraft, and they were navigating by dead reckoning. The approach controller asked the pilot if she was familiar with 'the ridge just to the north of slatington.'  She replied that she was, but could not see it. As the flight continued, she was given the relative bearing and distance to the airport twice. After the second advisory, engine power was increased, and a turn toward the airport was initiated. However, the airplane collided with wooded/rocky terrain at the top of a mountain, about 3-1/2 miles northeast of the airport.

Additionally, prior to the incident tow he had not received recurrent tow training since being away from the ramp for the previous 6 years.  On the date of the incident, he towed 4 airplanes before the incident tow.  Additionally, he had never received training in, nor towed the incident make and model airplane prior to the incident tow.  American Airline\u2019s procedures did not require tow training for a Boeing 777 airplane if the tow was conducted for maintenance, and the person had wide body tow training.  The tow training curriculum for a Boeing 777 was not in place at the time of the incident.  Additionally, the tow tug driver reported that he was not familiar with markings on the ramp which specified wide body airplanes were required to use spot 6C, not 6S, or 6N, which was covered by a NOTAM issued in August 2001.  The purpose of the tow was to reposition the Boeing 777 airplane from a gate to a maintenance hangar; the tow tug driver did not brief the tow crew about the tow.  Just before the tow began, the American Airlines Tower Coordinator (Tower Coordinator) advised the brake rider that the airplane was cleared to push 6 center out.  The brake rider reportedly relayed the same instructions to the tow tug driver but he (tow tug driver) reported he was not advised what route to follow.  The tow began with wing walkers, then as forward motion began, they left the tow.  The airplane began following the line 6S and at that time, communication between the Tower Coordinator and brake rider began; the Tower Coordinator advising the brake rider that the airplane was being towed on line 6S instead of 6C.  The brake rider advised the Tower Coordinator he knew, and had attempted to communicate with the tow tug driver and also flashed the airplanes landing and taxi lights numerous times in an attempt to get the tow tug drivers attention.  The tow continued on line 6S, and the tow tug driver elected to stop the airplane short of spot 6, as he had not heard from the brake rider.  He got out of the tug and noted the headset cord was lying on the ground, the male end was still connected to the airplane.  He was then advised of damage to the tow airplane and damage to the rudder of an Boeing 737 airplane parked at gate E34 with passengers on-board awaiting pushback.  The captain of the Boeing 737 parked at the gate reported that he and the first officer were going through the checklist and with the parking brake engaged, they felt a movement.  He then had the jet bridge brought back in position, exited the airplane for inspection, and noted the damage to the rudder.

He performed several ground runs and taxi tests prior to the accident; the pilot\u2019s first flight in the airplane took place on the day of the accident and lasted about 1 hour. About 30 minutes later, during the initial climb-out on the second flight, the engine began to vibrate and lose power. The propeller then stopped rotating and the pilot performed a forced landing into a wooded area.During the postaccident examination, the engine was successfully started and operated. The pilot's installation of paper-element fuel filters was contrary to the engine manufacturer\u2019s recommendations; however, according to the engine manufacturer, it is unlikely that this installation would have resulted in the loss of power. The fuel pump was located on the engine mount, just above the engine, and, while this location could potentially make it prone to excessive heat and vibration, it had been so positioned for many flight hours prior to the accident. Examination of the airplane did not reveal any mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.",
