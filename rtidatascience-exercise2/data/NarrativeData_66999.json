He climbed to his cruising altitude, and flew on the right main fuel tank until the fuel was exhausted. He switched the fuel selector to the left main fuel tank and requested a lower altitude from air traffic control (ATC). During the approved descent the engine lost power. He turned on the boost pump and the engine continued to windmill. The pilot stated that he did not engage the starter because he expected the engine to start. He switched the fuel selector back to the right main fuel tank, then left main fuel tank, and back to the right main fuel tank. The engine did not start and the left main fuel tank gauge indicated low. He checked the global position system for the nearest airport, cancelled his instrument flight plan with the air traffic controller, and continued direct to the airport, entering a left downwind while descending. The engine attempted to start and stopped. The pilot turned base, and lowered the landing gear very close to the ground after clearing trees. The left wing stalled, the left wing tip and nose of the airplane collided with the ground, and the airplane came to a complete stop upright. The pilot further stated, \" As far as I can tell, I landed without fuel.\" ",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.Shortly after takeoff, and about 3 miles from the airport, the airplane crashed into desert terrain near a rural residential area.  The airplane had been flown to the departure airport earlier in the day for a certified flight instructor (CFI) multiengine check ride by the examinee, his CFI, and a multiengine rated private pilot passenger.  No discrepancies were noted with that portion of the flight.  During the engine run-up for the check ride, both the designated pilot examiner (DPE) and examinee noted that the left engine was not producing sufficient power for the pre-takeoff engine check.  They cycled the engine at higher and lower mixture settings before they could conduct a normal run-up.  After completing a simulated engine failure, the check ride continued with a normal takeoff.  Towards the departure end of the runway, the DPE observed a loss of climb performance and noted that the left engine's manifold pressure was at 21.5-22.0 inches.  They were going to make an off airport landing; however, they were able to gain enough altitude to land back at the airport.  He also noted that, on the downwind leg for landing, the right engine oil temperature was near the upper limit, and the oil pressure showed a decrease toward the lower limit.  On final, the oil pressure for the right engine dropped further near the lower redline limit.  Once they landed, the oil pressure and oil temperature returned to normal.  The pilots decided to do another run-up check, but during the check, the left engine was not developing power equal to that of the right engine, so they discontinued the check ride and taxied back to the ramp.  The DPE discussed the situation with the CFI, who then called the flight school's mechanic and discussed the situation with him.  Both the CFI and mechanic felt that the check ride should be discontinued, but it was safe to fly the airplane back to home base.  The DPE observed the occupants board the airplane and reported that the CFI sat in back, with the examinee in the right front seat, and the private pilot in the left front seat.  The airplane yawed to the left three times during the takeoff roll; each time the airplane returned to the runway centerline and the ground roll continued.  The airplane lifted off after a long ground roll and gained altitude very slowly.  The witnesses indicated that the airplane sounded normal during the takeoff.  A few minutes later a loud shriek was heard on the UNICOM frequency, and a few minutes after that they were notified of an airplane down by local law enforcement.  A post impact ground fire thermally destroyed the aircraft, and severely damaged the engine accessories and controls.  No discrepancies were found during an examination of the airframe.  Mechanical and valve train continuity were established for both engines.  A differential compression check was conducted on both engines.  The compression check for the left engine revealed low pressure on the numbers 2 and 4 cylinders.  Both cylinders were staked with no difference noted in the number 2 cylinder.  The number 4 cylinder had an improved compression reading.  The numbers 2 and 4 cylinders were removed for further inspection.  No internal discrepancies were noted with either the number 2 or 4 cylinders.  Due to the degree of thermal destruction, no meaningful tests could be performed on the fuel or ignition system components.  Ground scars and impact damage indicated that the airplane hit the ground in a steep left bank attitude and tumbled, which could be consistent with a loss of power on the left engine and a failure of the flying pilot to maintain an adequate airspeed above single engine minimum control airspeed.  The anatomical evidence on the occupants was inconclusive as to who may have been manipulating the flight controls at the time of impact.",
            "probable_cause": "a loss of engine power in the left engine for undetermined reasons, and the failure of the flying pilot to maintain an adequate single engine minimum control airspeed and aircraft control.  Also causal was the decision of all three of the pilots to continue the flight with known engine discrepancies."

Data recovered from a handheld GPS device showed that the helicopter lifted off from the helipad and began accelerating forward while turning right and maintaining a relatively constant altitude.

The helicopter subsequently impacted trees and terrain.Although the weather reporting stations closest to the accident site and at the destination airport generally reported that visual meteorological conditions prevailed, the presence of calm wind, near-coincident temperatures and dew points, and the clear night sky favored the formation of patch radiation fog and/or dew on the surface. Visible satellite imagery captured about 1 hour after the accident depicted a band of low stratiform clouds or fog/mist over the accident site and along the adjacent river valley. Additionally, several witnesses near the helipad reported that the lighting and weather conditions about the time of the accident were \u201cdark\u201d and \u201cfoggy.\u201d Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.The helicopter was not equipped to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Although the airline transport-rated pilot possessed airplane and helicopter instrument ratings, his most recent instrument proficiency check was completed about 8 months before the accident in an airplane, not a helicopter, and no evidence was found indicating that he was current or proficient in operating a helicopter in IMC. Regardless, the fog should have been an indication to the pilot that IMC existed, and he should not have decided to operate the helicopter in such conditions. The flight profile and the presence of radiation fog during dark night conditions, which would have obscured visual references such as the trees, are consistent with the pilot having experienced spatial disorientation, specifically a vestibular illusion known as the \u201cgraveyard spiral.\u201d",

This condition resulted in an engine overtorque and overtemperture condition, and the captain shut down the left engine. After the engine shutdown, both primary flight display screens went blank. The captain reset the right generator and the flight displays regained power and display. Due to the engine shutdown, the captain diverted to a nearby airport and attempted a single-engine precautionary landing in visual flight rules conditions. Based on wind conditions at the airport (290 degrees at 18 knots), runway 27 was being used for operations. During the descent, the crew became confused as to their true heading and were only able to identify runway 27 about a minute before touching down due to a 50-degree difference in heading indications displayed to the crew as a result of the instrument gyros having been reset. Accurate heading information would have been available to the crew had they referenced the airplane\u2019s compass. Having declared an emergency, the crew was cleared to land on any runway and chose to land on runway 18. After touchdown, the captain applied reverse thrust on the right engine and the airplane veered to the right. The airplane flight manual\u2019s single-engine approach and landing checklist indicates that after landing braking and reverse thrust are to be used as required to maintain airplane control. The airplane continued to the right, departed the runway surface, impacted terrain, flipped over, and came to rest inverted. At the point of touchdown, there was about 5,000 feet of runway remaining for the landing roll. The loss of directional control was likely initiated when the captain applied reverse thrust shortly after touchdown, and was likely aggravated by the strong crosswind. Postaccident examination of the airplane showed a clevis pin incorrectly installed by unknown maintenance personnel that resulted in a jammed left engine power lever. No additional anomalies were noted with the airplane or engines that would have precluded normal operation.",

Contributing to the accident was an improperly installed clevis pin in the left engine power lever, the crew\u2019s delay in accurately identifying their heading, and their subsequent selection of a runway with a strong crosswind."

The controller made numerous advisory calls to the pilot to direct him back toward the localizer course; however, though the airplane initially made corrections back toward the localizer course, it subsequently turned again toward the right. Radar data indicate that the airplane continued to descend while flying a serpentine track to the right of the localizer course until it made one final turn back toward the localizer and entered a low altitude stall/spin. Immediately prior to entering the stall/spin, the pilot stated over the radio \"gotta go.\" No mechanical anomalies were noted with the airplane and no physical anomalies were noted with the pilot. While the airplane was equipped with a parachute system that, contrary to the checklists, was not armed by the pilot before flight, the low altitude at which the pilot lost control of the airplane would have made a successful deployment doubtful even with the system armed. The pilot and a passenger were fatally injured, one person on the ground was seriously injured, and two others received minor injuries when the airplane impacted automobiles and terrain.",

She noted that the winds were variable and gusty, and it was \"choppy\" in the pattern.  The accident occurred on what was to be the final landing for the day.  The pilot reported that the airplane was established on final approach about 65 knots.  The airplane was slightly low, but she did not feel the need to correct the glide path.  The airplane touched down and its nose suddenly turned to the left.  As the nose went to the left, the airplane bounced.  She \"gently lowered the nose, but the plane bounced again and again.\"  Her efforts to regain control were not successful and the airplane ultimately came to rest in a grass area to the left side of the runway.

While attempting to return, the pilot allowed the main rotor rpm to decay and while descending, the helicopter contacted a building, trellis, and then the ground. Inspection of the helicopter revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction of the flight controls, main rotor or tail rotor drive systems. The engine was removed from the helicopter and test run after proper timing of the right magneto; no discrepancies were noted. The engine had been overhauled approximately 124 hours earlier; overhauled magnetos were installed at that time. The engine had been inspected three times since the overhauled engine was installed; the last 100-Hour inspection was approximately 29 hours earlier.

Appendix D specified that the engine accessories are to be checked for apparent defects in security of mounting. There was no record that the magnetos had been removed since the overhauled engine was installed. The cause of the loss of engine power was determined to be caused by rotation (advance) of the right magneto which was due to an incorrect gasket and also by undetected fracture of the clamping flange.

The operator reported that approximately 35 minutes into flight, the aircraft suddenly yawed \"violently\" to the right with slight nose tuck.  The tail rotor pedals were simultaneously driven to near full right position.  The co-pilot immediately reduced collective and IAS, corrected with left pedal while canceling the Flight Director.  The aircraft oscillated twice at medium intensity and relatively small magnitude.  Control of the aircraft was then passed to the pilot-in-command who reestablished straight and level flight at reduced power, with full right pedal required.

In-flight troubleshooting revealed no remedial effect from securing one or both Helipilot SAS systems.  Hydraulic systems not cycled, but pressure was noted as \"normal\" on both systems.

The accident airplane was modified with a Soloy engine conversion, which replaced the Continental TSIO-520 reciprocating engine with a Rolls Royce-Allison 250-C20S turbine engine.  The engine was not equipped with an auto-ignition or continuous ignition system.  The commercial pilot was utilizing the engine deice prior to encountering icing conditions, and selected alternate engine air once he perceived snow.  The pilot reported that the engine lost power shortly after the engine alternate air was selected.  The pilot-rated passenger feathered and secured the engine prior to establishing a best glide speed.  The pilot attempted to restart the engine on numerous occasions; however, he was unable to obtain the 12 percent N1 required for engine start.  As the airplane entered visual meteorological conditions, the pilot selected a gravel area for the forced landing.  Examination of the engine revealed that the engine's anti-ice line was separated from the compressor case.  Metallurgical examination of the anti-ice line revealed that its mounting pad separated from the compressor case as a result of fatigue cracking.  The fatigue cracking originated from the braze joint, which displayed oxidation.  According to the engine manufacturer and the engine conversion representative, the broken anti-ice line would have prevented heated air from entering the engine inlet guide vanes even with the engine deice selected.  When the pilot selected the engine alternate air, relatively warm air was introduced into the engine inlet, dislodging any accumulated ice, and subsequently flaming out the engine.  According to maintenance records, the engine underwent its last 100-hour inspection  approximately 29 hours prior to the accident. A review of the engine operations manual revealed that due to thermal differences, the gas producing section of the engine may lock up after an in-flight engine shutdown, requiring the flight crew to wait up to 10 minutes before a successful restart.",

The pilot reported he was cruising at 3,000 feet msl when he heard a loud bang from the engine, followed almost immediately by smoke from beneath the left side panel and excessive vibration from the engine.  The engine lost power and the pilot executed a forced landing.  During landing roll out, the nose wheel struck a rock and the nose gear collapsed.  An inspection of the engine revealed that a connecting rod had punched a hole in the engine case.  The number 2 piston rod, rod bearing, and rod journal were discolored and exhibited heat distress.  The crankshaft was broken in two pieces at the number 2 cheek.  A fatigue fracture was observed on the fracture surfaces of the number 2 cheek.  The engine was originally a 230 horsepower Continental O-470-R that was converted to a 270 horsepower O-470-50, as a result of Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) #SE4985NM.  This STC required the cylinders to be replaced with the  same cylinders and pistons used on Continental O-520 engines.  The crankshaft, forging number 539664, S/N S401, and heat code E99, referred to as a \"wide-rod\" crankshaft, was manufactured in the 1960's and was originally used on Continental Motors O-470 and IO-470 engines.  The crankshaft had not been replaced since the STC conversion on December 23, 1994.  It had accumulated 1,259.0 hours since the STC conversion.  The engine teardown revealed that the pistons installed on the engine were 8.5 to 1 compression pistons used on normally aspirated Continental O-520 engines.  The P. Ponk Aviation STC SE4985NM specifies that the 7.5 to 1 compression pistons are the proper pistons to use in the engine conversion.  On September 24, 2002, P. PONK AVIATION, issued a Service Information Letter, SIL 002, that stated, \"Use of the \"wide-rod\" crankshaft with any piston higher than the 7.5 to 1 compression ratio and a maximum rpm above 2700 is not authorized by our STC and could result in engine failure.  Our testing did not exceed the above parameters, and we do not condone or support installation of the higher compression pistons.\"  No logbook entries indicated any of the pistons had been changed since the engine was converted to an O-470-50, on December 23, 1994, and only the # 3 cylinder was changed on April 15, 2000, due to low compression.  The engine build-up records that documented what parts were installed on the engine during the STC conversion no longer existed. ",

The incident occurred during the day shift with a front line manager and two air traffic control specialists on position.  The ground controller had been on position for 40 minutes and was responsible for five aircraft.  N316AS had landed on runway 19 and requested a back taxi to runway 19.

To perform this examination, the FAA inspector announced the beginning of the simulated power loss procedure and moved the fuel flow control lever out of the flight detent (the full forward, full open position) and back just enough to keep the lever from springing back into the detent; this was done to ensure that the engine was not supplying power to the rotor system during the autorotation. However, when the fuel flow control lever was moved, the helicopter yawed right and the generator out warning light illuminated, indicating that the engine had flamed out. The pilot briefly attempted a restart, but the engine exceeded the temperature limit and he discontinued the start attempt. Because of their close proximity to the ground, there was inadequate time to attempt another restart of the engine. The pilot-in-command (PIC) identified and proceeded toward a forced landing site. Due to obstructing trees in the touchdown zone below the area where the simulated engine out was conducted, the PIC overflew the trees with up collective input, leading to a decay of the main rotor rpm. Thereafter, insufficient rotor rpm remained to cushion the touchdown. Also, because of down-sloping terrain, the distance between the helicopter and ground level increased seconds before landing, thereby increasing the helicopter's absolute altitude and contributing to a hard impact with the ground.The fuel control unit and the power turbine governor were removed from the engine and taken to a test facility where they were installed on calibrated test benches and tested in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s test procedures. The results of the fuel control unit test showed that the internal parts all worked properly; however, the fuel flow at every test point was below the specified minimum limit. The results of the power turbine governor test revealed that the unit was out of specified limits at each test point. The discrepancies noted would affect the fuel flow at the high end of the schedule and is indicative of an improper rigging procedure. Examination of the unit showed that the maximum stop setting had been adjusted in the field and that the travel was set at 80 degrees instead of the required 86 degrees.While some of the discrepancies found during the tests of the fuel control unit and the power turbine governor are not serious, those at the low end of the fuel schedule are of particular concern. The minimum fuel flow, idle, and the cut-off settings were found to be below the manufacturer\u2019s specified minimum limits; when combined with hysteresis, or the lagging of a physical effect on a body behind its cause, the chances of insufficient fuel flow being delivered to the engine during any engine deceleration maneuver (i.e., moving the throttle out of the flight detent) increases dramatically. When the FAA inspector moved the fuel flow control lever as the pilot was manipulating the collective during the beginning of the autorotation, it is likely that the unloading of the engine sent a signal to the fuel control unit to rapidly decrease the fuel flow at the same time the fuel control lever was being brought out of the flight detent and moved aft, which helped induce the flameout.Review of the operator\u2019s flight and maintenance records found a pilot write-up that noted that about 9 months prior to the accident the engine had flamed out when the throttle was manipulated during the start sequence. The operator\u2019s maintenance department was unable to find a reason for the event and released the helicopter back to service. The company pilots were aware that this particular helicopter had a \u201ctouchy throttle.\u201d The pilot noted that, when operating the throttle lever in this particular helicopter, \u201cyou have to be gentle and slow with it as you retard the lever\u2026if you pull it back to far or fast, it will shut off the fuel.\u201d At least four prior instances of flameouts as a result of minor throttle movements were uncovered in deposition testimony of company pilots. All occurred on the ground and three of the flameouts happened as pilots were bringing the fuel flow control lever back toward ground idle during the post-flight engine cool down period. These instances were not documented in the maintenance records, and no records of attempted remediation were found.",
            "probable_cause": "An uncommanded engine shutdown due to an improperly calibrated fuel control unit (FCU) and power turbine governor (PTG). Also causal was the operator\u2019s inadequate maintenance practices and procedures that failed to properly assess and correct the FCU and PTG irregularities/deficiencies. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration inspector\u2019s selection of an area for the simulated engine failure that offered limited choices for a full-touchdown autorotation."

The captain stated that during the after start checklist he moved the power levers to disengage the start locks on the propellers.  Post accident examination found that the left propeller was still in the start lock position, while the right propeller was in the normal operating range.  The captain was the pilot flying (PF) and the second-in-command (SIC) was the nonflying pilot (NFP).  After receiving their clearance, the PF taxied onto the runway and initiated the takeoff sequence.  The SIC did not set and monitor the engine power during takeoff, as required by the company procedures.  During the takeoff acceleration when the speed was between 40 and 60 knots, the captain released the nose gear steering control switch as the rudder became aerodynamically effective.  When the switch was released, the airplane began immediately veering left due to the asymmetrical thrust between the left and right engine propellers.  The PIC did not advise the SIC that he had lost directional control and was aborting the takeoff, as required by company procedures.  The distance between where the PIC reported that he began the takeoff roll and where the first tire marks became apparent was about 630 feet, and the distance between where the marks first became apparent and where the airplane's left main landing gear tire marks exited the left side of the runway was about 220 feet.  Thereafter, marks (depressions in the dirt) were noted for a 108-foot-long distance in the field located adjacent to the runway.  Medium intensity tire tread marks were apparent on the parallel taxiway and the adjacent vehicle service road.  These tread marks, over a 332-foot-long distance, led directly to progressively more pronounced marks and rubber transfer, and to the accident airplane's landing gear tires.  Based on an examination of tire tracks and skid marks, the PIC did not reject the takeoff until the airplane approached the runway's edge, and was continuing its divergent track away from the runway's centerline.  The airplane rolled on the runway through the dirt median and across a taxiway for 850 feet prior to the PIC applying moderate brakes, and evidence of heavier brake application was apparent only a few hundred feet from the impacted hangar.  No evidence of preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions was found with the propeller assemblies, nose wheel steering mechanism, or brakes.",

The loss of directional control was caused by the crew's failure to follow prescribed pretakeoff and takeoff checklist procedures to ensure the both propellers were out of the start locks.  Contributing factors were the failure of the crew to follow normal company procedures during takeoff, the failure of the flightcrew to recognize an abnormal propeller condition during takeoff, and a lack of crew coordination in performing a rejected takeoff.

This was a tour flight that was en route back to the departure airport when a complete hydraulic system failure occurred and the pilot decided to make a precautionary landing at a nearby airport.  He had planned on conducting a run-on landing; however, during the approach the airspeed dropped to 30 knots.  The helicopter's nose dropped and it started to spin to the left.  The pilot pulled back on the cyclic enough to get the nose up; however, forward airspeed continued to decay and the rotation rate increased.  The pilot said that the flight controls were not responding, and he believed the only way to stop or slow the rotation was to shutdown the engine.  The helicopter completed two revolutions before it impacted the ground in a nose level attitude, 180 degrees from its original direction of travel.  A witness to the accident reported the altitude of the helicopter as it began to spin was about 30-50 feet above the ground and he saw the main rotor blades cone upward as it fell to the ground.  For a hydraulics failure, Federal Aviation Administration approved flight manual required the pilot to reduce the collective pitch and adjust the airspeed between 40 to 60 knots in level flight.  The pilot was then instructed to cut off the hydraulic pressure by activating the collective lever pushbutton, and to make a flat approach over a clear landing area and land with forward speed.  During examination of the hydraulic pump, investigators noted that the coupling sleeve splines were worn beyond serviceable limits.  They also noted the general condition as rust colored, and no lubrication was found inside the pump housing or coupling sleeve splines.  A company maintenance work order contained a serviceable tag for the hydraulic pump assembly.  The serviceable tag that the operator's maintenance personnel wrote said that the hydraulic pump was \"inspected, cleaned filter, new O rings installed on connections, inspected coupling, new pump assembled.\"  The maintenance records also revealed that the assembled hydraulic pump was installed 15 days prior to the accident and had been in service for 74.6 hours when it failed.  A metallurgical examination of the hydraulic pump revealed that it had failed due to the wearing away of the splines on the coupling sleeves.  The wear was due to insufficient lubrication and soft splines on both coupling sleeves.  The failure mode was assisted by an increase in internal rotational resistance at operating temperatures.  The hardness testing indicated that the case hardened layer on the splines was not deep enough and the hardness, within the layer, was slightly below the specified range.  The inner surfaces of the gear bearings displayed rubbed areas, consistent with hard contact, and areas of bluing, consistent with elevated temperatures.  Examination of the coupling sleeves revealed a total loss of inwardly protruding spline material and hardness below the design requirements.  The manufacturer's maintenance manual requires that the pump drive shaft, coupling sleeves, and bearing be packed with \"abundant\" grease during assembly.  The examination found only a trace amount of grease in the coupling sleeves that did not satisfy the \"abundant\" requirement specified in the manufacturer's maintenance manual.  There was rust on the front retaining rings and bearings, which indicated that there was insufficient grease in the splines to retain it or lubricate the splines.",

The LC directed the pilot to report entering a left downwind, and the pilot continued on southerly heading for 4 miles before turning right to a southwesterly heading. The Piper pilot contacted the LC and reported 10 miles to the north of the airport. The LC directed the Piper pilot to enter a left downwind stating, \"Cessna four five zero republic report entering left down\", and the Piper pilot acknowledged, \"left downwind for runway one ninner.\"  The LC subsequently informed the Cessna pilot that he had possible traffic off his eleven o'clock position at a half-mile westbound at 1,000 feet. The Cessna pilot responded, \"seven two mike looking for traffic.\" Forty one seconds later, the Piper pilot informed the LC of the collision and declared an emergency. The LC stated in an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board  that he scanned the runways, traffic pattern, final approach course, and the remote automated radar display (RACD), when he noticed two VFR targets northeast of the field close to one another. Assuming the target on a southwesterly heading was a VFR helicopter passing to the north of the airport, the LC issued possible traffic to the southbound aircraft, assuming it was the Cessna pilot when it was actually the Piper pilot, and the Cessna pilot acknowledged the traffic call. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, paragraph 2-1-1, Air Traffic Service:  \"The primary purpose of the ATC system is to prevent a collision between aircraft operating in the system and to organize and expedite the flow of traffic, and to provide support for National Security and Homeland Defense. In addition to its primary function, the ATC system has the capability to provide (with certain limitations) additional services. The ability to provide additional services is limited by many factors, such as the volume of traffic, frequency congestion, quality of radar, controller workload, higher priority duties, and the pure physical inability to scan and detect those situations that fall in this category. The provision of additional services is not optional on the part of the controller, but rather is required when the work situation permits.\"  According to the FAA, traffic advisories to VFR aircraft is considered an additional service. In addition, paragraph 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories:  \"Unless an aircraft is operating within Class A airspace or omission is requested by the pilot, issue traffic advisories to all aircraft (IFR or VFR) on your frequency when, in your judgment, their proximity may diminish to less than the applicable separation minima. Where no separation minima applies, such as for VFR aircraft outside of Class B/Class C airspace, or a TRSA, issue traffic advisories to those aircraft on your frequency when in your judgment their proximity warrants it.
