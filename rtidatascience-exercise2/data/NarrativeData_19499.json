A witness reported that he heard a single-engine airplane flying overhead and that he heard the engine changing pitch, which made him immediately look up. He saw what appeared to be a single-engine airplane doing \u201cloops\u201d near his house. He was able to see the silhouette of the airplane and the two white strobes under its wing tips. The engine pitch dropped as the airplane was climbing. About 3 seconds, later the witness could see the red and green lights on the airplane\u2019s wing tips, as well as the strobes again as the engine pitch increased. He observed the airplane as it made \u201ca couple more loops.\u201d The airplane appeared to level out and continue flying west-northwest and, about 1 minute later, it made a turn toward the north. The airplane was located the following day in a wooded area about 5 miles from the witness\u2019s home. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and the airplane was flying over sparsely lighted terrain at the time of the accident. The crash debris field indicated that the airplane was in a shallow, controlled descent at impact. Examination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Based on the available information, it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation before impacting the ground.Although toxicological testing of the pilot\u2019s blood specimens showed potentially lethal carbon monoxide levels, the testing also showed very low hemoglobin concentration, which suggests significant contamination (possibly during postaccident firefighting activities) that made the sample unsuitable for accurate testing. Examination of the airplane\u2019s debris path found evidence to preclude any possibility that the pilot inhaled carbon monoxide during the postcrash fire, and examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of any precrash leaks in the exhaust system. Further, the pilot demonstrated the ability to talk coherently to air traffic controllers about 1 hour before the accident and to operate and maneuver the airplane during the flight. Given the absence of any detectable exhaust leak in the airplane, the uncertain quality of the specimen used for toxicological testing, the lack of confirmatory testing, and the pilot\u2019s demonstrated abilities during the flight, it is unlikely that the pilot experienced any significant premortem exposure to carbon monoxide.Ethanol was detected in multiple tissues of the pilot, and the levels suggest that there was some degree of postmortem ethanol formation, although the levels also suggest that some of the alcohol present was from ingestion; however, the contamination of the pilot\u2019s blood specimens raises the possibility that the detected ethanol levels are misleading as well.

During the autorotation the pilot was forced to increase collective pitch in order to clear a berm resulting in a loss of main rotor RPM.  The helicopter landed hard and remained in the upright position.  A review of the turbine engine's maintenance records and work orders revealed the engine had been repaired and inspected in December 2005 for \"a sudden stoppage.\"  At that time, the compressor, gearbox, and turbine were replaced.  A teardown examination of the engine revealed that the aft end of the turbine-to-compressor coupling had fractured in the region where it mated with the turbine splined adapter.  The coupling fracture resulted in a loss of continuity in the N1 drive train and an overspeed failure of the first stage turbine wheel.  Metallurgical examination of the fracture surfaces of the remnants of the first stage turbine wheel revealed there was no fatigue fractures.  Examination of the splines in the aft end of the coupling and on the pieces from the fractured section revealed fretting and a fractured spline tip in the area of contact with the turbine spline adapter.  There was non-uniform wear on 16 consecutive external splines on the turbine splined adapter and there was also non-uniform wear of the splines in the area where the adapter mated with the aft end of the turbine-to-compressor coupling.  When the engine was disassembled, there was a discrepancy noted between the thickness of the shims (used for alignment of the gas producer and power turbine drive trains) on the mounting pad between the exhaust collector support and the accessory gearbox than what had been entered in the engine logbook or what was etched on the exhaust collector support.  In addition, the balance marks on the spur adapter gear shaft and the turbine-to-compressor coupling were not aligned.  According to the Rolls Royce 250-C30 series Overhaul Manual, the balance marks were required to be aligned during re-assembly of the engine.  The Overhaul Manual also stated that the cracks found on the vertical fire shield could have been as a result of \"abnormally high engine vibration.\"",

He requested and received clearance for an intersection departure. After departure, an air traffic controller instructed the pilot to turn left and proceed on course, but the pilot did not respond. Controllers reported observing the airplane initiating a left turn before descending and impacting terrain on the south side of the airport property.Postaccident examinations of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. However, the examinations did reveal propeller signatures consistent with the engine not producing power at the time of impact. About 2 gallons of what appeared to be 100LL aviation fuel was drained from the right fuel tank and about 0.5 gallon of fuel was drained from the left fuel tank at the accident site. The drained fuel was clean, and no water was present. The carburetor fuel bowl was removed, and it contained only a small amount of fuel. The accelerator pump was actuated by hand, and it did not discharge fuel. No fuel leakage was noted at the accident site. Given the amount of fuel removed from the airplane at the accident site and the propeller signatures consistent with a lack of power, it is likely that the loss of engine power resulted from fuel exhaustion.A Boeing 737 (737) airplane departed the parallel runway about 1 minute 45 seconds before the accident airplane departed.

The airplane was not approved for known icing conditions. While en route, the pilot advised air traffic control that the airplane had encountered icing, and requested a lower altitude. The controller approved a descent to the lowest altitude permitted by terrain clearance requirements. After contacting the next en route controller, the pilot again noted icing, and again requested a lower altitude; however, the controller could not approve a further descent due to the same terrain clearance requirements, but authorized a turn. Subsequently, based upon information from another pilot, the controller advised the pilot that he could climb to try to exit the top of the clouds, which the pilot accepted. The airplane began a climb, but the pilot then radioed, \"we're going down.\" When requested by the controller, the pilot confirmed that the airplane was again accumulating ice. Postcrash examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies, and its trajectory through the trees was consistent with a stall/spin.",

Shortly thereafter he said the engine ceased operating. and he made a forced landing to the field. During the landing rollout the airplane incurred damage. An FAA airframe and powerplant mechanic with an inspection authorization rating, who responded to the scene of the accident stated that he found the B-nut on the inlet side of the fuel flow divider loose, about one full turn. In addition he said he saw signatures consistent with a leak which originated at the B-nut and ran down the right front of the engine case. Follow-on examination of the accident airplane revealed that at the connection of the B-nut on the fuel inlet line to the manifold, there was torque putty on the threaded connection on the manifold side, and no putty was observed on the B-nut.

The airplane was operated by Kirst Aviation, Fairbanks, Alaska, as an on-demand sightseeing flight under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135. The commercial pilot and three passengers were seriously injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a VFR flight plan was filed. The flight originated at the Fairbanks International Airport about 1003. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records the pilot earlier that day had filed a VFR flight plan indicating that he intended to depart from Fairbanks, then stop at Bettles, Deadhorse, Barter Island, Alaska, before returning to Fairbanks. He indicated that he had approximately 7 hours and 20 minutes of fuel on-board. The accident occurred during the flight between Bettles and Deadhorse.According to witnesses, just prior to the accident, the airplane was observed flying slowly in a northerly direction, in the vicinity of Antigun pass at low altitude, following the contours of the surrounding terrain \"like he was looking for game.\" The engine could be heard to be \"running strong.\" Moments later the airplane was observed to impact sloping terrain at approximately 4,700 feet above mean sea level on the east side of the Dalton Highway, then slide about 35 feet across the loose rock of the slope.On August 26, 2014 two Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety inspectors from the Fairbanks Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) traveled to the accident scene to examine of the wreckage. The inspectors reported that they were unable to find any preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The FAA safety inspectors reported that the fuselage was twisted, bent, and displayed areas of significant crush and compression damage. The engine was canted approximately ten degrees down from its normal mounted position, both propeller blades had separated from the propeller hub, and the wings were impact damaged.A detailed NTSB wreckage examination is pending following the wreckage recovery. First responders reported that at the time of the accident visibility in the area of the pass was in excess of 10 miles with scattered clouds at approximately 12,000 feet, and the wind out of the northeast at 4 to 7 knots.",

During the circle to land, visual contact with the airport environment was lost and engine power was never increased after the airplane had leveled off. The airplane decelerated and entered an aerodynamic stall, followed by an uncontrolled descent which continued until ground impact. Weather at the time consisted of rain, with ceilings ranging from 300 to 600 feet, and visibility remaining relatively constant at 2.5 miles in fog. Review of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) audio revealed that the pilot had displayed some non professional behavior prior to initiating the approach. Also contained on the CVR were comments by the pilot indicating he planned to descend below the MDA prior to acquiring the airport visually, and would have to execute a circling approach. Moments after stating a circling approach would be needed, the pilot received a sink rate aural warning from the enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS). After several seconds, a series of stall warnings was recorded prior to the airplane impacting terrain. EGPWS data revealed, the airplane had decelerated approximately 75 knots in the last 20 seconds of the flight. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact failures or malfunctions with the airplane or any of its systems. Toxicology testing detected sertraline in the pilot\u2019s kidney and liver.

He chose that specific airport because he thought that its lower elevation would be a better choice than his original planned stop. As was his normal practice at an unfamiliar airport, he opted to perform a touch-and-go practice takeoff and landing. After a normal touchdown, he input full throttle and began the departure. As the airplane passed the end of the runway, it began to lose altitude. Believing that he could not make it back to the runway, the pilot attempted to locate a suitable area to make a forced landing. The airplane could not make it to his selected area and collided with terrain, separating both wings from the fuselage.

Approaching the 79th Street Boat Basin, at 1,500 feet, the pilot heard a \u201cbang\u201d and a passenger asked if the helicopter had hit a bird. The pilot answered no, then heard the \u201cEngine Out\u201d warning and saw that the N2 [power turbine] indication was dropping. The pilot decided to perform an autorotation, and just prior to lowering the collective and rolling the throttle to flight idle, he saw the \u201cEngine Chip\u201d light illuminate. The pilot advised the passengers that they were \u201cgoing down\u201d and transmitted a Mayday call to LaGuardia Tower. During the flare, the pilot deployed the skid-mounted floats and bled off all forward airspeed. Following impact, the chin bubbles broke and water rushed into the cabin.Once the helicopter came to rest, the pilot verified that all of the passengers were safe, confirmed same with LaGuardia Tower, secured all switches and circuit breakers, and helped the passengers to board a boat before boarding another one himself for the trip to shore.According to the responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the turbine section of the Rolls Royce 250-C30P engine had been recently overhauled, and the engine was returned to service with about 2 hours of operation prior to the incident. The inspector also stated that following the incident, the helicopter was transported to JRB, where an initial examination was performed. He further noted that with power applied from the battery, the Engine Chip light illuminated. In addition, the starter would not rotate the engine, the compressor section was difficult to turn by hand, the turbine section rotated freely, and the chip detector was caked with carbon and small metal specks. Fuel samples taken at the helicopter\u2019s last refueling stop were also found to be clear, free of water and \"within specifications.\u201dThe engine was subsequently removed from the helicopter and transported to the overhaul facility where it was further examined under NTSB oversight. During the examination, in the compressor section, the engine number 2 bearing was found to be damaged, and appeared dry with evidence of high temperatures. The corresponding races also appeared dry with evidence of high temperatures. The forward side of the bearing cage exhibited significantly more damage than the aft side, with the forward side bearing cage deformed and the bearing balls on that side appearing rough, with large areas of material loss. To confirm oil flow, the engine gearbox was attached to an oil supply and the engine oil pump was rotated by means of a hand drill. Three of the four jets from the oil supply tube (piccolo tube) produced streams of oil; however, the fourth, which normally supplied oil to the aft face of the number 2 bearing, did not.The piccolo tube, number 2 bearing and several associated parts were retained for further examination.",

The flight included a planned fuel stop at an intermediate airport on the way back to home base.  During the approach, while the helicopter was approximately 100 feet above ground level (AGL), the pilot reported in the Pilot Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) that available engine power continued to decrease while he maintained a constant pitch setting on the approach.  The pilot initiated the immediate action steps of the emergency procedures for a loss of engine power by confirming that the throttle was in the full-open position while lowering the collective to initiate an autorotation.  The pilot was forced to increase collective pitch to avoid power lines which resulted in a decay of rotor RPM to 90 percent available for the landing.  The aircraft touched down tail low while in a decelerating flare and the tail stinger contacted the ground first.  As additional collective pitch was applied to cushion the landing, the pilot leveled the aircraft and landed upright on the intended helipad.  The pilot and his two passengers were uninjured and the helicopter sustained structural damage.  The engine was removed from the helicopter and shipped to the factory for examination and test run.

The certified flight instructor (CFI) said that after turning inbound from the procedure turn during a practice NDB-A approach he idled the left engine to simulate an engine failure.  The student executed the emergency procedures for a simulated engine out approach.  The CFI set the power on the left engine to simulate zero thrust.  The airplane was configured with the landing gear up and the flaps were set at 10 degrees, for an intended circle to land approach to runway 03.  Upon entering the traffic pattern the student was too close to the runway on the downwind leg and overshot the runway and was high turning base to final.  The student pulled the engines to idle, extended the flaps to 25 degrees, lowered the landing gear, and completed the landing checklist.  The CFI called for a go-around and the student applied both throttles forward but the CFI noticed they \"weren't really climbing.\"  The CFI confirmed that both throttles were forward and then retracted the landing gear and the flaps; the airplane was not climbing and the student in the back seat told them to \"watch the airspeed.\"  They pushed the nose forward attempting to maintain the airspeed above 66 knots.  The airplane continued to descend until contacting the ground.  The airplane came to rest in the dirt area between the taxiway and runway 6/24.  Runway 24 was the active runway at the time.  The winds were from 280 degrees at 12 knots, and the density altitude was calculated at 9,080 feet.  The runway selected by the CFI, runway 3, was 3,930 feet long and 60 feet wide; it was not the active runway, and was not equipped with runway lighting.  Post accident examination of the airplane revealed that the left propeller signatures were consistent with rotation at ground impact, but not at a significant power level.  The right propeller signatures were consistent with high power.  After substituting another propeller, the left engine was placed onto a test stand; it started within a few propeller blade revolutions, responded to throttle operation, and ran smoothly without hesitation.  The pilot operating handbook for the airplane calls for the flaps to be raised on both normal and single engine go-arounds; however, a cautionary note says that a loss of altitude may result until a climb is established.  The manufacturer calculated that the airplane should have had a positive climb rate of 90 feet per minute with the gear and flaps retracted and the left engine at zero thrust.",

Despite the available weather information and numerous pilot requests for weather deviations (including before the 757 pilot reported the turbulence), the controller did not advise any pilots of flights under his control of the significant areas of radar-observed precipitation along their routes of flight in accordance with FAA Order 7110, \u201cAir Traffic Control.\u201d Further, the air route traffic control center\u2019s facility support manager for quality control stated that the center had no program to ensure that displayed precipitation information was being provided to flight crews as required; the center has since made several corrective changes, including a remedial training program and performance monitoring, to ensure that weather services are provided to flight crews as required. In addition, if the flight crews had detected the precipitation using the on-board radar and then requested deviations, as necessary, they may have been able to avoid encountering the severe turbulence.",
            "probable_cause": "The air traffic controller\u2019s failure to provide required advisories about significant radar-observed convective precipitation along both airplanes\u2019 flight routes and the air route traffic control center\u2019s lack of a program to ensure that air traffic controllers provide this required information to pilots, which led to both airplanes encountering severe turbulence.\u00a0Contributing to the airplanes\u2019 encounters with severe turbulence was the flight crews\u2019 failure to detect the precipitation using on-board radar and request deviations, as necessary, to avoid the hazard."

During the forced landing, the left wing contacted the ground, and the airplane tumbled through an impact sequence.  During the postaccident engine examination, investigators noted debris and corrosion inside the carburetor and the main jet passage.  The airframe and engine inspection revealed no further mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.  A Safety Board metallurgist examined the carburetor and debris/particles. The examination identified that the debris/particles were most likely a combination of lead and soil that had built up over time.  The corrosion indicated prolonged exposure to water.  The particles probably caused a restricted flow of air-fuel mixture in the main jet that eventually resulted in a reduction or loss of engine power once the particulate contamination had built up to a significant amount.  There were no entries in either the airframe or engine logbook indicating that the carburetor had ever been overhauled in its 46-year history.  The carburetor manufacturer issued a service bulletin regarding the overhaul of the accident airplanes' carburetor.  The recommended time for the overhaul was either at the engine manufacturer's time between overhaul, or every 10 years the carburetor was in service, whichever came first.  While service bulletins are not mandatory, had the carburetor been inspected at the manufacturer's recommended intervals, the corrosion and debris may have been identified and source of the fuel system contamination corrected.  Investigators noted that the airplane had not been equipped with a shoulder harness restraint system.  The fatal injuries for the pilot and front seat passenger were caused by head and upper torso trauma associated with the upper body not being restrained during the impact sequence.  The airplane manufacturer had issued Service Bulletin No. 980, Shoulder Harness Installation, in 1995, for the accident make and model airplane.  The pilot/owner had purchased the shoulder harness restraint system kit for his airplane, but had not installed them.

The pilot was attempting to turn the airplane back for runway 7 when it touched down in a field and then struck a car traveling south on a city street, about a 1/4-mile west of the airport.  A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector responded to the accident site.  He observed witness marks in an adjacent field that he indicated were tire marks from the landing gear of the airplane.  The airplane then traveled in an easterly direction about 350 feet where it impacted and went through a chain link fence, crossed the north bound side of a city street, and collided with a sport utility vehicle (SUV) traveling southbound on the street.  Responding firefighters noted fuel leaking out of the left wing tank and found that the right wing tank was full of fuel.  Subsequent interviews disclosed that multiple individuals manipulated the fuel selector valve in an attempt to staunch the flow of fuel, and the preimpact position of the fuel selector valve could not be reliably determined.  The airframe and engine were subjected to detailed examinations and tests following recovery of the airplane to the airport.  No evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure was found that would explain the loss of engine power.

The captain and the first officer were fatally injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The international cargo flight was operating on an instrument flight rules flight plan between Las Americas International Airport (MDSD), Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and San Juan International Airport (TJSJ), San Juan, Puerto Rico, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135.According to the operator, the accident flight occurred during the return leg of a round trip between TJSJ and MDSD. Prior to the outbound flight, \"normal dispatch requirements were met,\" and the airplane took on fuel at TJSJ for both legs. The airplane departed MDSD on the accident flight at 1936. A review of radio transmission tapes indicated that the crew first contacted the FAA San Juan Combined En route Approach Control (CERAP) facility at 1949, 13 nautical miles west of MELLA intersection at 11,000 feet. At 2002, the crew was told to descend to 7,000 feet at \"pilot's discretion,\" and at 2008, the crew was advised to change frequency to the next CERAP sector controller. The crew subsequently contacted the next controller, \"leaving one one thousand, descending to seven thousand.\" The controller then advised the crew to maintain 3,000 feet, expect the ILS (instrument landing system) approach, proceed direct to the \"TNNER\" fix, and that information \"Tango\" was in effect. After a crewmember read back the information, there were no further transmissions from the airplane. Preliminary radar data revealed that after MELLA, the airplane proceeded toward TJSJ along a heading of about 085 degrees true, crossing the west coast of Puerto Rico just south of the town of Stella. The airplane maintained 11,000 feet until 2007, and had descended to 8,300 feet by 2010:08. It then made a 20-degree turn to the left, and by 2010:13, had descended to 7,300 feet. It subsequently made a 45-degree turn to the right, and had descended to 5,500 feet by 2010:18. There were no additional verifiable altitude positions. Descent calculations between 2010:08 and 2010:13 indicated a rate of descent of about 12,000 feet per minute (fpm), and between 2010:13 and 2010:18, over 21,000 fpm. Preliminary groundspeed calculations indicated about 290 knots.There was no cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder onboard the airplane.Weather, recorded at TJSJ, 33 nm to the east, at 1956, included wind from 170 degrees true at 5 knots, visibility 10 miles, a few clouds at 7,000 feet, and scattered clouds at 10,000 feet.  An NTSB review of radar images at the time of the accident revealed no precipitation in the area. U.S. Naval Observatory data indicated that sunset occurred at 1749 and that the end of civil twilight occurred at 1813.Wreckage was scattered over a large area that included a pasture and the hillsides that partially surrounded it. General dimensions of the wreckage field were about 1,900 feet in length and 600 feet in width at its widest point, oriented toward 178 degrees true. The wreckage field commenced in the vicinity of 18 degrees, 23.07 minutes north latitude, 066 degrees, 35.30 minutes west longitude, with lighter materials, including the airplane's radome. The field narrowed toward its end, with the heavier materials such as the airplane's two engines located close to each other in the vicinity of 18 degrees, 22.77 minutes north latitude, 066 degrees, 35.29 minutes west longitude.There was no impact crater; only airplane remnants scattered throughout the wreckage field. Significant remnants included, from north to south: the upper right cockpit area, and to the left and further south of that, the outboard portion of the left wing. Farther south was the left side of the cockpit, and near that, toward the center of the wreckage field, was the empennage. To the right of the empennage was the right wing, and farther to the south, on the left side of the wreckage field, was the remainder of the left wing. Beyond that, but before the engines, was the airplane's nose section, which included many of the cockpit controls. There was no evidence of an inflight fire or explosion.All three landing gear remained with their respective housings. The right wing was found upside down, with the landing gear extended and the drag brace assemblies locked over center. The main part of the left wing was also found upside down, but with the landing gear retracted and loose in the wheel well. Extending the landing gear by hand revealed housing deformations and tire marks consistent with the gear having been extended in flight. The nose landing gear was found partially extended in the airplane's nose section, which came to rest on its side. When the nose section was rolled upside down, the landing gear fell back into the wheel well. However, when the landing gear was extended by hand, housing deformation and tire marks found were consistent with the landing gear having been extended in flight. The cockpit landing gear handle, which could only be pulled upward, but not moved forward or aft, was found in the \"gear down\" position.There was evidence of fuel in both wings.Although extensive on-site photographs were taken, the size of the wreckage field as well as the muddy terrain and wet weather precluded complete documentation of flight control continuity. The wreckage was recovered and containerized, and is expected to arrive at a storage facility in Houston, Texas, by late January 2014. After its arrival, the investigative team will reconvene to complete the documentation.    ",

            "narrative": "On June 14, 2015, about 1119 central daylight time, a Grumman American Aviation Corporation model AA-5 airplane, N6552L, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain shortly after takeoff from Gillespie County Airport (T82), Fredericksburg, Texas. The private pilot sustained serious injuries and his passenger was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by the pilot. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight that was originating at the time of the accident.According to the pilot's spouse, about 1115, the pilot called her and stated that he and the passenger/mechanic had completed an annual inspection of the airplane and were going on a local flight in the airport traffic pattern. There were no witnesses to the accident. The main wreckage was subsequently located by the property owner about 1245.The wreckage was located in an open pasture with no trees or other obstructions in the general vicinity of the accident site. The wreckage was located along the extended centerline for runway 14, about 1/4 mile from the departure threshold. The aircraft wreckage was orientated on a 350 degree magnetic heading. The airplane had impacted in a nose-down attitude. There was no appreciable wreckage propagation from the point-of-impact. The main wreckage consisted of the entire airframe, including all structural components and flight control surfaces. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit controls to the rudder and elevator surfaces. Flight control continuity for the right aileron was confirmed; however, there was a torque-tube separation for the left aileron that was consistent with impact damage. The wing flaps appeared to be in the fully retracted position. The fuel system contained tank damage and several line separations that were consistent with impact damage. A first responder reported that the cockpit fuel selector was initially found in the RIGHT position and that, during rescue efforts, he turned the fuel selector to the OFF position. There was fluid present in both supply lines to the fuel selector assembly. The outflow line from the fuel selector was found fragmented. The fluid collected from the right tank supply line was consistent in color and odor to 100 low-lead aviation fuel. There was no water or particulate contamination in the sample collected from the right tank supply line. The fluid collected from the left tank supply line contained a mixture of fuel and water contamination. The electric fuel pump, the lowest point in the fuel system, contained a mixture of fuel and water contamination. The fuel pump filter screen was corroded and was partially obstructed by particulate contaminates.The engine remained partially attached to the firewall by its mounts and control cables. Mechanical continuity was confirmed from the engine components to their respective cockpit controls. Internal engine and valve train continuity was confirmed as the engine crankshaft was rotated. Compression and suction were noted on all cylinders in conjunction with crankshaft rotation. The spark plugs were removed and exhibited features consistent with normal engine operation. Both magnetos provided spark on all leads when rotated. There were no obstructions between the air filter housing and the carburetor. The carburetor fuel bowl contained trace amounts of a fluid that was brown/tan in color, had an odor consistent with aviation fuel, and tested positive for water contamination. Several water droplets were observed to drain from the number 2 engine cylinder when the lower spark plug was removed. The propeller remained attached to the engine crankshaft flange. The propeller blades exhibited aft bending, chordwise scratches, and polishing. The postaccident engine examination revealed no evidence of a mechanical failure that would have precluded normal operation.At 1115, the T82 automated surface observing system reported: wind 170 degrees at 7 knots, broken ceilings at 2,100 feet above ground level (agl) and 2,700 feet agl, 10 mile surface visibility; temperature 26 degrees Celsius; dew point 21 degrees Celsius; and an altimeter setting of 29.93 inches of mercury.A handheld GPS device, recovered from the wreckage, recorded an alert message (an interruption of external power) at 1119:38 (hhmm:ss). The handheld GPS device was not configured to record historical position/track data. A second GPS device was recovered from the wreckage and was retained for additional examination. ",

The pilot was flying and the instructor was handling the flaps and coaching the student. Upon touchdown, the tail wheel bounced slightly and the airplane began to drift to the left. The instructor attempted to correct the drift with opposite rudder. The airplane swerved to the right and tilted left. The left wingtip struck the ground and the airplane nosed down.

The flight was cleared to descend from FL 390 to 10,000 feet, and the flight crew established a 4,000-foot/minute descent.  As the airplane descended through FL 219, air traffic control requested the pilot contact approach control.  However, the pilot read back an incorrect frequency and spoke an unintelligible word.  The controller attempted to correct the pilot; however, no additional communications were received from the flight crew.  Located within a pause in the pilot's last transmission, a 1680 Hz frequency could be heard for 0.1 seconds.  There are only two systems in the airplane with aural warning systems within that frequency range; the cabin altitude warning, and the overspeed warning (both systems were destroyed during the accident sequence).  Shortly after the last transmission from the pilot, radar data depicted the airplane climbing back up to FL 231 before entering a steep and rapid descent.  A performance study indicated that just prior to the loss of control, the airplane exceeded its maximum operating airspeed of 300 knots calibrated.  However, according to the manufacturer, the airplane had been successfully flown at airspeeds up to 400 knots calibrated without loss of control.  The right wing and sections of the right horizontal stabilizer/elevator separated from the airplane just prior to its impact with terrain and were located approximately 200-250 feet from the main impact crater.

The private pilot received minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. A witness located at the airport observed the airplane during its initial climb after takeoff. He stated that, at an altitude about 100-200 feet, the airplane made an \"abrupt\" left turn, lost altitude, then pitched to a nose-up attitude. He then observed the airplane lose altitude and pitch up a second time, and stated that the airplane was in an \"aggressive\" nose-up pitch attitude as it sank below the tree line and out of his view. The pilot reported to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that he conducted a preflight inspection of the airplane and observed no anomalies. He then conducted four or five practice touch and go takeoffs and landings in the airport traffic pattern before the accident takeoff. On the accident takeoff, during climbout from runway 6, the airplane's right cabin door opened at an altitude about 400 feet. The pilot attempted to reach across the right seat and close the door, but could not reach it, and stated that the airplane \"did not want to fly.\" The pilot elected to return to the airport or find an open area to conduct a forced landing, and as he turned the airplane left, it experienced an aerodynamic stall and impacted trees. The airplane came to rest upright, in a nose-down attitude among trees about one mile northeast of runway 6 at DKK. Postaccident examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed substantial damage to both left and right wings and the fuselage. The fuel tank sight glasses indicated that each fuel tank was about one-quarter full. Control continuity was established from the cockpit to all flight control surfaces. Impact damage precluded a functional test of the right door latches; however, visual inspection revealed no anomalies.",

Please see the public docket for this accident to view the original report.**The pilot conducted a preflight inspection that included procedures to ensure removal of accumulated water before flight. Due to the cold temperature, the pilot requested an engine pre-heat service, which was applied for an estimated 15 minutes. There were no abnormalities during the engine start, taxi, and engine run-up before takeoff. During the takeoff climb, the pilot reduced power to the cruise/climb setting. At an altitude of about 1,500 feet above ground level, the engine sustained a partial loss of power; the pilot then applied carburetor heat and elected to return to the departure airport. While returning to the airport, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall, impacting the ground adjacent the runway. A postaccident examination did not reveal any discrepancies that would have prevented normal operation of the airplane or its systems.A postaccident examination revealed a chunk of ice with debris frozen in the gascolator fuel bowl; however, the ice chunk was not large enough to block the fuel flow to the engine. Further examination revealed no water in the carburetor. The closest official weather observation station, about 14 miles west of the accident site, reported the temperature as 4 degrees Celsius (C) and the dew point as minus 1 degrees C about 35 minutes after the accident. Based on the ambient temperature and the dew point, serious carburetor icing conditions were possible at cruise power. The airplane's Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), in the cold weather operation section, states that \"appropriate use of carburetor heat is recommended . . . . Full carburetor heat may be required for temperatures below -12 [degrees] C whereas partial heat could be used in temperatures between -12 [degrees] C and 4 [degrees] C . . . . Use the minimum carburetor heat required for smooth operation in take-off, climb, and cruise.\" The investigation determined that the pilot's application of carburetor heat was not consistent with guidance in the POH, and carburetor icing developed because of the pilot's delay in applying carburetor heat.",

The helicopter drifted right as the skid made contact, and the pilot added left cyclic input to remedy the drift as he also lowered the collective. As the skids started to settle apart, the pilot noticed a low frequency vibration that immediately got worse. He determined that the helicopter was entering ground resonance, but the engine and collective parameters were too low to lift the helicopter off of the ground, as indicated in the helicopter's operating procedures. The pilot reduced the throttle to idle and \"within seconds, the helicopter had shaken itself apart.\" Postaccident testing revealed that all four landing gear dampers failed to meet the manufacturer's serviceable testing specifications, and two dampers were overcharged. Maintenance records indicated that the front dampers had been replaced with overhauled units about 10 months and about 534 flight hours before the accident.

As he watched the airplane, the wings rocked violently from side to side, and the nose pitched up and down. As the airplane passed low over hilly, tree-covered terrain, it rolled to the right, the right wing struck a large tree and separated, and the airplane descended behind a stand of trees. Pilots flying in the accident area reported strong wind with significant downdrafts and turbulence. A postaccident examination of the airplane did not disclose any preimpact mechanical malfunctions. Given the lack of mechanical deficiencies and the reports of turbulence and downdrafts, as well as the witness\u2019 account of the airplane\u2019s physical movements, it is likely that the pilot encountered significant terrain-induced turbulence and downdrafts while flying at low altitude. The area surrounding the accident site and portions of the pilot's earlier flight path were bordered by large areas of open and protected water, several of which were suitable for landing the float-equipped airplane.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s decision to continue the flight toward his destination in significant turbulence and downdrafts, and his subsequent failure to maintain control of the airplane while flying low over rising terrain."

The flight returned to the airport and landed without further incident. Examination revealed the threaded shaft of the nose gear steering bungee assembly was fractured, and the damaged component physically restricted the movement of the elevator control assembly. Metallurgical examination of the shaft revealed fatigue fractures in two locations with no evidence of hardness anomaly and no evidence of improper lubrication. Examination of the profile of the thread relief area of the shaft revealed the region was irregular and asymmetric, and a number of machining grooves were of smaller radii than the 0.050-inch radius specified in Cessna technical drawings. The shaft was absent of identifying markings or a part number, and maintenance logs for the airplane revealed no record of repair or replacement of the component. Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Directive (AD) 81-14-06 for the Cessna 172RG requires the replacement of part number 2467003-1 rudder trim/nose gear steering bungee with part number 2467003-6 rudder trim/nose gear steering bungee. Cessna Service Letter SE 80-99 states the new steering bungee part number 2467003-6 \"includes a larger diameter jack screw shaft providing substantially greater unit strength and longer service life.\" Both the AD and the Service Letter are applicable to Cessna 172RG airplanes serial numbers 172RG0001 through 172RG0769.
