The flight's mission was to insert a helicopter fire attack crew at the location of a wildfire.  The landing zone (LZ) closest to the fire was in a small area surrounded by trees.  The density altitude was calculated to be 11,968 feet.  The pilot first landed at a meadow about a mile away and off-loaded two fire fighters, then proceeded to the LZ, and dropped off the one remaining fire fighter and tools.  He returned to the meadow, where he picked up the additional crewmembers.  The flight returned to the landing site, overflew the LZ and continued up the drainage before making a right turn back towards the LZ.  One witness seated in the front left seat noted that on the first takeoff from the meadow the torque gauge was at 100 percent and the helicopter was \"hard to get off the ground\" and the climb out was slow and labored.  On the return flight to the LZ, the first fire fighter dropped at the LZ saw that the helicopter was flying slowly about 20 feet above the tree line.  He believed they would land with the wind; however, the pilot flew the helicopter past the LZ and continued up the drainage.  A surviving witness in the left front seat noted that the torque gauge read 100 percent.  As the pilot initiated the right turn to return the LZ, the torque reading went from 100 to 105 and then 110 percent.  He asked the pilot if the tail rotor was going to stall, but received no response.  The witness noted that the airspeed gauge read zero.  At that point the pilot started to rapidly move the collective, cyclic, and \"his feet.\"  The helicopter then spun two times to the right.  Both a ground witness and a rescue flight crew noted that the LZ had a slope to it and was located in very tight area, with reported winds southwesterly between 2-4 knots.  During the on-scene investigation, investigators noted that the compressor blades in the engine were folded opposite the direction of rotation and that tree fibers had been ingested by the compressor impellor, a condition indicative an operational engine at high power at the time of impact.  The engine teardown revealed that additional tree fibers were found throughout the gas path from the compressor section through to the combustion and exhaust sections.  There were no other discrepancies noted with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain a minimum translational lift airspeed while maneuvering in high density altitude conditions at near maximum required torque and above the in ground effect hover altitude, that resulted in a loss of tail rotor effectiveness and a loss of control.

The airplane landed hard on the left float, bounced into the air, and landed on the right float.  The right wing contacted the water, and the airplane nosed over, coming to rest with the left wing submerged and the right wing pointed into the air.  The three passengers on board released their seatbelts, and exited the right cabin door.  Both the pilot and the right-front seat passenger were unable to locate, release, or cut the pilot's seatbelt.  The pilot was described by one passenger as 'awake, and alert, and fully cognizant of the situation; able to cooperate but unable to complete the task for whatever reason.'  The airplane slowly rolled inverted and remained afloat.  The passengers, and a rescuer from shore, were unable to open the pilot's locked door, or remain submerged in the 40 degree Fahrenheit water.

About 1/2-mile from the airport, a passenger grabbed the left forward doorpost with her hand for support and a 'pop' noise was heard. Immediately, flames shot out from both sides of the plastic doorpost cover at the map light's level and black smoke filled the cockpit.  The pilot tried to smother the fire, but each time the flames came back and seemed to grow more intense.  An emergency downwind landing was made on runway 1 as the flames completely involved the cockpits left side. The cabin was destroyed in the ground fire. It was unclear if AD 80-04-08 was complied with following its issuance on February 16, 1980.  The AD was due to instances of fuel leaks and/or in-flight fires resulting from contact between the map light switch terminals and an adjacent fuel line.  The AD required a one-time visual inspection of the left doorpost area to ensure that the switch and the fuel line were at least 0.50-inch apart. It also required the installation of an insulator cover over the map switch electrical terminals.  Due to a pilot squawk, a mechanic had repaired the map light the day before the accident.  He found a loose wire and reconnected it to the switch.  In questioning, the mechanic first said that there was nothing between the switch and the fuel line, then stated during a second interview that after review of the AD and parts manual diagrams, he definitely had reinstalled the insulator cover over the switch terminals.  Review of the 172's design history revealed that models prior to the 172N had only one fuel supply line from each tank that were routed down the aft doorpost.  Map lights installed prior to the 172N were located at the top of the doorpost in an area with more internal clearance.  With the 172N model change, a second fuel feed line was added from each tank and routed down the forward doorpost in the channel with the wire bundles and the map light switch, with nylon spacers added to physically separate the wires from the fuel line.  Also, the map light and switch were moved to their present locations.  The only flammable components in the doorpost are the wire insulation, the nylon spacers, the plastic doorpost covering, and, the fuel in the fuel line (0.75 psi head pressure at the map light level).  No evidence of electrical shorts in the doorpost circuits or flammable fluid leaks external to the doorpost, which would account for the ignition and severity of the doorpost fire, were found during the investigation.  Three accidents were found in NTSB accident records where fires originated in the left forward doorpost; all three aircraft were Cessna 172N's.  The SDR data base had three instances (only 172N's) where electrical arcs from the map light switch had punctured the fuel line in the left forward doorpost and caused an in-flight fuel leak.  Other SDR's documented over 12 instances where electrical wires had chaffed into the fuel lines in either the left or right forward doorpost areas.  Examination of two exemplar Cessna 172N's revealed that the internal configuration of the doorpost components were not in conformance to original drawing specifications due to interior replacements and repairs over the years. ",
            "probable_cause": "An in-flight fuel fire in the left forward doorpost due to an electrical arc from an adjacent map light switch puncturing a main fuel feed line.  The manufacturer's inadequate design in routing the fuel line in close proximity to electrical arc sources in the doorpost is causal.  A factor in the accident is the probable failure of the doorpost internal component configuration to conform to original design specifications due to aircraft aging issues. "

After the loss of engine power, the pilot reported that his forward visibility was restricted by engine oil on the airplane's windshield. The pilot completed a forced landing to an open field, but the airplane impacted a hedgerow during the landing roll.A postaccident engine disassembly revealed a failure of the gas generator due to a compressor turbine blade separation. The fractured compressor turbine blade released into the engine gas flow path and subsequently impacted adjacent compressor turbine blades and downstream components, which caused the loss of engine power. A metallurgical examination established that the blade had failed in high-cycle fatigue that originated from the blade trailing edge. However, the root cause of the fatigue could not be determined due to secondary damage sustained to the fracture surface. All other mechanical damage to the engine was consistent with collateral damage sustained subsequent to the release of the compressor turbine blade. Engine oil was observed on the downstream side of the power turbine disk; any engine oil that entered the gas flow path at that location would have been discharged through the exhaust ducts and into the outside airstream, and this was likely the source of the engine oil observed on the exterior of the airframe.

The vibrations gradually became more severe until there was a loud bang and the engine seized.  The pilot made a forced landing to a hay field.  Metallurgical examination of the engine revealed the crankshaft had fractured through the crank cheek, between the #5 and #6 cylinder journals as a result of fatigue cracking.  Further examination revealed that the crankshaft was susceptible to early subsurface fatigue failure due to the presence of \"honeycomb\" structure and microcracking.  The mechanical damage was from contact of the connecting rod with the crankshaft thrust faces, and the \"honeycomb\" structure was most likely a result of overheating during the forging process.  The crankshaft had been installed new in the engine in 2001,and two years later was modified with 11:1 compression ratio pistons.  As a result of this and other modifications, engine power was increased by 30 percent.  Due to the fact that these modifications altered the engine's original certification criteria; the engine was re-classified as an experimental.  The serial number of the fractured crankshaft was listed in Lycoming's Mandatory Service Bulletin (SB) 569A, titled Crankshaft Retirement for Certain Lycoming Engines, which recommended the crankshafts be replaced at the first instance the engine crankcase was separated or no later than February 21, 2009.  The SB was generated as a result of several subsurface fatigue failures of similar crankshafts used on higher horsepower engines (greater than 300 HP).  Those crankshafts were subject to Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2002-04-51, which would have required them to be removed before the date of this accident.  Since the engine was classified as experimental, the crankshaft did not have to be removed as a result of this guidance.  The AD and SB were issued as a result of a slight change in the specified composition of the crankshaft material, which was a small vanadium addition intended to lower the tempering temperature and reduce warpage; however, this change increased the susceptibility to \"honeycomb\" and microcracking when slightly over-heated during the forging process.  The \"honeycomb\" and microstructure significantly reduced fatigue properties.  The loss of fatigue life was most pronounced in the higher HP applications, and the experimental modifications made to this engine would have made the crankshaft more susceptible to fatigue fracture.",

The airplane was owned and operated by the airline transport pilot, the sole occupant, who received a minor injury. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local personal flight, which was being conducted in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. A flight plan was not filed. The flight had departed the Tacoma Narrows Airport (TIW), Gig Harbor, Washington, about 1315, with the destination being the Bremerton National Airport (PWT), Bremerton, Washington.In an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, the pilot reported that while circling an area about 10 nautical miles south of the destination airport (PWT), he heard something like a pop in the engine, which was followed by a total loss of engine power. The pilot further reported that he then switched fuel tanks and activated the boost pump, but when he engaged the starter it would not turn the engine over. The pilot subsequently made an emergency landing to a beach spit. During the landing roll the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, which resulted in substantial damage to the rudder.The airplane was recovered to a secured location for further examination.",

While entering the downwind leg, the pilot reduced power and the engine began to run \"rough.\"  After carburetor heat was applied, the pilot advanced the mixture, and throttle with no effect.  The engine began to develop power momentarily, and then, on base leg, the engine power became intermittent.  Realizing the he may not make the landing area, the pilot selected an open field adjacent to the runway; however, he observed obstacles in the field and turned back toward the grass strip.  Subsequently, the airplane impacted small trees and brush, approximately 300 feet short of the intended landing strip, and came to rest within 10 feet from the initial impact point.

The engine was mounted on a test stand, started, and was operated for five minutes, up to 1,700 RPM.  With full throttle applied, the engine RPM did not exceed 1,700 RPM.  During the test run, fuel was observed to be leaking from the mating surface between the carburetor bowl and carburetor upper plate.  The engine was then shut down, and the 4 bolts that retain the carburetor bowl to the upper plate were tightened down approximately 1/4 turn each in an attempt to further compress the gasket and abate the fuel leak.  While tightening the bolts, it was noted that the carburetor was sooted and it appeared that the gasket had some degree of thermal distress.  The engine was then started again.

The private pilot was seriously injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated from Marco Island Airport (MKY), Marco Island, Florida and was destined for Ocala International Airport (OCF), Ocala, Florida. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to preliminary air traffic control (ATC) radar and voice communication information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, the pilot departed from MKY about 1425. The flight proceeded uneventfully, and at 1539, was given a radar vector toward an initial approach fix for the RNAV (GPS) RWY 18 instrument approach to OCF. About 30 seconds later, the airplane began descending from its previously established altitude of 6,000 feet, and at 1540, the pilot advised ATC, \"we've got an engine problem, I see a runway off to my left, what is it?\" The controller then advised the pilot that the airport he was referencing was Inverness Airport (INF), Inverness, Florida. The pilot responded that he believed the airplane would be able to reach its originally intended destination of OCF, and asked to be routed directly there. The controller advised the pilot that INF was located to his 11-o'clock and 5 miles, while OCF was located to his 12-o'clock and 20 miles. The pilot again requested and was provided with a radar vector to OCF.By 1541, the airplane had descended to an altitude of 4,000 feet. About that time, the controller asked the pilot to report the number of persons aboard and the airplane's quantity of fuel remaining. The pilot stated that there was one person onboard, that the airplane had 3 hours of fuel remaining, and \"we've got an engine that's cutting out\u2026\" The controller again offered that INF was located to the pilot's 9-o'clock and 4 miles, to which the pilot responded, \"we're going there now.\" The controller subsequently provided the pilot with the runway orientation at INF, and cleared him for a visual approach. The pilot acknowledged the transmission, and no further communications were received from the pilot. Radar contact with the airplane was lost at 15:43:45, at a reported altitude of 800 feet, about 2 nautical miles north east of the INF runway 19 threshold. The airplane subsequently impacted a residence located about 1 nautical mile southwest of the last radar-observed position, and about 1 nautical mile northeast of the runway 19 threshold.The wreckage was subsequently recovered from the accident site and retained for examination at a later date.",

The airplane made a 'sharp' turn to the left to realign with the runway center, slightly overshot the runway to the left, turned to the right 'sharply,' and touched down on the runway.  The witness further stated, '...by the time the pilot was on the runway he had wasted approximately 1,200 to 1,500 feet of runway 4, they hit reverse thrusters [sic] and were on full bore till they crossed runway 27 and 9.'  The witness saw heat come out of both engine thrust reversers, the nose gear touched down and then came up again.  He then saw the airplane come off the ground about 30 to 40 feet, wobble left and right at a 'slow airspeed,'  crossover a highway at a low altitude, right wing low, strike some wires, go into a field, and catch fire.  The pilot said, when he touched down on the runway, the airplane seemed to 'lurch' to the side.  He said at this point his airspeed was 126 knots.  He elected to abort the landing, and applied full power.  He said the engines would not develop thrust and he elected to land in a field less than 1/4 mile in front of him.  Examination of the left thrust reverser revealed that the translator was in the deployed position, with the blocker doors fully open.

According to Lear Jet and FlightSafety International, the procedures that are taught to Lear Jet pilots in the use of thrust reverse and spoilers during landings are; '...pilots [are] to use thrust reverse only on full stop Lear Jet landings.  Pilot are trained not to deploy spoilers or thrust reverse during touch and go's or during balked landings.'  The pilot-in-command of N19LH at the time of the accident, told the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) that he was 'aware' of the limitations on the Aeronca Thrust Reverser and he knew that once the Thrust Reverser was deployed that he was 'committed' to land.

The 2,475-hour commercial pilot reported that he had set the altimeter to the current barometric pressure setting of 29.75 inches of Mercury prior to departure.  Then, he and the pilot-rated passenger departed and made several passes over the lake at 500 feet, then descended to 300 feet for better visual reference of an object on the water.  The crew still had difficulty identifying the object and the pilot descended to 200 feet.  The pilot reported that there was absolutely no reference to the horizon, so he told the passenger that he would be \"on the instruments.\"  As the pilot made a right hand turn, he said the altimeter indicated a slow descent from 200 feet, so he pulled back slightly on the cyclic and increased collective pitch to start a smooth, climbing right turn.  As the pilot did so, the passenger shouted, \"look out!\"  The pilot pulled the cyclic back sharply and looked out the windscreen.  The pilot thought that he was about to strike a tower because the altimeter indicated an altitude between 150 and 175 feet.  The pilot then saw a \"black wall\" through the windscreen and they collided with the water.  Examination of the altimeter revealed that it was not impact damaged, but did exhibit water and corrosion damage.  It displayed a barometric pressure setting of 29.66 inches of Mercury and an altitude of approximately 110 feet.  Due to corrosion, the unit could not be bench tested.  The face of the instrument was removed, and excessive corrosion was observed inside the unit and around the gears.  The barrel shaft (turn knob) was locked, but it was engaged to the barrel.

About seven minutes after the handoff between Cleveland and Chicago centers, the pilot transmitted, \"Center this is uh 707SH what do you show us in up here?\"  Aircraft and weather radar data showed the accident airplane flew into an area of level six precipitation (extreme weather) prior to a rapid loss of altitude.  Several witnesses reported first hearing the sound of a revving aircraft engine before seeing the airplane descending rapidly in a spiraling descent.  A pilot-rated witness reported that the airplane was in a \"flat spin\" before impacting the terrain.  Before the pilot departed on the accident flight, he was given a weather briefing that indicated his route of flight would take him into areas of thunderstorms, moderate turbulence, and icing.  According to available pilot flight records, the pilot did not have a current biennial flight review and was not instrument current, as required by federal aviation regulations.  No pre-impact anomalies were found with the airplane during the post-accident inspection.\"THIS CASE WAS MODIFIED 11/16/2006.\"",

The departure surface was a grass strip that stretched about 2,000 feet long, with trees located at the end.  The Airplane Flight Manual for the AT-502A states that 10 degrees of flaps should be set for takeoff.  The pilot reported that his takeoff procedure consisted of starting the takeoff roll with the wing flaps in the retracted position until rotation, where he would he would start the initial climb by pulling back on the control stick while simultaneously lowering the flaps to the 10-degree extended position.  The pilot stated that he used this procedure in an effort to decrease the ground roll.  Following his procedure, the pilot applied full engine power and the airplane started the takeoff roll down the grass strip.  As the airplane's groundspeed increased, he moved the flap control to extend the wing flaps and rotated the airplane to a nose high attitude.  The airplane lifted off the grass surface, but the wing flaps failed to extend.  The airplane climbed to about 15 feet, flew down the runway in ground effect, and collided with tree branches, then descended into the terrain.  During an examination of the cockpit, a Federal Aviation Administration inspector observed the flap circuit breaker to be in the \"out\" position.  The airplane's manufacturer stated that applying the wing flaps after starting the departure roll is an improper takeoff procedure.  The manufacturer further stated that the drag created by the wing flaps at 10 degrees is negligible during takeoff roll phase of operation, and keeping them retracted will not decrease the takeoff distance by a measurable amount.

The flight departed, and remained in the traffic pattern.  The approach and landing were normal until during the landing roll, when the airplane pulled sharply to the left.  He brought the airplane to a stop on the runway and advised the control tower  that he and the occupants were safe and they had a braking problem.  One of the occupants who is the president of the facility that had just completed the annual inspection exited the airplane and noted that the left main landing gear torque links were separated and the main landing gear tire was rotated.  The airplane was raised on jacks, the torque links were reconnected, and the airplane was towed to the ramp.  The president of the facility that had just completed the annual inspection of the airplane who was on-board at the time of the incident reported that to him, the approach appeared to be a little \"...short, but it looked ok, due to the storm that was coming in fast he wanted to land before it closed the airport in.\"  The right front seat occupant commented several times that the flight was high and fast.  Full flaps were extended, and the airplane was landed \"...a bit hard to what I'm used to, the pilot said simultaneously when landing that 'the aircraft was pulling to the left like if the brake had locked up.'\"  The right front seat occupant helped to maintain directional control of the airplane until it came to rest.  He got out of the airplane and noted the left main landing gear wheel assembly was rotated 15-20 degrees to the left from the normally installed position, and the upper and lower link assemblies (p/n 5141005-7 and 5141005-9, respectively), were not connected to each other.  Additionally, the upper and lower link assemblies securing bolt, bushing, two AN washers, castellated nut, cotter pin, and clamp securing the flexible hydraulic hose remained installed in the upper link assembly.  He further stated that following recovery of the airplane, a hard landing inspection of the landing gear was performed and no damage was noted.  The airplane was towed to the ramp where the landing gear was repaired before NTSB and FAA could examine the airplane.  NTSB examination of one of the incident washers revealed the outside diameter measured approximately .570 inch, and the thickness was approximately .061 inch.  The specified washer P/N is 5045018-1 (-1), and when exhausted use 5045018-2 (-2).  The outside diameter for the -1 and -2 washers is .750 inch, while the inside diameter for both is .313 inch + .031 inch.  The -1 washer is .032 i nch thick while the -2 washer is .063 inch thick.  Cessna Service Kit SK 421-118 (Service Kit), dated November 23, 1983, calls for installation of a -2 washer under the bolt head and nut that secure the torque links, and inspection of the torque links.  The Service Kit also specifies that washer P/N S1450-5H12-063 will be incorporated into the next Service Kit revision.  The airplane was last inspected on May 16, 2003, in accordance with an annual inspection using 14 CFR Part 43 appendix D, and the \"Inspection Time Limits\" specified in the airplane maintenance manual.  Review of the \"Inspection Time Limits\" guide related to the main landing gear revealed the torque links are inspected for condition and security, then serviced.  Review of the discrepancy sheets for the last annual inspection revealed both main landing gears were removed and installed into another airplane, with the corrective action reading, \"reinstalled right and left main landing gear on N402DD.\"  According to the hour meter, the airplane had been operated for .25 hour at the time of the incident since the annual inspection was completed.  At the time of the incident, Safe Air International, Inc., dba Island Express Airlines was leasing the airplane from the registered owner.  The Director of Operations for Island Express reported that the incident pilot did not have permission to operate the airplane, and he was not a pilot nor employee of Safe Air International, Inc.  He also reported that Island Express did not authorize the test flight and they were first made aware of the test flight after the incident had occurred.  The owner of the airplane reported that 2 days before the incident, a letter was sent from an attorney on his behalf to Island Express advising that he (airplane owner) had taken possession of the incident airplane and the lease was, \"...in default.\"",
            "probable_cause": "The inadequate annual inspection of the airplane by other maintenance personnel for failure to note an incorrect washer was installed securing the upper and lower torque links, resulting in separation of the upper and lower links and subsequent rotation of the landing gear tire during the landing roll."

The pilot was ferrying the airplane on the return flight. A witness reported seeing the airplane in cruise flight when its engine \u201ccut out\u201d and its attitude dipped slightly then leveled; the airplane then nosed over and descended straight down, impacting the ground in a residential yard. Another witness reported that the engine \u201croared loudly\u201d and sped up just before the airplane nosed over. A review of the airplane maintenance records revealed an annotation dated about 4 months before the accident indicating that the pilot had previously performed a precautionary landing due to a rough running engine. The reason for the rough running engine and any repairs made were not found in the airplane records.A postcrash examination of the airplane\u2019s engine showed heavy sooting and contaminants in the carburetor inlet, the inlet side of the carburetor slide, the outlet side of the butterfly valve, and the lower outlet portion of the venturi, which exhibited a distinct washing of the soot. The inlet side of the venturi had minor sooting. The outlet side of the slide was relatively free of sooting but exhibited a varnish or gum-type build-up. The slide was found in the closed position and did not move freely; however, it would move if a prying force was applied to the bottom of the slide. Sooting patterns on the outlet side of the engine components are usually indicative of a leaking intake valve, which could cause blowback of gases into the intake manifold and carburetor. If severe enough, this blowback could result in engine failure. In addition, the build-up observed on the carburetor slide was much more than normal and could have caused the slide to stick open during the accident flight. If the throttle were reduced while the slide was stuck, air flow would be reduced while fuel flow remained high, resulting in a rich mixture that could stop the engine. The engine would again run at full throttle but not at any reduced throttle setting. Although the carburetor slide was found in the closed position, a problem with engine operation would be expected with a slide that does not move freely. Based on the examination of the carburetor and other engine components, it is likely that the engine experienced a loss of power. The witness statements indicating the airplane\u2019s sudden drop in altitude suggest that the pilot\u2019s attention was focused on the engine problem rather than maintaining airplane control, resulting in the airplane entering a rapid descent and impacting terrain.",

Shortly after takeoff, the engine lost power.  Witnesses reported that the airplane cleared utility lines and then pitched nose down, impacting terrain in a nose low attitude.  The passenger stated that she didn't think that the private pilot performed an engine run-up prior to takeoff.  She added that after the engine lost power, the pilot reached down to the lower section of the center column area and turned something.  The fuel selector valve is located on the bottom of the center control column and is operated by manually rotating the selector valve handle to one of the four positions; OFF, LEFT, BOTH, and RIGHT.  The fuel selector valve was found in the left fuel tank position.  Fuel was found in the fuel line immediately upstream of the boost pump, however, no fuel was found between the gascolator and the boost pump.  The airplane had been modified by STC for a Continental IO-550 engine; part of the installation involved installing a 1-quart capacity header tank between the selector and fuel control unit.  The engine was operated on a test stand and no anomalies were noted that would have prevented its operation.  One of the witnesses was also an acquaintance of the pilot and reported that the pilot was in the habit of turning the fuel selector to the off position when the he hangared his aircraft.  This was due to instances in the past in which fuel had leaked on his hangar floor when the fuel selector had not been turned off.  He added that the pilot experienced a loss of engine power while taxiing in the past due to the fuel selector being in the off position.  The Preflight Inspection, Before Starting Engine, and Before Takeoff checklists instruct the pilot to place the fuel selector valve in the on or both position.  Toxicological tests on the pilot were positive for paroxetine, and  verapamil.  Paroxetine is a prescription antidepressant drug and verapamil is a prescription medication for high blood pressure.  The paroxetine is not approved by the FAA for use during flight; however current medical literature shows the drug does not appear to have adverse performance effects when taken in therapeutic dosages.  The subtle effects of higher than normal doses have not been systematically investigated, though symptoms of over dosages have been reported to include sedation and dizziness.  The pilot did not report the use of the aforementioned medications on his last application for an airman medical certificate.",
            "probable_cause": "the loss of engine power resulting from fuel starvation due to the pilot's inadequate pre-flight inspection, inadequate performance of the pre-takeoff checklist, and failure to ensure that the fuel selector was properly positioned prior to takeoff.

Shortly after reaching cruise altitude the pilot reported that he was \"having trouble holding altitude,\" descended to 15,000 feet msl, reported \"engine problems,\" and then reported \"instrument problems.\" The pilot subsequently requested to divert to Chattanooga-Lovell Field (CHA), Chattanooga, Tennessee. At 1513, the pilot reported that the airplane \"lost engine power\" and the corresponding radar return was approximately 7 miles north of FGU and indicated an altitude of 6,000 feet msl. Then the pilot reported \"oil all over the windshield\" and that he \"could not see a thing.\" Subsequently the pilot reported \"I cannot see it. I cannot make it. I am just looking for anything at this point\" and that a forced landing was imminent.\" The last recorded radar transponder return for the flight was about 2 nautical miles north of FGU and in the vicinity of the accident location.The airplane was located in a grassy area of an industrial park. The airplane came to rest on its belly and the landing gear was retracted. The initial impact point was denoted as a ground scar created by the left wing of the airplane and the main wreckage came to rest 108 feet 8 inches from the initial impact ground scar. The nose of the airplane impacted the ground 16 feet 4 inches from the initial impact point and began with a ground scar similar in shape and dimension as the propeller flange. The debris field was on a 202 degree heading from the initial ground scar and the airplane came to rest on a 015 heading. Subsequent examination of the surrounding area revealed a composite piece of the tail was located about 510 feet and on a magnetic heading of 036 degrees from the initial impact sight.Examination of security video, obtained from a nearby facility, revealed that the airplane impacted the ground in a left wing down, slightly inverted attitude. Subsequently, the nose of the airplane impacted the ground, followed by the right wing. The security video further revealed a mist emanating from the wreckage similar in appearance to fuel spray from the breeched right fuel tank.The airplane exhibited various degrees of impact and crush damage and the empennage, aft of the most aft bulkhead, was separated, but remained in the immediate vicinity of the main wreckage. Both wings exhibited impact damage on the outboard approximate one-half of each wing. Rudder cable continuity was confirmed from both sets of rudder pedals to the rudder horn located in the tail through the cable cut that was made to facilitate recovery. However, the rudder was separated from the vertical stabilizer at the attach points during the accident sequence, and was located in the immediate vicinity of the stabilizer. Elevator push/pull tube continuity was confirmed from both side mounted control columns in the cockpit to the base of the vertical stabilizer mounting surface on the aft bulkhead. The elevator operated smoothly on the separated vertical stabilizer. Left aileron continuity was confirmed from the side mounted control columns in the cockpit to the left wing's fracture point on the outboard section of the wing; however, the aileron was impact separated but was in the vicinity of the wreckage. Right aileron continuity was confirmed from the side mounted control columns to the push/pull tube fracture point at the fuselage wall and from that fracture point to the aileron. Examination of the engine revealed that the propeller flange remained in place; however, the propeller had not been not located at the time of this writing. The propeller flange bolt holes were devoid of any bolts or bolt shanks and the holes were packed with soil from the nose impact point.",

The pilot attempted to perform an autorotative landing but landed hard, causing substantial damage to the helicopter.Postaccident inspection of the engine revealed one airfoil of the fourth-stage power turbine wheel fractured near the hub due to high-cycle fatigue that initiated on the pressure side of the airfoil at the trailing edge. No surface defects were noted along the root filet radius adjacent to the fracture initiation region. The enhanced fourth-stage power turbine wheel  was manufactured in October 2006, installed into the turbine assembly, operated for 1,769 hours, then removed for a 1,750-hour inspection. The fourth-stage power turbine wheel remained installed in the turbine assembly at the completion of the inspection, and the turbine assembly was reinstalled onto the engine. At the time of failure, the wheel had accumulated approximately 2,690 hours since new and approximately 921 hours since the last 1,750-hour inspection was performed.Since 2005, there have been four other fatigue failures of an airfoil of an enhanced fourth-stage turbine wheel. All other failures initiated at the trailing edge near the hub. In December 2006, Rolls-Royce developed an engine alert bulletin (CEB-A-1400) alerting owners and operators of the accident make and model engine to avoid steady state N2 speed between 75 to 88 percent above 85 shaft horsepower (shp). Additionally, Rolls-Royce reported that their research of failures of airfoils of the fourth stage power turbine revealed the possibility of a higher stress state in the airfoil at the trailing edge root than originally modeled. The stress, which occurs during engine start, results from thermal differentials in the airfoil geometry that produce a residual stress at the trailing edge root that can lead to a fatigue crack. Once a crack occurs, it can propagate in high-cycle fatigue followed by overload failure if the engine is operated in a steady state in the N2 speed avoidance range (75 to 88 percent N2) above 85 shp, as specified in CEB-A-1400.",
