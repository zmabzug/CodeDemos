After talking to the witness, the pilot taxied back to the runway and resumed the taxi tests.  The witness reported that after completing a number of passes down the runway, he observed the airplane takeoff.  He reported that the airplane appeared to be porpoising as it ascended over the runway.  Additional witnesses reported that they observed the airplane in a climbing right turn over the airport.  The airplane climbed to about 200-300 above ground level (AGL) and appeared to be in a modified downwind for runway 25.  The witnesses reported that as the pilot turned from right base to final, the airplane abruptly pitched nose down (approximately 60 degrees).  The witnesses reported that the airplane momentarily returned to a level flight attitude, but pitched down a second time just before impacting terrain in a nose low attitude.  Maintenance records indicated that the airplane was issued a special airworthiness certificate, experimental category, on April 23, 2003.  The accident flight was the airplanes first flight subsequent to receiving the airworthiness certificate.

The controller stated that he must remain at or below 500 feet and that a frequency change was approved upon reaching a local geographical reporting point (Century Boulevard). A review of radar data disclosed that the helicopter followed an interstate southbound toward the destination airport. The radar data further showed that about 3 minutes prior to the last target, the helicopter's altitude varied between 200 and 400 feet mean sea level (msl). The last target was observed at a mode C reported altitude of 400 feet msl (about 250 feet above ground level), and located adjacent to Century Boulevard.

On the day of the accident the pilot was planning on doing a test run of the recently overhauled engine. Witnesses reported that the pilot ran the engine for about five minutes and then shut it down. Then, about fifteen minutes later, he started the engine again and taxied out to the active runway. Without performing a magneto or carburetor heat check, the pilot pulled onto the runway and added what sounded to witnesses like full power. The airplane then made a \"very short\" takeoff roll before lifting off. Although the liftoff appeared normal to the witnesses, soon thereafter the nose of the airplane pitched up to a near-vertical attitude. It then climbed to an altitude of between 150 to 200 feet above ground level. Then, with the engine still at what sounded like full power, the airplane slowed, fell off on the right wing, and descended near vertically into the grass-covered terrain near the side of the runway. A postaccident teardown inspection found that the elevator control cables had been connected to the incorrect elevator control horns, resulting in a reversal of control inputs at the elevator. A mechanic who had signed off many of the pilot's previous rebuild projects stated that he had found reversed control cables on two other airplanes the pilot had completed. The mechanic also stated that the pilot had done \"high speed taxi tests\" on a number of other rebuilt airplanes prior to the time they were inspected and signed off. The mechanic had warned the pilot about the dangers of doing so, but the pilot had continued the practice.Toxicology testing of specimens from the pilot was consistent with the recent use of a medication containing diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter impairing antihistamine. Family members described a 10-year history of a skin condition consistent with chronic urticaria (hives) that resulted in severe recurrent itching and which had frequently occurred while the pilot was working on aircraft. The pilot had not indicated any conditions or medication use at the time of his last Application for Airman Medical Certificate, less than 5 months prior to the accident. Although the pilot likely would have had no opportunity to recover the aircraft once it became airborne, it is possible that impairment from the use of diphenhydramine or distraction from chronic urticaria contributed to the pilot\u2019s failure to correctly rig the elevator cables. However, the investigation could not determine whether impairment or distraction played a role in the accident.",

The airplane was being operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country positioning flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulation Part 91. Instrument meteorological conditions (IFR) were reported in the area at the time of the accident, and the solo pilot received fatal injuries.  The airplane departed Lemhi County Airport (KSMN), Salmon, Idaho, bound for Ravalli County Airport, Hamilton, Montana, about 1640.During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on June 18, the owner of the airplane said that the airplane was being repositioned to the Ravalli County Airport for the summer. The airplane arrived at the Dillon Airport (KDLN), Dillon Montana on Monday, June 16, but was unable to continue to Hamilton due to weather. The owner said the pilot was told to remain in Dillon until the weather cleared. The pilot told the owner that he might fly to Salmon the following morning and check the weather along the highway to Hamilton. The owner asked the pilot to telephone him before he departed. The owner said he did not receive a telephone call from the pilot.During a telephone conversation with the NTSB IIC on June 18, a witness at the Dillon Airport said he had spoken with the pilot after he arrived in Dillon. They talked about weather and routes. The witness said the following morning the airplane departed about 0830, but returned a short time later due to weather. He said the airplane remained in Dillon the rest of the day, and about 1630 the pilot said he'd probably be back in 30 minutes, and departed. The witness did not see the airplane again.  A Ravalli County Sheriff's representative told the IIC that he had spoken to a witness at the Lemhi County Airport who told him the airplane had stopped there, before departing northbound along highway 93 toward Hamilton. A witness living along highway 93, about the 4,000 foot elevation level, said he had seen the airplane northbound headed toward the mountain pass in the direction of Hamilton. The witness is a pilot and said he had flown the route many times. He said although the airplane was in VFR conditions, and appeared to be at an altitude of about 6,500 feet when he saw it; the pass is higher, and appeared to be obscured. He further stated he could see what he thought was a thunderstorm developing to the west and moving east toward the pass.The highway 93 mountain pass is just over 7,000 feet in elevation. Located at the summit are a visitor center and the base of operations for a ski area; including a lodge and parking lot.  An employee at the visitor center told the Sheriff's representative that the airplane arrived over her position at a very low altitude, just above the trees, and that it was snowing, and the visibility was about \u00bc mile at the time. She said she saw the airplane \"spin around\" 6 to 7 times descending vertically before it impacted the ground in the parking lot of the ski area.  Upon impact, the airplane burst into flames, initial responders were not able to approach the wreckage due to the intense heat and flame.On June 18, the airplane was examined at the accident site by the NTSB IIC, accompanied by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air safety inspector.

As the manifold pressure dropped below 21 inches, the pilot increased the throttle; however, the manifold pressure continued to decrease until the needle reached the lowest reading on the gauge. The pilot exercised the throttle through its full range, but received no response from the engine.  He then executed a forced landing to a muddy field. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the throttle cable had separated. The cable was examined at the NTSB Materials Laboratory and it was determined that the cable failed as result of fatigue cracking. The outer coiled spring housing, in which fatigue was observed, had a coarse texture and contained tool marks and surface fissures.  The origin of the fatigue was observed at one of the fissures.

The friend was speaking with the pilot on the telephone when he observed the airplane drop rapidly about 1,000 feet as it was flying toward his house. The airplane was maneuvering very low in a nose-high configuration with full power, flying fast through the slight valley about 75 feet above ground level (agl). He noted that the winds were from the east (providing a tailwind) and estimated they were about 40 miles per hour (mph). The friend heard the telephone drop, with the pilot making a few inaudible comments. The airplane than made a rapid ascent as it neared power lines, climbing in a near vertical nose-high maneuver to about 1,000 feet agl. It subsequently made a 90-degree pivot about the longitudinal axis and then continued to turn into a barrel roll, disappearing behind the tree line. Ground scar analysis, impact signatures, and wreckage fragmentation patterns disclosed that the airplane impacted terrain in a near level attitude, with high forward velocity. The impact geometry combined with the witness statements of observing the airplane roll immediately after a near-vertical climb, is consistent with the pilot recovering from an accelerated stall and subsequent roll just prior to impact. There was no evidence of a pre-mishap mechanical malfunction or failure observed during the examination of the engine or airframe. A pilot report in the immediate vicinity and prior to the accident reported continuous light to occasional moderate turbulence between 2,000 and 5,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The GOES-11 satellite imagery surrounding the period depicted orographic clouds over and downwind of the higher terrain and 5 minutes after the accident, showed a band of tubular or \"arcus\" clouds moving over the accident site, which were similar in appearance to roll clouds. The clouds were of short duration and had moved southeastward and became less distinct about 15 minutes thereafter. Additionally, the Vandenburg AFB soundings surrounding the accident time indicated a strong low-level temperature inversion with northerly winds favorable for mountain wave activity formation downstream from high terrain.  Based on an analysis of the terrain, wind flow pattern, and potential arcus clouds over the area, it is likely the accident aircraft encountered moderate or greater turbulence and downdrafts during the flyby of the residence.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's encounter with isolated moderate (or greater) turbulence, updrafts, and downdrafts associated with localized mountain wave conditions at low altitude, and, his failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the encounter that resulted in an inadvertent accelerated stall.  Contributing to the accident were the pilot's decision to conduct low altitude flight maneuver and the pilot's diverted attention while using a cell phone. "

The helicopter was flying along the edge of a fjord, adjacent to steep terrain.  About 2,200 feet msl, the engine lost power, and the pilot entered an autorotation.  The pilot selected an emergency landing area at the rocky edge of the fjord.  During the autorotation, the pilot pulled the manual activation handle to deploy the emergency floats, but they did not deploy. The pilot did not use the electrical emergency float deployment switch.  Postaccident examination of the helicopter's emergency float system disclosed that the manual activation cable was improperly rigged.  The pilot landed the helicopter in the water, on a rocky shelf.  The pilot and passengers exited the helicopter into waist-deep water and gathered on the rocks.  The helicopter remained upright for a short time, but then sank.  The pilot reported that the helicopter was fueled before his departure, and the fuel quantity was 50 to 55 percent at takeoff.  When the pilot departed the glacier on the accident flight, he said the fuel quantity was 30 to 35 percent.  The flight from the glacier to the operator's base should have taken about 20 minutes.  The pilot reported that the operator records a total daily use of fuel for its fleet of helicopters, but does not maintain individual fuel records for each helicopter.  After the helicopter's recovery, an examination revealed that the fuel tank contained about 32 percent fluid.  The fluid was sea water, except for about 1.5 quarts of fuel.  Fuel was found in the airframe fuel filter, and in the fuel line from the filter to the engine fuel control.  The fuel tank has an internal, resistor type fuel probe which incorporates a float, and a low fuel level position, which when reached, should illuminate a low fuel annunciator.  The fuel tank incorporates a vent tube at the top of the tank to allow atmospheric air pressure to enter the tank.  The operator had marked fuel quantity level lines on the exterior of the tank depicting fuel level, and percent of fuel at each line.  A postaccident examination of the engine revealed no mechanical abnormality.  A functional test of the fuel probe was not completed due to damage received in the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power during cruise flight for an undetermined reason, which resulted in a ditching and submersion of the helicopter when the emergency float system did not deploy.  Factors contributing to the accident were improper rigging of the mechanical activation mechanism for the emergency floats by company maintenance personnel, and the failure of the pilot to utilize the electrical firing system to activate the emergency floats."

The floor of the radar coverage in the area was about 200 feet agl. The accident site was located at an elevation of about 2,293 feet mean sea level (msl) on the slope of a bowl-shaped box canyon about 25 nautical miles (nm) from the departure airport.

The airplanes responded to traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) advisories, and both controllers immediately provided traffic advisories and turned each aircraft to resolve the conflict. According to recorded radar data, the three airplanes passed within approximately 0 feet vertically and .38 miles laterally from each other.  The air traffic data controller, who was the coordinator between two radar controllers, told the controller working the 777 to stop the airplane at flight level (FL) 210. Following that coordination and while still on an open line with that controller, the data controller leaned toward the controller working the two-C17s and told him to stop his flight at FL220. The controller working the 777 overheard the portion of the communication where the data controller said to stop at FL220 and believed that the instruction was meant for the 777. Therefore, the controller instructed the 777 to climb to FL220, while at the same time the controller instructed the C17s to descend to FL220. Additionally, the investigation revealed that the radar data blocks for each of the airplanes displayed incorrect assigned altitude data. The data block for the 777 indicated that the airplane was cleared to climb to FL230 and the data block for the C17s indicated that the flights were cleared to descent to 10,000 feet.

On the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, the airplane experienced a loss of engine power, and during the ensuing forced landing, it impacted homes in a residential area. No distress calls were received from the airplane. During recovery of the airplane, approximately 18 to 20 gallons of fuel was drained from the right wing and only a residual amount of fuel was drained from the left wing. No visual evidence of fuel contamination was noted. The fuel selector valve was positioned to the right tank, and the auxiliary fuel boost pump switch was found in the \"HI\" position. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal evidence of any discrepancies that would have prevented normal operation. According to the airplane's Owner's Manual, the fuel boost pump should be switched to \"HI\" when switching from an empty fuel tank to a tank containing fuel. Apparently the pilot departed with the fuel selector positioned to the almost empty left tank and the engine lost power as a likely result of fuel starvation. The pilot then attempted to restart the engine by switching fuel tanks and turning the fuel boost pump on \"HI.\" The pilot was unable to restart the engine before the airplane impacted the houses. Toxicological testing revealed evidence that the pilot had been taking two different prescription antidepressant medications, bupropion and fluoxetine.  Fluoxetine was detected at higher than expected levels in the pilots blood, though it could not be determined if this was due to ingestion of higher than normal amounts of the medication.  In typical doses, neither medication would be expected to result in significant impairment, though bupropion is associated with an increased risk of seizure activity, and impairment from the condition for which the medications were prescribed could not be excluded.  Neither medication is typically approved by the FAA for use by pilots, and the pilot did not have a current FAA medical certificate. ",

About one minute later, the co-pilot indicated to the pilot-in-command (PIC) that the airplane was losing airspeed, and about 15 seconds later, the co-pilot remarked \"keep it up, keep it up.\"  Shortly thereafter, the airplane departed controlled flight and impacted terrain.  The airplane was destroyed by fire and impact forces.  Examination of the left engine revealed no evidence of any pre-impact failures that would have accounted for an uncommanded in-flight shut-down.  A SIGMET for potential severe clear icing was effective for airplane's flight path; however, the flight crew did not report or discuss any weather related problems around the time of the accident.  At the time of the accident, the airplane was above its single-engine service ceiling.  The PIC had accumulated approximately 6,000 hours of total flight experience, of which, about 500 hours were as PIC in make and model.

Timmerman Airport (MWC), Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The airline transport pilot and his passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was registered to Trustey Management Corporation and was operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 while on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight that departed Beverly Municipal Airport (BVY), Beverly, Massachusetts, at 1552 eastern daylight time.According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control (ATC) data, the flight had been cleared for a visual approach to runway 33R (4,103 feet by 75 feet, asphalt). At 1808:12 (hhmm:ss), while on a 2.5 mile final approach, the pilot asked the tower controller for the current wind conditions. At 1808:18, the tower controller told the pilot that the prevailing wind was from 230 degrees at 10 knots. At 1808:21, the pilot replied \"Three zero one zero, thanks, or two three zero?\" At 1808:24, the tower controller stated \"Two three, two thirty.\"In a postaccident interview, the tower controller reported that he established visual contact with the accident airplane when it was on a 3 mile final approach to runway 33R. The tower controller stated that the airplane's landing gear appeared to be extended during final approach and that the airplane landed within the runway's marked touchdown zone. The tower controller stated that the airplane did not appear to bounce upon landing; however, he heard a squealing noise that was longer in duration than typical. Shortly after the landing the pilot transmitted \"Go-Around.\" (According to an ATC audio recording, the pilot transmitted \"Go-Around\" at 1809:56) The tower controller stated that he acknowledged the aborted landing and cleared the pilot to enter a left traffic pattern. The tower controller stated that he heard the engine speed accelerate and observed the airplane maintain a level attitude over the runway until it passed the taxiway charley intersection. He then observed the airplane pitch-up and enter a climbing left turn. The tower controller stated that the airplane appeared to \"stall\" during the climbing left turn and subsequently descended into terrain while in a left wing low attitude.A postaccident examination of the runway revealed numerous slash marks that were consistent with propeller blades striking the asphalt surface. The first propeller strike was identified about 1,384 feet from the runway 33R threshold. There were 22 propeller strike marks identified over a distance of about 25 feet 7 inches. The propeller strike marks were located slightly to the right of the runway centerline. There were numerous small asphalt pieces found adjacent to the slash markings.The main wreckage was located in an open field located on the west side of the airport property. The initial impact was identified by a small ground depression that contained pieces of red lens material that were consistent with the left wing navigational light. A large area of burnt ground and vegetation preceded the main wreckage. The wreckage debris path was oriented on a 180-degree heading and measured about 141 feet long. The propeller, nose landing gear, right flap, and left aileron were located along the wreckage debris path. The main wreckage consisted of the fuselage, empennage, both wings, and the engine. The main wreckage was oriented on a north heading. A majority of the fuselage, including the cockpit and cabin, and the left wing were consumed by the postimpact fire. The cockpit Garmin G1000 avionic components, including the nonvolatile memory cards, were destroyed by the postimpact fire. Flight control continuity could not be established due to impact and fire damage; however, all observed separations were consistent with overstress or were consumed during the postimpact fire. The landing gear selector switch was found in the GEAR DOWN position. Measurements of the landing gear actuators were consistent with all three landing gear being fully extended at the time of impact. Examination of the nose wheel tire and right main tire did not reveal any flat spots. The right main and nose wheel assemblies rotated freely and no anomalies were noted with the right brake components. A majority of the left main tire had been consumed during the postimpact fire. The four fuselage skid plates, installed on the lower wing spar carry-through structure, did not exhibit any evidence of scraping damage. The lower VHF antenna had separated from the fuselage and was located along the wreckage debris path. The lower VHF antenna did not exhibit any evidence of scraping damage. The trailing edge of the right flap and the corresponding flap track fairings did not exhibit any evidence of scraping damage. The left flap was partially consumed during the postimpact fire. Measurements of the flap actuator jack screws were consistent with the flaps in the landing configuration (34-degrees).The propeller assembly and the forward section of the reduction gearbox had separated from the engine and were found along the wreckage debris path. All four propeller blades remained attached to the hub assembly and exhibited S-shape bends, tip curls, chordwise scratching, and leading edge damage. The fractured propeller shaft exhibited features consistent with torsional overload. The engine exhaust exhibited evidence of torsional bending associated with impact. The downstream face of the compressor turbine disc and blades exhibited rotational scoring from contact with the adjacent static components. The upstream face of the compressor turbine disc and blades were unremarkable. The first-stage power turbine vane and baffle exhibited rub marks on both sides from contact with the power turbine and compressor turbine discs and blades. The first-stage power turbine disc and blades exhibited rotational scoring on the upstream face. Examination of the engine oil filter and magnetic chip detectors did not reveal any significant particulate contamination. The observed damage to the propeller and engine components were consistent with the engine operating at a medium-to-high power output at the time of impact.",

The purpose of the flights was to provide recurrent training for pilots scheduled to conduct fire-fighting operations for the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) during the upcoming fire season.  Pilots aboard the airplane during the earlier flights reported no mechanical problems with the airplane.  As was the mission for other flights that day, the accident flight, the tenth flight, was a training flight to conduct practice drops of water over an area of rugged mountainous terrain located north of the airport.  Aboard the flight were the captain, the copilot, and the company's Chief Pilot, who was providing flight instruction. The Chief Pilot had been on board all the flights that day.  Radar data indicated that the flight departed the airport and proceeded about 10.5 nautical miles to the north where it began maneuvering in a manner consistent with the conduct of practice water drops.  The data showed  the airplane entering and then following a right-hand racetrack pattern oriented northeast-southwest, during which it appeared that practice drops were being made on the southwest leg.  During the last minute of the flight, the airplane was on the northeast leg of the racetrack pattern, flying up a valley that was oriented northeast-southwest with uphill being to the northeast.  The airplane's flight path was initially near the middle of the valley.  During the last 36 seconds of the flight, the airplane's flight path began to deviate towards the rising terrain on the eastern side of the valley.  The last two radar hits show the airplane at an altitude of less than 100 feet above ground level.  The airplane had completed approximately 1.75 circuits of the racetrack when the data ended with the airplane at 2,900 feet msl, heading northeast.  The initial impact point was located about 2,150 feet northwest of the last radar data point at an elevation of about 2,450 feet msl, indicating the airplane entered a left descending turn and completed about 90 degrees of turn between the last radar hit and the impact.  No distress calls were received from the airplane.  According to local authorities, witnesses observed a \"fire ball\" at the time of the accident.  Examination of the wreckage site revealed that the airplane impacted on about a 304 degree magnetic heading in a 40 degree left bank with the left wingtip striking the ground first.  The airplane was severely fragmented and a severe post crash fire burned most of the structure and surrounding vegetation.  Remnants of the entire airplane were accounted for at the wreckage site.  There was no evidence of pre-existing structural failures or impact with foreign objects in any of the wreckage.  All four of the engines and propellers were found at the wreckage site.  The engines did not have any indications of an uncontainment, case rupture, or pre-impact in-flight fire.  All four engines had damage to the compressor and/or turbine rotors that was consistent with engine operation.  The cockpit engine instrumentation gages indicate that all four engines were running at about 2,200 shaft horsepower at impact.  Review of the airplane's maintenance records did not reveal any chronic issues with the airplane nor any system/component anomalies that would have contributed to the accident.  The airplane was equipped with neither a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) nor a flight data recorder (FDR) and Federal Aviation Regulations did not require the airplane to be so equipped.  The reason for the in-flight collision with terrain could not be determined.",

Following an uneventful engine run up, the pilot taxied onto the runway and observed the windsock shift direction momentarily to indicate about a 90 degree crosswind, and then realign with the runway. The pilot initiated the takeoff roll, and the airplane lifted off normally. During the initial climb, the pilot scanned all of the flight instruments, noting a positive climb rate. Shortly thereafter, the airplane encountered a wind gust from the left, rolling the airplane about 90 degrees to the right. The pilot leveled the wings and felt the airplane descending. Despite the pilot's attempts to arrest the descent, the airplane continued to descend. Subsequently, the airplane struck several small trees and impacted the ground.

The auto throttle and autopilot were disengaged during the approach, about 800 feet agl.  However, the auto throttle reengaged just prior to touchdown, about 35 feet agl.  The flightcrew did not recall reengaging the auto throttle, and were not aware of the autothrottle reengagement.  According to the auto throttle computers, the reengagement was commanded through one of the Engage/Disengage paddle switches located on each power lever.  The target airspeed set for the auto throttle system was 138 knots.  After touchdown, as the airplane decelerated below 138 knots, the auto throttle system gradually increased the power levers in an attempt to maintain the target airspeed.  Without the power levers in the idle position, the ground spoilers and thrust reversers would not deploy.

The student pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which was destined for Farmville Regional Airport (FVX), Farmville, Virginia. The instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The owner of the flight school that operated the airplane stated that the student was departing on his first solo cross-country flight when the accident occurred. After reviewing his preflight planning and assisting him in a preflight inspection of the airplane and engine run-up check, she observed as the pilot taxied to the terminal to obtain fuel. The pilot then performed a second engine run-up and departed from runway 08. She stated that the takeoff appeared normal, but that the pilot appeared to initiate a left turn to the crosswind leg of the traffic pattern earlier than was customary. As the airplane turned left, she watched as its nose pitched upward before it rolled sharply left and descended to ground contact. Two pilot-rated witnesses located on the north side of the airport observed the airplane during the takeoff. They remarked to each other that it appeared \"abnormally slow\" and stated that it did not seem to be gaining altitude. Both individuals also reported viewing a thin trail of \"smoke\" or \"brown exhaust\" from the airplane's engine. The witnesses observed the airplane make a sharp left turn and descend steeply to ground contact. One of the witnesses reported that the winds were light and variable from the north and east. The pilot held a student pilot certificate and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) third-class medical certificate, which was issued on January 20, 2015. Review of the pilot's logbook revealed that he had accumulated 30.6 total hours of flight experience, of which about 18 hours were in the accident airplane, and 2.7 hours were solo.  The 0935 weather observation at OMH included wind from 040 degrees at 3 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear skies, temperature 0 degrees C, dew point -12 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.41 inches of mercury. The airplane came to rest upright in a field located about 1,330 feet northeast of the departure end of runway 08, with the wreckage oriented on a heading of about 170 degrees magnetic. The initial impact point was identified by a ground scar about 30 feet south of the main wreckage that contained pieces of the left wing navigation light. Areas of disturbed soil extended north from the initial impact point about 15 feet toward a large impact crater about 6 feet in length and 3 feet in width, which contained pieces of the propeller spinner and ground scars consistent with propeller contact. The propeller remained attached to the crankshaft flange and one blade exhibited slight forward bending. Both blades displayed chordwise scratching and leading edge gouging. The engine remained attached to the fuselage by its bottom mounts. The fuselage displayed significant aft crushing from the engine firewall to the rear cabin seats, and was displaced to the left just aft of the baggage area. Both left and right wings displayed significant aft crushing of their leading edges. The left wing was separated from the fuselage at its root and the fuel tank was breached. Residual fuel was found inside, and the fuel tank cap was in place and secure. The left aileron remained attached at its hinge points. Control continuity was established from the aileron to the cockpit area through cable breaks at the wing root that displayed signatures consistent with overstress failure.  The right wing remained attached to the fuselage at its root. The outboard approximate 4 feet was bent upward about 45 degrees. The right fuel tank was breached and leaking fuel; the right fuel tank cap was in place and secure. The right aileron remained attached at its hinge points and control continuity was established from the aileron to the cockpit area. The wing flaps were fully retracted. The empennage was intact and displayed minor impact damage. The rudder remained attached to the vertical stabilizer at its hinge points, and the stabilator remained attached at its mounting blocks. Rudder and stabilator control continuity was established to the cockpit area. The windscreen and left cabin window were destroyed upon impact and pieces of each were distributed along the wreckage path and around the main wreckage. Examination of the wings, empennage, and windscreen pieces did not reveal any evidence of a bird strike. The engine crankshaft was rotated by hand at the propeller hub and continuity of the valve and powertrains was confirmed. The spark plugs were removed and displayed black carbon fouling. Thumb compression was obtained on all cylinders, and borescope examination of the cylinders revealed no anomalies. The carburetor inlet screen was absent of debris. The carburetor was removed and the bowl was opened. The floats were intact, and the bowl contained fuel consistent with the color and odor of 100 low lead aviation fuel and was absent of contamination. The magnetos remained secured to their mounts, and were removed and actuated by hand. Each magneto produced spark at all of its terminal leads. ",

The first officer turned off the windshield heat and the flames went out, but the smoke persisted. The captain declared an emergency with air traffic controllers and returned to the Asheville Regional Airport. Examination of the windshield found that the overheat damage was the result of an improperly installed fastener that resulted in arcing between the terminal block lug, the aircraft wiring eyelet and the fastener and lock washer that secures the two components together. The arcing progressed over time degrading the solder junction between the terminal block and the windshield heating system braid wire that resulted in heat damage to the sealant and the subsequent flame.",

One of the passengers had been on an organ recipient waiting list and his wife was accompanying him. A viable matched organ was available at a distant hospital and the passenger had to arrive on short notice for surgery the following morning. All radio communications during the flight between the pilot and air traffic control (ATC), a flight service station (FSS), and a fixed-based operator (FBO) were routine. The pilot was aware of the weather at the destination airport, and had commented to ATC about 75 miles from the destination that the weather was \"going up and down\u2026like a real thin fog layer.\u201d Additionally, better weather conditions prevailed at nearby suitable airports. The pilot mentioned one of those airports to ATC in the event he decided to divert.  According to an employee at an FBO located at the destination airport, the pilot contacted him via radio and asked about the current weather conditions. The employee replied that the visibility was low due to fog and that he could not see the terminal lights from the FBO. The pilot then asked which of the two alternate airports was closer and the employee stated that he did not know. The employee then heard the pilot \u201cclick\u201d the runway lights and contact the local FSS. About 5 miles from runway 29, just prior to the initial approach fix, the pilot radioed on the common traffic advisory frequency and reported a 5-mile final leg for runway 29. The FSS reported that the current weather was automated showing an indefinite ceiling of 100 feet vertical visibility and 1/4 mile visibility in fog. The pilot acknowledged the weather information. The weather was below the minimum published requirements for the instrument-landing-system (ILS) approach at the destination airport. Radar data showed that the flight intercepted and tracked the localizer, then intercepted the glideslope about 1 minute later. There were a few radar targets without altitude data due to intermittent Mode C transponder returns. The last recorded radar target with altitude indicated the airplane was at 600 feet, on glideslope and heading for the approach; however, the three subsequent and final targets did not show altitude information. The last recorded radar target was about 1.4 miles from the runway threshold. The airplane flew below glideslope and impacted 100-foot-tall trees about 4,150 feet from the runway 29 threshold.  On-ground facility checks and a postaccident flight check of the ILS runway 29 approach conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration did not reveal malfunctions with the ILS. The cabin and cockpit area, including the NAV/COMM/APP, equipment were consumed by a postimpact fire which precluded viable component testing. Detailed examination of the wreckage that was not consumed by fire did not reveal preimpact mechanical malfunctions that may have contributed to the accident. Given that the pilot was aware of the weather conditions before and during the approach, it is possible that the pilot\u2019s goal of expeditiously transporting a patient to a hospital for an organ transplant may have affected his decision to initiate and continue an instrument approach while the weather conditions were below the published minimum requirements for the approach.",

Approximately 2,000 - 2,500 feet agl, the flight instructor reduced power on the right engine to a zero-thrust setting.  After maneuvering the airplane for 4-5 minutes, the instructor shut down the engine and feathered the propeller.  After performing single engine maneuvers for about 5 minutes, the student attempted to restart the right engine \"per the published procedure,\" which included unfeathering the propeller, but was unsuccessful.

When the airplane was 500-700 feet agl, the flight instructor took over the controls, and told the student that they were going to land in a field below.  The flight instructor set up an approach to the field, and deployed the landing gear and 25-degrees flaps.  While on the short-final leg of the approach, the airplane hit the tops of some trees bordering the field, then impacted the ground.  A post-accident inspection of the left and right engines revealed no mechanical anomalies.
