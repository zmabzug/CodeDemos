Because the airplane had not been flown for about nine months, the pilot drained all of the old fuel out of the airplane and refueled it. Witnesses reported that the pilot performed an extensive engine run up that lasted 10 to 15 minutes, and with satisfactory results, the pilot decided to take the airplane around the airport traffic pattern. A witness based at the airport said that during the initial takeoff, the engine sound was smooth. As it continued, the witness heard the engine running rough. When the airplane flew past the witness about 300 feet above the runway, the witness saw two puffs of white smoke. The airplane appeared to have adequate airspeed and it was still climbing, although the engine was cutting out. The engine then cut out completely and the airplane continued straight ahead for about 1 second. The airplane entered a slow turn to the right, and when it had turned approximately 160 degrees, the right wing stalled and the airplane rolled into a spin. The airplane went out of view of the witness in a nose-down attitude of approximately 70 degrees. A friend of the pilot who was based at the airport said that when departing to the north as the pilot had done, there are limited options available for emergency landings. The fuel valve was found in the closed, or \"off\", position.  Based on the length of the engine run up, the fuel selector was undoubtedly positioned correctly at takeoff and was most likely moved to the closed position by the pilot when he determined that a forced landing was inevitable. Post accident examination of the wreckage did not disclose any pre-impact mechanical anomalies. Due to damage sustained to the carburetor, no functional testing could be performed.",
            "probable_cause": "The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. Contributing to the accident were the lack of a suitable landing area and the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed while maneuvering in response to the loss of engine power."

With limited time to troubleshoot, the pilot turned on the auxiliary fuel pump; the engine did not respond, and he performed a forced landing short of the runway.\u000b\u000bThe pilot intended to land at the airport to refuel. The left fuel tank quantity indicator gauge was inoperative, so he could not provide an accurate assessment of its quantity. The left fuel tank was selected during the entire approach sequence, and although 10 gallons of fuel were present in that tank after the accident, it had been breached, so an accurate assessment of the quantity before the accident could not be made.

The wing access panel, outboard of the APU plug receptacle in the engine exhaust trail area was found not sealed, as was the flap bell crank bolt access panel also located in the engine exhaust trail area.  The battery positive cable was an automotive type cable.  The relay end of the cable had melted.  The battery ground lead had numerous broken wire strands at the battery end terminal.  The fuel pump resistor and wire bundle from the left wing were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, D.C., in an attempt to determine if they were the source of ignition.  Examination of the wires revealed they were sooted and displayed heat damage consistent with exposure to a fire.  Most of the insulation on the individual wires were missing, exposing the conductors.  Where the insulation was present, the insulation varied in condition from slightly sooted to completely charred and crumbling.  The inspection of  individual wires with a stereo microscope revealed, the copper conductors were heat damaged but remained intact.  No indication of arcing or electrical shorting were found on the wire surfaces.  No determination of an ignition source, for the ground fire, was determined. ",

The flight returned without further incident.  After the prior flight the reverser was unlocked but not deployed.  The flightcrew found the reverser unlock light during preflight.  The crew could not clear the indication and contract maintenance was contacted to lock out the reverser.  The contractor was not familiar and asked for the procedure to be faxed to him.  The contractor used an incomplete set of procedures to lock out the reverser.  Post incident inspection revealed the thrust reverser doors had over deployed.  Four locking pins and their fork shaped locking triggers showed nicks and gouges on their mating surfaces.  Subsequently Boeing revised their dispatch guide to include that maintenance would have to verify that \"no more than one Thrust Reverser Proximity Sensor indicates Open\" and that operators verify that the thrust reverser unlock indication is not present and red lockout pins are present on the inoperative reverser.  Subsequent to the incident the overcenter links were redesigned.  Boeing and the thrust reverser manufacturer issued service bulletins (SB) to retrofit the existing engines with the new link's design change, the link's associated hardware, and rub plates.  Airplanes in production will incorporate the SB items as a production change. Boeing's SB 717-78-004 stated, \"Operators have reported five instances of thrust reversers failing to deploy and ten instances of side beam gouging.  Inspections revealed that gouging had occurred between the over center link bolts and side beam assembly.  One recent event resulted in a relatively new thrust reverser having side beam gouging so deep, it required a doubler to restore airworthiness.  Rohr Incorporated Service Bulletin R715.78-008 provides instructions to modify the thrust reverser actuation system.  The purpose of modifying the thrust reverser actuation system is to minimize the possibility of gouging and inadvertent in-flight thrust reverser deployment procedures given in this service bulletin.\"",

Additionally, the pilot reportedly carried a fully charged 12-volt battery and an electrically operated artificial horizon with him on the accident flight as the agricultural airplane did not have an artificial horizon installed.  The day before the accident, the pilot fueled the hopper tank, and a lineservice person filled both wing fuel tanks.  There was no record that the pilot obtained a preflight weather briefing either through an FAA Automated Flight Service Station, or through the DUAT vendors.  The flight departed at 0727, and after takeoff air traffic control communications were transferred from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Air Traffic Control Tower to the Fort Lauderdale International Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower.  The flight remained in contact with that facility from 0731:00 to 0732:10.  The next recorded air traffic control communications occurred at 0852:30, when the pilot contacted Nassau Approach Control advising that the flight was at 1,500 feet and 40 miles northwest of Nassau, en route from Fort Lauderdale, to St. Croix.  The controller provided the pilot a discrete transponder code, then radar identified the flight advising the pilot that the flight was 35 miles west of Nassau.  The pilot then advised the controller that he would be maintaining 1,500 feet, to which the controller advised the flight would not be able to proceed overhead due to the altitude flown, and provided a heading to fly until the flight was abeam Nassau.  After that time, the pilot could proceed on-course.  At 0928:03, the controller advised the pilot of the altitude and location of traffic, and to, \"...resume normal navigation to your destination.\"  The pilot acknowledged that comment and the controller terminated radar services at 0932:58.  There were no further contacts reported with any ATC facilities along the route of flight.  According to the controller who handled the communications with the accident pilot, the flight was vectored about 10 nautical miles southwest of Nassau for traffic and weather.  The flight was then vectored approximately 20 miles to the southeast of Nassau, where radar services were terminated, the airplane was clear of traffic and weather, and the airplane was proceeding southeast bound.  The Nassau radar data is not recorded; therefore, a radar plot is not available.  Review of the chronological notes from the U.S. Coast Guard, revealed the Coast Guard (CG) was first notified of the missing airplane by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), on September 8, 2002, at 1420.  The CG initiated a communications search and also performed a track line search on September 12, 2002, from the last known position to Providenciales.  The results were negative.  According to the NTSB Weather Study, at the time of the last known position located approximately 20 nautical miles southeast of Nassau (0932), an infrared satellite image indicates a band of high clouds with embedded cumulonimbus clouds extending south of a line from Ft. Lauderdale, and Nassau, southeastward towards the Virgin Islands.  The last known position was located on the leading edge of higher cloud cover with tops to 38,000 feet.  Additionally, enhanced cloud developement with tops to 44,000 feet was noted at a point located 38 miles south of the last known position.  According to the pilot's daughter, her father was ferrying the airplane for the new owner to Brazil.  She reported that her father had on-board a GPS, a 4 man life raft, and a life jacket that he always wore.  He also had a survival kit and a satellite cellular phone, which was tested the day before the accident.

He observed the fuel in the left tank to be level with a point about 2 inches from the outboard vertical wall, along the bottom surface of the tank, which he estimated was 7-8 gallons.  The pilot then flew a 30 minute flight stopping at Sandusky, Ohio, to pick up a passenger.  During the second takeoff under dark night conditions, the pilot told the passenger to expect the engine to quit because he planned to run the fuel out of the left tank, and save the right tank for the approach. About 10 minutes after takeoff the engine quit.  The pilot switched tanks and the engine restarted for a few minutes, and then quit again while the aircraft was climbing through 7,700 feet.  The pilot performed a forced landing noticing wires in his flight path and 'dove sharply to avoid them' without success.  The airplane struck a lower set of wires on approach to a field.  Examination of the wreckage revealed the left and right fuel tanks were intact and contained about 1/2 quart of fuel each.  The airplane's useable fuel capacity was 48 gallons, and according to range charts, the engine's fuel consumption rate was 8.1 gallons per hour at 70% power.  The airplane had been flown about 5.91 hours since its last refueling. ",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to refuel the aircraft resulting in fuel exhaustion, and his unsuccessful attempt to clear the wires.  Contributing factors were the pilot's inadequate preflight, dark night conditions, and the wires. "

The pilots indicated that after touchdown the right wing started to drop, and the CFI took the controls, but the airplane veered off of the runway. Before the pilots left the airplane, they both saw the landing gear activation switch in the retracted position. During the recovery of the airplane, the landing gear was extended, retracted, and then extended again. No damage to the landing gear locking mechanism was found. The safety officer of the flight academy interviewed the flight crew and the recovery personnel.

The collision occurred about 4,800 feet mean sea level (msl) (2,800 feet above ground level (agl)) on the northeast side of runway 12 abeam the approach end.  Both aircraft had made multiple flights taking jumpers aloft prior to the accident.  The Pilatus departed runway 12 about 5 minutes prior to the Cessna's departure on the same runway.  The drop zone was on the airport west of the intersections of runways 12 and 03.  The Pilatus departed to the south and began a climb to the jump altitude of 5,500 feet msl, which was 3,500 feet agl.  The pilot began the jump run on the southwest side of the runway paralleling it on a heading of about 300 degrees and when he was 1 to 2 minutes from the drop zone broadcast the intent to drop jumpers.  The first jumper stated that it normally took him between 1 minute and 1 minute 15 seconds to reach the ground.  As he neared the ground he observed everyone running toward the crash site.  The Cessna pilot had four jumpers on board and said that his usual practice is to plan his climb so that the jump altitude (5,000 to 5,500 feet msl) is reached about the same time that the aircraft arrives over the jump zone.  He departed runway 12 and made a wide sweeping right turn around the airport to set up for the jump.  As the Pilatus neared the jump zone the Cessna was greater than 1,000 feet lower and west of the Pilatus climbing on a northerly heading.  The Cessna pilot planned to make a right turn to parallel the left side of runway 12, and then turn right toward the drop zone.  The jumpers in the Cessna looked out of the right side, and watched the Golden Knights exit their airplane.  The jumpers said that their altimeters read 2,500 feet agl.  The Cessna pilot turned to a heading of 120 degrees along the left side of the approach end of runway 12.  He heard the Pilatus pilot say on Common Traffic Advisory Frequency that the Pilatus was downwind for runway 12.  Based on witness observations, at this point the Pilatus was in a descending turn heading generally opposite to the downwind heading on the northeast side of the runway.  Everyone in the Cessna heard a loud bang, the Cessna pilot felt something hit him in the head, and the airplane pitched down and lost several hundred feet of altitude.  He noticed a blur of yellow and white out of his left window.  The lead jumper decided that they should exit, and they all jumped.  The Cessna pilot decided that the airplane was controllable, and landed safely.  Both civilian and military witnesses on the ground heard the Pilatus pilot call downwind for runway 12.  About 10 seconds later they heard intense transmissions over the loud speaker, and looked up and observed the Pilatus in a nearly vertical, nose down slow spiral.  There was an open gash in the top of the Cessna's cabin on the left side near the wing root.  The green lens and its gold attachment fitting from the Pilatus were on the floor behind the pilot's seat.",
            "probable_cause": "the failure of both pilots to maintain an adequate visual lookout.  The failure of the Pilatus pilot to report his proper position was a factor."

The pilot in command reported that with the autopilot engaged, the airplane started a gentle roll to the right.  The autopilot was disengaged and a approximate 40 degree control wheel deflection to the left was made to keep the wings level.  The right aileron did not seem to move with control wheel deflection.  The right roll control spoiler did respond to control wheel inputs.  All left control surfaces appeared to function normally.  The pilots consulted all control malfunction checklists, and there were no changes noted.  The pilots decided to continue to the destination.  An uneventful, full-flap landing was made at Rapid City Municipal Airport.  Maintenance personnel discovered a completely broken right outboard aileron cable.  The right aileron cable (Part Number 6260106-25) underwent a metallurgical examination.  The wire stands displayed sheared and cut ends due to pinching as if the cable came off its large diameter pulley and was pulled over a small radius and pinched.  Only a few tensile cup cone fractures were found, indicating nearly all the wire strands had been sheared or cut prior to final tensile separation of the few remaining strands.",

During the climb, he applied right rudder, but the right rudder pedal assembly broke off, allowing the pedal full travel to the back of the hopper tank. The pilot was able to return to the airfield and make an uneventful landing, but during the landing roll, the airplane began to turn left, and the pilot had no way to correct since the right rudder, right brake, and right tailwheel steering were not operable. The airplane then exited the left side of the runway and entered a soybean field, causing the right main landing gear to collapse and the right wing to impact the ground and sustain substantial damage. Postaccident examination of the rudder pedal assembly revealed the right rudder pedal arm had separated from its mounting location on the right rudder bar. Both were constructed of steel tubing. The external surfaces of the right rudder pedal arm exhibited areas with disbonded topcoat paint and exposed steel with minor surface corrosion. Internally, the right rudder pedal arm exhibited heavy rust scaling over all surfaces and rust scale that had sloughed from the surfaces had collected at the base of the right rudder pedal arm, where it attached to the right rudder bar. Although measurements of the tube wall's thickness at the top of the rudder pedal arm appeared to be full thickness, with measurements of 0.054 inch, 0.053 inch, 0.056 inch, and 0.055 inch (measured at 90 degree intervals around the circumference), measurements of the tube wall's thickness at the point of the fracture were only 0.030 inch at the thickest point and 0.013 at the thinnest point. The airplane was equipped with a liquid dispersal system, including a hopper tank located immediately forward of the cockpit. Remnants of corrosion product had adhered to silicone plugs that were at the top of the rudder pedal arm tubing, indicating that the corrosion product was present before the application of the silicone sealant. The plugs had likely been inserted in an attempt to keep contaminants (chemicals from the hopper tank and water from cleaning) out of the rudder pedal arms. Review of the Service Manual and Illustrated Parts Catalog revealed that the manufacturer had published inspection criteria for the airplane based on operating usage and operating environment. The criteria provided mandatory inspection intervals for components and airplane structures. The manufacturer also offered a supplemental Corrosion Prevention and Control Program to help prevent or control corrosion in the airplane's primary structure so that it did not cause a risk to continued airworthiness as the airplane aged.

The construction project was under the direction of the Alaska Energy Authority, a State of Alaska corporation.  The State of Alaska construction project manager reported the electrical wires were energized, and the wires were configured to de-energize if shorted.  The pilot had extensive external load experience, but had about 1 hour in the accident helicopter make and model.  He said he was not aware the electrical wires were energized.  The chief pilot was occupying the right seat, and said he was providing 'guidance' during the flight.  The chief pilot said he was aware the wires were hot.  Just after the long line was hooked to a load of steel beams on the ground, the cable touched the overhead electrical wire, and electrocuted one ground member standing on the load.  The construction project operations manager said that the electrical short, caused when the cable touched the wire, was insufficient to trip the electrical power off.  The helicopter company's external load manual includes the following:  'The chief pilot will brief all involved personnel concerning procedures for each operation; the flight crew consists (normally) of one pilot; the use of a hand signalman, separate from the ground crew, shall be assigned no other duties during the operation; the pilot may elect to use a continuous visual observation method, wherein he is directly observing the load by looking out the window, out the door, or by use of mirrors.  In this case, release and/or signalmen need not be utilized.'  The manual also includes:  'Radio contact between the pilot and the hook-up man is highly desirable, and the presence of a radioman in no way alleviates the need for the hand signalman.  A signalman should be present at all times in the event of a radio failure.  If the pilot is able to observe the hook-up operation by using a skid-mounted mirror, and VHF two-way radio communications are maintained between the pilot and the hook-up man, a signalman is not required.'  During the accident, direct radio communication between the ground crew and the pilot was not maintained, and a signalman was not utilized. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain sufficient distance from a transmission wire, arcing of the transmission wire, the failure of company personnel to utilize a nonconducting cable, and an inadequate procedure utilized by the construction project manager to ensure adequate fault protection on an energized transmission wire.  Factors in the accident were a failure of the helicopter operator to maintain sufficient standards, including flight and ground crew coordination, and a failure to maintain radio communication between the pilot and ground crew.

The flight was conducted in an area where normal wind conditions brought trade winds that produced strong updrafts when they encountered the accident site ridgeline.  On the day of the accident, the winds were described as shifty and gusting and they did not produce the updraft along the ridgeline that was most common in that area.  In addition, the cloud bases would not allow for a tow greater than 2,000 feet.  A witness (also a glider pilot), observed the accident glider eastbound about 400 to 500 feet above the ridge.  She then noticed the glider \"turn right (toward the ridge) and its nose come up slightly.\"  The glider turned \"approximately 45 degrees to the right, then turned back to the left and immediately entered a spin to the left.\"  The witness reported that the glider rotated twice before it entered a second spin to the right.  Post-accident examination of the glider revealed no anomalies that would have prevented its normal operation.  A video recording of the flight revealed no anomalies with the glider.  As captured during the final moments of an audio recording of the flight, the pilot's last transmission indicated that the glider was encountering a sink rate.  According to the accident glider's flight manual, after spin entry, the pilot might experience one nose up and down oscillation before the stable spin occurs.  The rotations are relatively slow with an altitude loss of approximately 300 feet per turn.  Recovery technique was normal, except that considerably more control was needed to stop the rotation and to lower the nose.  Instead of easing off back pressure on the stick, it must be pushed forward of neutral and instead of neutralizing the rudder, opposite rudder must be applied.  The rotation could be stopped in 1/4 to 1/2 turn.  Review of the pilot's training records and experience brought into serious question the quality of both.  In less than 3 months after beginning flight training the pilot obtained his commercial pilot certificate, just 2 days after passing his private pilot check ride.  Upon obtaining his commercial pilot certificate the pilot began conducting tour flights for fare-paying passengers;  at this point his total flight experience amounted to 48.4 hours of flight time, of which 31.2 hours were as pilot-in-command.  Review of the pilot's training records revealed he received stall/spin training on the same day he received training on a myriad of complex subjects.  The operator said that when he conducted spin training with the pilot, on one occasion the pilot didn't get the control stick forward enough on a spin recovery and got into a secondary stall.  The operator then had the pilot demonstrate two additional spin/spin recovery maneuvers.  Federal Aviation Regulations indicated that an applicant may obtain their commercial glider certificate with as little as 25 hours of flight time and 100 flights as pilot-in-command.  According to the Soaring Society of America and the Soaring Safety Foundation, it is unusual to obtain a commercial glider pilot certificate in as little time as the accident pilot, and it usually takes about 6 months to 1 year to obtain the required experience.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed while maneuvering during a scenic flight, which led to an inadvertent stall/spin and secondary stall/spin encounter.  Contributing factors were the pilot's lack of total flight experience, his inadequate flight training, and the unfavorable wind conditions."

The airplane had come to rest on an embankment with the left main landing gear extended and intact, resting on the right wing tip. Both engines had separated from the wings with the right engine lying in front of the right wing and the left engine lying under the left wing. During recovery operations, the airplane was placed on a trailer in a level attitude, 7 gallons of fuel was drained from each inboard fuel tank, and no fuel was drained from the outboard fuel tanks. A total of 14 gallons of fuel was drained from the airplane. Both engines were examined, and at the conclusion of their examinations, no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction was found. Review of fueling records revealed that at the beginning of the accident flight, the airplane had approximatley 11 gallons of fuel in each inboard fuel tank, for a total of 22 gallons. The unusable fuel was 3 gallons for each inboard fuel tank. The pilot had intended to fly to an airport located approximately 30 miles south, and each engine consumed approximately 24 gallons-per-hour. The airplane flight manual was reviewed for low fuel procedures/limitations, and the following was found. The shape of the wing fuel tanks is such that in certain maneuvers the fuel may move away from the tank outlet. If the outlet is uncovered, the fuel flow will be interrupted and a temporary loss of power may result. Normal and running turning takeoffs are not to be made when the inboard tanks are less the one-quarter full as fuel flow interruption may occur.

A little more than 2 minutes later the pilot declared a missed approach and was given radar vectors for a second ILS approach. After turning inbound on the localizer the pilot was advised that the runway visual range was 600 feet, midfield 800 feet, and roll out 800 feet. The pilot was then cleared to land. When the tower controller observed the airplane turning to the south of the runway on her radar display, she issued missed approach instructions, which was followed by an inaudible transmission. There were no further transmissions from the pilot. The airplane impacted the top of an 85-foot tall tree with its right wingtip, 3,200 feet southeast of the approach end of the runway, then continued on the collision course before impacting the ground about 845 feet from the initial impact point with the tree. The airplane was subsequently consumed by fire. The weather minimums for the approach required a ceiling of 200 feet and an RVR of 1,800 feet or one-half mile; the decision altitude was 224 feet msl. The FAA published missed approach procedure instructed the pilot to climb to 900 feet, then climbing right turn to 4,000 feet, intercept the 160 degree radial of the VORTAC, and proceed to a DME fix and hold. The airplane's turn to the southeast was consistent with the missed approach course of 160 degrees; however, a climb to 900 feet is required prior to commencing the right turn, as outlined on approach plate's missed approach instructions. It appears the pilot likely misinterpreted the missed approach instructions by making the right hand turn prior to initiating a climb to 900 feet, which resulted in the subsequent impact with the tree. No preimpact anomalies were found during an examination of the airframe and engine. The airplane's avionics components revealed that they were too thermally and impact-damaged to provide any data. No anomalies were found during a post accident examination of the instrument landing system components.",

About 7 minutes later, the pilot reported that he needed to descend because he was \u201cgetting into too many clouds.\" The approach controller approved the VFR descent and instructed the pilot to maintain VFR at or below 2,000 feet. About 6 minutes later, radar data were lost. Recorded radar track data indicated that the helicopter was on a northwest heading and then turned west, that the helicopter's altitude varied between 1,100 to 1,300 feet above ground level, and that the helicopter appeared to be in a right turn before impact. The helicopter impacted trees near the top of a ridgeline located about 0.3 mile west of the Ohio River at an elevation of about 700 feet. The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, located about 13 nautical miles northeast of the accident site, reported 4 miles visibility, haze, and scattered clouds at 1,100 feet. Witnesses reported dense ground fog along the river and on the ridgeline near the accident site at the time of the accident. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Based on the pilot\u2019s inexperience, the radar data, and the reduced visibility at the time of the accident, it is likely that the he experienced spatial disorientation, which led to his failure to maintain clearance from the terrain.",

The commercial/student pilot was practicing a 180-degree autorotation with a power recovery when an excessive rate of descent developed.  The flight instructor said he \"joined\" the student on the controls and initiated a progressive rollout of the turn while simultaneously applying aft cyclic, raising the collective, and applying more power for a power recovery to level flight.  The instructor said that the engine did not respond to the throttle input.  Due to the rate of descent, the flight instructor elected not to attempt an \"aggressive\" flare \"fearing a tail rotor ground strike.\"  He continued with aft cyclic input and collective manipulation to reduce forward airspeed and rate of descent for a run-on landing.  The helicopter contacted the ground in a \"near skids level attitude\" approximately 30 knots, with the rotor rpm in the \"high end of the green region.\"  The helicopter became airborne approximately 8-10 feet above the ground.  The flight instructor indicated that the throttle was still unresponsive.  He raised the collective to cushion the second impact and the low rotor rpm warning light and horn came on prior to set down.  The helicopter impacted the ground again approximately 20 knots, collapsing the left skid.  The helicopter then rolled to the left and came to rest on its left side facing approximately 180 degrees from the approach heading.

Although the engine continued to operate at a maximum of 900-1,100 revolutions per minute (rpm), insufficient power was available to maintain altitude. The pilot contacted the tower of a nearby airport, but determined that he would not be able to reach the runway. Due to power lines and a blind curve on a paved road, the pilot opted to land adjacent to the road. The airplane impacted a ditch and came to rest inverted. The engine had been overhauled 2.0 flight hours before the accident. A field overhaul had been performed on the engine due to a bent pushrod, stuck valve, and broken lifter for the number 3 cylinder. During the field overhaul, all four of the rocker arms had been magnetic particle inspected. Examination of the engine revealed that the number 3 cylinder exhaust rocker arm had separated into two pieces. A metallurgical examination was performed on the rocker arms by a Safety Board metallurgist. The number 3 exhaust rocker arm had fractured around the central pivot hole due to fatigue. The fatigue originated at the outer surface of the oil hole. The corners of the hole were sharp and had not been deburred, which increases the likelihood of fatigue cracking. The outer surface of the fatigued area was 0.31 inches long on the left side of the oil hole, and 0.21 inches long on the right side. The fractured exhaust rocker arm had been magnetic particle inspected for cracks during the field overhaul. The Safety Board metallurgist also noted staining on the cracks from the solution used during the magnetic particle inspection.

He attempted to stretch his glide to avoid buildings and cars on the ground; however, the helicopter struck railroad tracks next to the field boundary. Damage to the main rotor blades was consistent with a low rotor rpm at impact.  The pilot did not recall how much time had elapsed since his last refueling.  Examination of the navigation and fuel endurance log from the helicopter cockpit (required by the operator) showed the pilot had not completed the fuel endurance calculations at the time of last fueling.  The helicopter was equipped with a main fuel system and an auxiliary fuel system.  A deferred maintenance item, 'main fuel gauge unreliable in forward flight,' was still open.  The same discrepancy had also been entered previously and it, too, had not been cleared.  The auxiliary fuel gauge was entered as inoperative on the deferred maintenance log with 'parts on order' but had not been cleared at the time of the accident.  The pilot last recalled reading approximately 78 pounds on the main fuel gauge.  He did not recall seeing the 20-minute light illuminate before the accident.  A check of the low fuel warning system found that float arm contact in the fuel cell occurred at 34 pounds, which approximates 20 minutes of usable fuel; no discrepancies were found in the operation of the system.  No evidence of a fuel spill was found around or under the wreckage.  The crashworthy main fuel cell was uncompromised and about 12 ounces of trapped fuel was found.  No fuel was found in the auxiliary fuel tank.  The light bulbs for the 'Engine Out, Fuel Low, and Master Caution' were removed for examination.  One 'Master Caution' bulb showed a small amount of filament stretching, consistent with hot stretching from a light to moderate impact force.  The filaments of both 'Fuel Low' bulbs were intact and unstretched, consistent with bulbs not being illuminated during a light to moderate impact.

He flew over the airport at 7,500 feet to check the wind T, which indicated runway 11 was the preferred landing runway.  His flight guide specified right-hand traffic for runway 11.  The pilot entered the right traffic pattern on a 45 degree entry for runway 11.  After turning on right downwind he heard the mike \"keyed\" several times.  Because of this, he felt another airplane might be in the area.  He extended his downwind leg, looking for the other airplane.  He did not see or hear any other airplanes.  He then proceeded to turn right base and then final.  The pilot saw the runway lights and began a standard descent.

The pilot stated that the approach was normal until final approach when the airspeed indicator suddenly indicated a drop in airspeed to 20 mph.  The pilot initially thought that it was wind shear or a stall and pushed the nose down and closed the spoilers.  The airspeed indicator then indicated 70 mph and the glider's descent rate decreased.  Because of the decrease in descent rate, the pilot now determined that his airspeed and altitude were too high for a safe landing on the airstrip.  The pilot opted to land in an open field with tall grass adjacent to the airstrip.  After making the decision to land in the field, the pilot, in an attempt to stay aloft longer, tried to start the engine even though he was aware that operating procedures did not recommend it.  The pilot stated that he left the cowl flaps closed, left the fuel off because he believed that there was enough fuel in the system to start the engine, and he left the propeller feathered so as not to increase drag.  The engine did not start and the pilot continued with the off airstrip landing.  After flying over another glider and tow plane on the ground at about 10 feet above ground level, the glider suddenly stalled, dragging a wing and impacting the ground hard in a field next to the airstrip.

The captain, who was also the company chief pilot and check airman, was the flying pilot, and the first officer was the non flying pilot.   Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  Area weather reporting stations reported the presence of freezing rain and snow for a time period beginning several hours before the accident.   The captain did not obtain the destination airport weather observation until the flight was approximately 30 nautical miles from the airport. The flight received radar vectors for a instrument landing system approach to runway 30 (5,401 feet by 100 feet, grooved asphalt).  The company's training manual states the MU-300's intermediate and final approach speeds as 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and Vref, respectively.  Vref was reported by the flight crew as 106 KIAS.  During the approach, the tower controller (LC) gave the option for the flight to circle to land or continue straight in to runway 30.  LC advised that the winds were from 050-070 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots, and runway braking action was reported as fair to poor by a snow plow.
