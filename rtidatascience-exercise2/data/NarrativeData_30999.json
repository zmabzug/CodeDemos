According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot called the Reno Automated Flight Service Station at 0941 and filed an IFR flight plan, then asked for the winds aloft forecast, which was provided.  The pilot did not request any additional weather briefing information for the flight.  No other record was found that the pilot obtained additional weather forecast information from any official source associated with the FAA or the National Weather Service.  At the time of the pilot's call to the Reno AFSS, several AIRMET weather advisories had been issued hours prior detailing warnings for  turbulence and clear icing along the route of flight.  The advisories warned of occasional moderate turbulence below 18,000 feet in moderately strong westerly winds especially in the vicinity of mountainous terrain.  Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) between 18,000 and 40,000 feet was forecast over the area of the accident site due to jet stream wind shear and mountain wave activity. The pilot departed under visual flight rules (VFR) and picked up his instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance en route and climbed to 14,000 feet.  The pilot later asked if he could maintain 12,500 feet.  The controller advised him that the minimum IFR altitude on this segment of his route was 14,000 feet, and the pilot cancelled his IFR flight plan.  The controller advised the pilot that he had lost radar contact, and instructed the pilot to squawk VFR and the pilot acknowledged the transmission.  The last radar target was about 1/2 mile east of Eagle Peak (elevation 9,920 feet) in the Warner Mountains.  Rescuers discovered the wreckage near the crest of Eagle Peak on November 23.  Investigators found no anomalies with the airframe, engines, or propellers that would have precluded normal operation.  The NWS had a full series of AIRMETs current over the proposed route of flight, which included mountain obscuration, turbulence, and icing.  Analysis of the weather conditions disclosed a layer between 9,500 and 11,000 feet over the accident site area as having a high likelihood of severe or greater turbulence.  A pilot on the same route of flight reported at 1127 that he was in instrument conditions at 11,000 feet, and experiencing light turbulence and light clear icing conditions.  He also reported encountering updrafts of 2,000 feet per minute, which was indicative of mountain wave activity.  A company pilot was in a second Aero Commander trailing the accident airplane and he reported that at 1147, at a position near the accident site, he encountered a severe downdraft.  He applied full climb power, but as the airplane passed over the accident site position, the airplane continued to lose altitude even at maximum power.  At 1159, he was able to gain altitude, and return to his assigned cruising altitude of 14,000 feet.  The second Aero Commander was turbocharged, the accident airplane was not.  Analysis showed that the topography of the area was critical in this case, given that the accident site was at an elevation of 9,240 feet on the eastern slope of Eagle Peak.  The accident airplane's flight track was normal along the airway until immediately downwind of the higher terrain.  As the flight approached the lee side of the mountain, it came under the influence of the mountain wave and first encountered an updraft and then a downdraft, which increased in amplitude as the flight progressed towards Eagle Peak.  Eagle Peak was the tallest point along the Warner Mountain range and the steep slope of this terrain was significant when the mountain wave action was encountered.  Such terrain features have been known to enhance the vertical downdrafts and updrafts associated with the most intense mountain wave turbulence.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's encounter with forecast mountain wave conditions, moderate or greater turbulence, and icing, with downdrafts that likely exceeded the climb capability of the airplane, which was encountered at an altitude that precluded recovery.  Also causal in the accident was the failure of the pilot to obtain an adequate preflight weather briefing which would have included a series of Airmets that were in effect at the time."

The pilot reported that when he arrived at McCall, it was dusk, but he could still see the runway environment. He therefore decided to make his approach to runway 34 and then sidestep for a landing on the parallel taxiway. Although the approach to the runway and the side-step to align with the taxiway were uneventful, as the pilot was attempting to flare for the landing on the taxiway, he allowed the airspeed to get too low, and the aircraft descended onto the taxiway surface at an excessive rate, resulting in a hard bounced landing.  As the aircraft touched down a second time, it was misaligned with the taxiway centerline, and as the pilot was trying to reestablish directional control, the aircraft departed the taxiway and impacted a nearby ditch. During the accident sequence a small fire started, and because the pilot had no means by which to extinguish it, the fire eventually consumed almost the entire aircraft. According to the pilot, there was no indication that there had been any mechanical malfunction or anomaly that had contributed to the accident.",

A flight plan found in the wreckage with the accident pilot's name on listed the fuel onboard as 3 hours and 30 minutes and a flight distance of 240 miles. The airplane wreckage was located about 130 miles from the departure airport. Postaccident examination of the propeller indicated that the engine was not producing power at impact.Examination of the wreckage and surrounding vegetation revealed no evidence of fuel within the fuel tanks and only slight amounts of blight, consistent with fuel spillage, on nearby vegetation at the accident site. Fuel staining was observed on the right wing, and the fuel cap did not have a detent. If the pilot had performed a preflight inspection of the airplane before departure, he would have noticed the fuel staining; thus it likely occurred during the accident flight, although it could not be determined why the pilot did not notice the loose fuel cap. Given the distance flown and cruise speed, the airplane's published fuel consumption indicates that the airplane would have consumed about 11 gallons of fuel in the 90 minutes of flight. Although both fuel tanks likely contained enough fuel for a flight longer than 90 minutes at takeoff, it is likely that any fuel in the right fuel tank was syphoned out during flight due to the loose fuel cap. Even though the estimated fuel consumption calculations showed that the total quantity consumed was less than what was indicated the flight plan, the lack of fuel observed at the accident site and the lack of evidence of any preexisting mechanical anomalies indicate that the total loss of engine power was likely the result of fuel exhaustion. Although the fuel selector valve's Teflon plunger was found fractured, which resulted in the selector valve binding, the fracture was consistent with impact damage.The airplane was not reported overdue for several days and was located in a wooded area about 3 days after it had departed. The airplane's emergency locator transmitter (ELT) unit had an \"ON/OFF/ARM\" switch that was found in the \"OFF\" position. The ELT may have been deactivated by first responders; however, given that there were no reports of ELT signals being detected in the area from the day of the accident until the airplane was located, the ELT was likely in the \"OFF\" position before the flight and did not activate due to the switch position, which delayed the search and rescue of the occupants.

He then completed the engine run-up checks, and noticed no anomalies.  After departure, the pilot selected 1,500 feet mean sea level (MSL) for an initial cruising altitude.  Once clear of class 'B' airspace, the pilot varied his altitude between 1,500 and 4,500 feet MSL.  In addition, he set the cruise power at 75 percent.  Approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes into the flight, engine power became intermittent, followed by a total loss.  The pilot's first reaction was to rock the airplane's wings because he knew he was low on fuel.  The pilot then executed a forced landing to a field.  During the landing, the airplane contacted a fence and nosed over.  The pilot operating handbook (POH) stated that at 7,000 feet and 75 percent power, the airplane would have 4.1 hours of fuel endurance.

Light winds and daylight visual meteorological conditions prevailed. Radar and GPS data showed that the return portion of the flight followed an essentially straight track in the direction of the pilot\u2019s home airport at an altitude of about 1,500 feet above ground level with a groundspeed of about 100 knots. When the airplane was about 12 miles from the airport, the groundspeed decreased to about 60 knots over a period of about 25 seconds. The airplane then entered a descent of about 800 feet per minute, which it maintained for the next minute. Shortly after the start of that descent, the transponder was switched to the emergency code of 7700. About 25 seconds later, the pilot transmitted a \u201cmayday\u201d call to the approach controller. He stated that he had a problem, and several seconds later, transmitted that he was \u201cgoing down.\u201d In the radio call, the pilot named the component that he thought was causing the problem, but the transmission quality prevented a positive determination of exactly what the pilot said. The descent rate then increased rapidly, and the airplane impacted terrain several seconds later. \u000b\u000bThe damage to the rudder stop, rudder, elevator trim tab link, and elevator trim tab was inconclusive as to whether it occurred in flight or on impact. Propeller damage indicated that the propeller was not rotating or was rotating with little engine power. However, no preimpact mechanical problems with the engine, propeller gearbox, or propeller were identified. \u000b\u000bThe reconstructed flight path was consistent with a significant deceleration at a near-constant altitude, followed by a descent to maintain flying speed, followed by a loss of control and/or aerodynamic stall at low altitude, from which the airplane did not recover. The airplane had slowed and started to descend when the pilot took the deliberate actions of squawking 7700 and transmitting a radio distress call. He attempted to describe the problem that he perceived. During that time, the data suggests that the airplane was still controllable and was under control. Shortly thereafter, as evidenced by the significantly increased descent rate and the pilot\u2019s transmission that he was going down, control was lost, and the airplane impacted the ground.\u000b\u000bThe limited propeller damage, coupled with the engine\u2019s dependence on electricity and its electronics for continued operation, suggest that the deceleration could have been a result of an engine power loss for electrical or electronic reasons that could not be determined during postaccident examination. The specific reason for the stall could not be determined; however, the pilot may have been distracted by the emergency or the radio calls. The investigation was unable to determine the accuracy of the airspeed indicator or stall speed values. Further, the airplane does have a limited natural stall warning and no stall warning system to alert the pilot to an impending stall, particularly if he was distracted.\u000b",

He was therefore forced to execute a power-off landing in an open field, where the aircraft's nose gear encountered some soft terrain and collapsed. A post-accident inspection determined that there was sufficient uncontaminated 100LL fuel on board. During a series of test runs, the engine ran extremely rough at rpm's below 1,500, and it quit a number of times during the run. The engine smoothed out some when the fuel  boost pump was turned on to the low position, and smoothed out even more when the pump was turned to the high position. The un-metered fuel pressure was measured, and although it was lower than the specification directed, it was not low enough to account for the very rough running engine.

Further flow tests and inspections were performed on the fuel system components after they were removed from the aircraft, but the results of these tests did not reveal any anomalies that would be expected to cause the engine to run rough or quit while on a reduced power approach.

He further stated that the airplane might have entered an aerodynamic stall. He advanced the throttle to full forward, but the engine did not respond and subsequently experienced a total loss of power. He attempted to restart the engine by completing the emergency procedures that he remembered. The engine \u201cturned over\u201d but did not restart. He then prepared for a forced landing to a nearby field. During the base-to-final turn, he lost control of the airplane, and it descended to the ground.

A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that most of the induction air filter was obstructed by ice; no other anomalies were noted. The engine was test run with and without the ice in the air filter, and the engine produced full power under both conditions. The alternate air lever, which selects a second induction air intake in case the primary air intake (air filter) becomes restricted, was found in the \u201coff\u201d position. The aircraft flight manual states that, in the event of an in-flight engine failure, the alternate air control should be opened (or \u201con\u201d). A Federal Aviation Administration advisory circular warns pilots of induction system icing known as \u201cimpact ice,\u201d which can build up on components like the air filter when moisture-laden air is near freezing. Based on the near-freezing outside air temperature and clouds in the area in which the flight was operating and the lack of any apparent engine malfunctions, it is likely that the primary air induction system became obstructed with impact ice during the flight. When asked about the airplane\u2019s alternate air lever, the student pilot indicated that he was unfamiliar with the lever and did not know its intended use.

Shortly after departure, the pilot radioed that he was having electrical problems and he needed to return to the airport. On the airplane's approach to the runway, the airplane impacted the top of a tree, traveled southward before contacting a wire/cable, then impacted the ground coming to rest inverted.  A witness reported that the accident airplane was, \"very low on approach\", and it appeared that the airplane had \"no electrical power, and that the engine was at a low rpm.\"  The witness also reported that it was hard to tell if [the engine] was losing power completely.\"  The airplane was examined on-site, and during the examination it was found that the main lead (wire) to the alternator had separated from the alternator.  The alternator wire and the insulated terminal end had disconnected with the terminal ring remaining on the alternator.  Further inspection of the terminal ring and wire revealed that the terminal had a single pointed style crimp, and the (multi-strand) wire-end that had separated from the terminal ring appeared \"weathered.\" The on-site examination of the aircraft did not reveal any additional pre-impact mechanical anomalies.  An additional test on the engine was conducted at the engine manufacturer\u2019s test cell facility.  The engine was started and run for several minutes at various (idle to full) power settings.

During the landing, the airplane struck a fence post, which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing of the airplane.Postaccident examination revealed that the throttle lever clevis and throttle cable became separated from the throttle arm, which resulted in the engine being unresponsive to throttle input; thus, the pilot could not apply power to the engine from the idle position. No evidence of metal deformation existed on either the throttle lever clevis or on the throttle cable; however, examination of the cotter pin revealed that one prong was separated and unable to be located. Examination of the remaining portion of the cotter pin revealed that it was twice as long as manufacturer-approved guidance required. Examination of the clevis for the propeller cable linkage revealed that the cotter pin prongs exceeded Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 43-13-1B guidance by allowing the prong to exceed the pin diameter and the cotter pin prongs were not seated firmly against the shank. A review of maintenance records did not reveal when the cotter pin was replaced. The hardware was likely installed using the incorrect safetying technique and the improper length of cotter pin. This allowed the prong to become caught and subsequently fracture on nearby hardware, which resulted in the cotter pin becoming unsecured and separating from the linkage pin. Subsequently, the linkage pin detached, which allowed the throttle lever clevis and cable to separate from each other.

The pilot \u201ccut\u201d the throttle, flew the helicopter \u201cto the ground as fast as possible,\u201dand impacted terrain. A postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that the tail rotor gearbox did not operate when it was rotated. A teardown revealed that the interior surfaces of the gearbox were covered with a black oily substance consistent with residual lubricating oil contaminated with liberated metal particles. The oil level sight glass exhibited no discoloration or other hindrance to normal oil level detection in service. Examination of the ring and pinion gears revealed that the teeth on the pinion gear were deformed and worn almost down to the tooth root in some locations. Wear was observed on the top land and drive faces of the ring gear. Wear patterns were noted on the coast faces of the ring and pinion gear teeth. The observation of wear on the coast faces of the gear teeth is most probably an indication that the spacing between the gears was too tight as a result of improper alignment during installation, causing accelerated wear. A logbook entry showed that the helicopter\u2019s last annual inspection was completed about 6 months before the accident during which the tail rotor gearbox was overhauled and installed.",

An examination of the airplane revealed that the left main fuel tank was empty; however, the right main fuel tank and tip tank contained fuel. According to a telephone conversation with the pilot, during his pre landing preparation he noted that the left fuel tank was \"low\" and switched from the left fuel tank to the right fuel tank. Shortly thereafter he noted that the engine had lost power. He attempted to restart the engine by turning the auxiliary fuel pump on and \"cranking\" the engine. According to the emergency procedures section in the Pilot's Operating Handbook the correct in-flight engine restart procedure requires the pilot to maintain 85 knots indicated airspeed, check fuel quantity, switch the fuel selector to the fullest tank, mixture set to rich, auxiliary pump to the \"on\" position for three to five seconds with the throttle open, then off, ignition switch to both, and advance the throttle slowly.

The copilot said he considered the approach normal and that the captain did all he could to stop the airplane, first applying the brakes and then pulling up on the thrust reversers twice, with no sensation of slowing at all.  Considering the double malfunction and the mountainous terrain surrounding the airport, the captain elected not to go around.  The aircraft subsequently overran the end of the 5,860 foot runway (5,260 feet usable due to the 600 displaced threshold), went through the airport boundary fence, across the perimeter road, and came to rest upright in a dry lakebed approximately 400 feet from the departure end of the runway.  With the aircraft on fire, the five passengers and two crew members safely egressed the aircraft without injuries before it was consumed.  Witnesses to the landing reported the aircraft touched down at midfield, was too fast, porpoised, and was bouncing trying to get the gear on the runway.  Passengers recalled a very hard landing, being thrown about the cabin, and that the speed was excessive.  One passenger stated there was a hard bang and a series of smaller bangs during the landing.  Federal Aviation Regulations allowed 3,150 feet of runway for a full stop landing.  Under the weather conditions reported just after the mishap, and using the anticipated landing weight from the load manifest (12,172.5 pounds), the FAA approved Cessna Flight Manual does not provide landing distance information.  Post-accident examination and testing of various wheel brake and antiskid/power brake components revealed no anomalies which would have precluded normal operations.",

Contributing factors were the pilot's improper in-flight planning, improper use of performance data, the tailwind condition, failure to perform a go-around, and the pilot-induced porpoising condition."

Witnesses related that the helicopter had landed near a hotel and truck stop, and the pilot and passengers had inquired about renting rooms.  The pilot and passengers elected not to rent rooms, but walked to the truck stop and had a meal.  After the meal, the helicopter was seen departing to the south.  The helicopter did not arrive at its destination, and a search was initiated.  A witness in a car on a nearby freeway, about 6 miles from the truck stop, reported to the local sheriff's office three days after the accident, that he had seen an explosion south of the freeway the night of the accident.  Searchers located the helicopter in thick woods, in trees about 60 feet tall.  The wreckage was extensively fragmented, consistent with a high speed impact with the trees.

The private pilot and passenger were uninjured. The airplane sustained substantial wing damage. The airplane was purchased by and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Night visual flight rules (VFR) conditions prevailed for the flight, which did not operate on a flight plan. The flight originated about 2118 from the East Kansas City Airport (3GV), near Grain Valley, Missouri, and was destined for the Dalhart Municipal Airport (DHT), near Dalhart, Texas.According to preliminary information given to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the accident pilot reported that he had a mechanic perform a pre-purchase inspection of the airplane. The airplane was flown locally to test the function of the landing gear. The mechanic noted the installation of a new cylinder. Airplane logbooks were reviewed. The pilot and the mechanic departed in the airplane and subsequently contacted Kansas City Approach Control. The pilot requested flight following services to DHT. The airplane was flown at 8,500 feet above mean sea level during cruise flight. About 2.2 hours into the flight, the pilot heard a \"pop\" and felt a \"severe vibration\" for about five seconds. The engine \"rapidly\" lost power. An \"explosion\" was heard and the airplane subsequently decelerated and pitched down. The emergency locator transmitter activated following the explosion. The airplane was descending between 2,500 and 3,000 feet per minute. The pilot attempted to restart the engine. It did not restart and the pilot saw white light in a straight line. He elected to perform a forced landing to the west on the road. The landing gear selector was placed in the down position and only the main landing gear lights subsequently illuminated. The emergency landing gear extension procedures did not extend the nose landing gear. The pilot lined the airplane up with the road's shoulder so the left wing would not collide with oncoming traffic. The airplane touched down about 75 mph and the pilot held the nose gear up while attempting to avoid oncoming traffic. The airplane impacted a highway sign pole and the airplane subsequently turned 90 degrees to the right. The airplane then impacted a culvert, traveled over a ditch, and came to rest about 50 feet from the road.At 2335, the recorded weather at the Pratt Regional Airport, near Pratt, Kansas, was: Wind 230 degrees at 6 knots; visibility 10 statute miles; sky condition clear; temperature 1 degree C; dew point -2 degrees C; altimeter 30.21 inches of mercury.",

The pilot stated he departed with 24 gallons of fuel in the outboard tanks, and 80 gallons of fuel in the main tanks.  After landing, the airplane was refueled with 100 low-lead aviation gasoline; 12 gallons in each main fuel tank.  Before departing for the return flight, the pilot performed a preflight inspection of the airplane, which did not include a  visual check of the airplane's fuel tanks.  After takeoff, the pilot experienced a \"small surge in both engines,\" while climbing through 1,150 and 3,300 feet, respectively.  He further described the surges as \"minor but still noticeable.\"  About 30 minutes later, after the airplane had descended, and was leveling at 1,500 feet, the pilot experienced an intermittent illumination of the \"right aux fuel pump light,\" which was followed by a total loss of power on the right engine.  Shortly thereafter, the left engine began \"surging,\" and after about \"three or four minutes, at most,\" he feathered the left engine propeller.  The pilot ditched the airplane in Massachusetts Bay.  The airplane was recovered about 1 month later.  The fuel selectors were positioned to the outboard tanks, and the airplane's fuel tanks revealed fluid consistent with seawater with \"some odor of fuel;\" however, no visible evidence of fuel was observed.  According to the airplane's information manual, the airplane's total fuel capacity was 192 gallons, of which, 182 gallons were usable.  Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal evidence of any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  The pilot reported he had purchased the airplane and attended 5-day type specific training course in March 2001.  He reported about 1,050 hours of total fight experience, which included 800 hours in multi-engine airplanes, of which 65 hours was in the make and model.  Additionally, the pilot reported he had not experienced any prior mechanical problems.  He believed he had flown the airplane the day prior to the accident as well.  The last documented refueling of the airplane prior to the date of the accident occurred on May 3, 2001, when the airplane was refueled with 128 gallons of aviation gasoline.  The last flight documented in the pilot's logbook was on May 4, 2001, when the pilot logged 1.9 hours in the accident airplane.  The pilot said he normally flew a 65 percent power, an \"a little rich,\" and experienced a fuel burn of about 20 to 21 gallons per hour, for each engine.  ",

Contributing to the accident was the failure of the flight crewmembers to address the fact that the helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on their two prior departures from the accident site because they were accustomed to operating at the limit of the helicopter\u2019s performance. Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire that resulted from the spillage of fuel upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash resistant, and the use of an inappropriate release mechanism on the cabin seat restraints."
