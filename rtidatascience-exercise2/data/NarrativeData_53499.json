Witnesses then heard a loud sound, saw the glider spinning to the ground, and a portion of the right wing separate and fall to the ground. The glider continued to spin until it impacted terrain.

The pilot maneuvered the helicopter into a 25-foot hover and, just as he was beginning the transition to forward flight, he heard a loud bang. The helicopter experienced a power loss and the pilot lowered the collective slightly, resulting in a hard landing on the pad. A surveillance camera that captured the accident sequence indicated that after the helicopter lifted into a hover over the pad, the nose abruptly rotated right 90 degrees and the helicopter descended vertically in a slight nose-down attitude, landing hard on the helipad. The postaccident airframe examination revealed that the nuts that attach the engine-to-main gear box flex coupling were not present on their respective bolts. The nuts and associated washers were located loose and clumped together just forward of the gimbal ring in the transmission input housing. An examination of the bolts and flex coupling by the Safety Board Materials Laboratory concluded that the nuts most likely had been hand tightened and that cotter pins had not been installed on the bolts. The improper installation lead to the failure of the flex coupling and resulted in a loss of power to the rotor system. Maintenance records showed that 59 flight hours before the accident the engine had been removed, the helicopter painted, and then the engine was reinstalled. The time between the engine removal and the reinstallation was 88 days. The mechanic who removed the engine stated that he removed the bolts to the engine-to-main gear box flex coupling, and then partially reassembled the flex coupling bolts. This action was not in accordance with the AS350 maintenance manual engine removal procedure.

The overall maintenance activity involved a 100-hour inspection, which included a visual inspection of the engine-to-main gear box flex coupling.

The pilot was unsuccessful in stopping the airplane, and it struck three parked airplanes before the engine stopped.  Examination of the airplane revealed the throttle control lever was in the \"full forward\" position, the propeller control lever in the \"full aft\" position, and the mixture control lever in the \"idle cutoff\" position.   No anomalies were noted with the throttle linkage or the braking system.  According to the airplane's flight manual, the flooded start procedure included, \"Clear by operating starter for 5 seconds with mixture at idle cutoff, throttle open, then use normal starting procedure.

            "narrative": "On October 19, 2014, about 1530 Alaska daylight time, a tailwheel-equipped Cub Crafters Inc., CC18-180 airplane, N537CC, sustained substantial damage following a loss of control, while attempting to drag an off-airport landing site near Anchorage, Alaska. The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country public-use flight, under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The airplane was operated by the U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The certificated commercial pilot and one passenger were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a VFR flight plan had been filed. The flight originated at the Soldotna Airport, Soldotna, Alaska, about 1500, destined for Pincher Creek Cabin an off-airport landing site, located within the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge near Anchorage, AK. During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on October 22, the pilot stated that before attempting a full stop landing, he planned to \"drag the site\", which involved doing a touch-and-go landing by placing the main landing gear wheels on the surface of the site to evaluate the surface before attempting a full stop landing. The pilot reported upon touchdown, the airplane bounced slightly, it settled back to the surface, and it subsequently veered to the left. Unable to correct for the veer the pilot applied full power in an attempt to initiate the go-around, but the airplane impacted the elevated edge of the creek bank and came to rest upright in the water, sustaining substantial damage to the left wing, elevators, and rudder.A postaccident examination of the airplane by the NTSB IIC, along with two other NTSB investigators, and two aviation safety inspectors from the Anchorage Flight Standards District Office revealed no mechanical irregularities that would have precluded normal operation. The closest weather reporting facility is Anchorage Airport, Anchorage, AK about 20 miles northeast of the accident site. At 1553, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) at Anchorage, Alaska, reported: wind 340 degrees at 4 knots; visibility, 10 statute miles; few clouds at 2,500 feet; broken clouds at 18,000 feet; temperature, 41 degrees F; dew point 26 degrees F; altimeter, 29.11 inHG.",

The airplane was landed without incident.  Examination of the airplane revealed the door contacted and punctured the right wing.  It then contacted and punctured the right horizontal stabilizer.  The emergency procedures section in the pilot operating handbook (POH) contains a warning which states, \"Do not open the cabin doors in flight.  The air loads placed on the doors in flight will damage them and can cause separation from the airplane.  A damaged or separated door will alter the flight characteristics of the airplane and possibly damage other control surfaces.\"  The POH also states the following warning in the Doors section of the Description of the Airplane and Systems section:  \"If the red \"Door Open\" annunciator light is on or the aural warning is playing, then one or more doors are not properly secured, and the airplane is unsafe to fly.\"",

Prior to departure, the pilot assembled the glider by himself.  During the initial climb out, the tow airplane's climb performance was poor, and the tow pilot noticed that the glider's spoilers were in the deployed position.  The tow pilot opted to return back to the airport and while in the turn, the glider pilot released from the towline.  The glider pilot announced over the radio that he was having problems with the spoilers and planned to attempt to maneuver back to the airport.  The glider turned and then continued on a flight path until impacting high-tension power lines.  The glider's service manual states that prior to departure the pilot should check the function of the control surfaces, and ensure that the spoilers are operating properly.  A post accident examination of the spoiler control rods inside the fuselage revealed that the inboard sections of both control rods were not connected to their corresponding bell crank.  The glider is designed in such a way that to assemble the spoilers, the person performing the assembly must access the control rods from the cockpit, by going through the aft bulkhead.  While connecting the spoilers, it is not possible to visually assess how to make the assembly.  The assembly must be done by feeling the parts and connecting them without any visual reference.",

During the landing roll on a dirt surface runway, the lower end of the left main landing gear strut fractured at the axle bolt holes, where the axle is bolted onto the strut.  The fractured end of the left gear strut dug into the ground, the airplane swerved 90 degrees to the left and nosed down, receiving structural damage to the left wingtip and the right main landing gear.  The main landing gear is a spring steel strut that is shot peened during manufacture, and is bolted to the fuselage at its upper end.  Photographs of the point of separation revealed a vertical fracture, oriented 90 degrees to the span of the gear strut, through the upper axle retaining bolt holes.  The fractured surface of the lower end of the strut, containing the axle and brake assembly, had a rough, crystalline appearance with darkening of the metal surface along the outer edges of the strut.  The fractured surface of the upper end of the strut, where it dug into the ground, had a smooth polished appearance.  Periodic visual inspection of the landing gear is required by 14 CFR Part 43.  Neither the manufacturer or the FAA have established service limits (hours or cycles) for the main landing gear strut.  Removal of the gear strut for inspection, or the use of nondestructive inspection techniques, is not required by the manufacturer or the FAA.  On March 16, 2001, the NTSB recommended that the FAA issue an airworthiness directive (AD) to require an initial and recurring inspection of Cessna main landing gear spring steel struts, using nondestructive inspection techniques.  On August 31, 2001, the FAA reported to the NTSB that the current inspection criteria outlined in the Cessna Maintenance Manual are adequate to detect cracks in the main landing gear struts, and that additional airworthiness action is not warranted.  On March 25, 2002, the NTSB responded by stating, in part:  \"The Safety Board continues to believe that a visual inspection alone will not detect cracks in the Cessna main landing gear spring struts.  However, the Safety Board acknowledges that the statistical evidence does not warrant issuance of ADs at this time as called for in the Board's recommendation.\"  In the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1), the pilot indicated that the landing gear strut, Part number 0741001-5, had accrued about 9,000 hours of service.  In the optional area of the report: Recommendation (How Could This Accident Have Been Prevented), the pilot wrote:  \"Put time life [limit] on gear legs.\"",

After the airplane was refueled, the pilot departed for his destination airport. About 200 miles from the destination airport, the airplane began experiencing a left rolling tendency, which required right aileron control inputs to counteract; the rolling progressively worsened as the flight continued. During that time, the pilot could have diverted to several other airports along his route of flight. While maneuvering in the traffic pattern at the destination airport, full right aileron control was required to maintain straight-and-level flight, and only a slight relaxing of right aileron control was needed to turn left. The pilot had difficulty compensating for a northwest crosswind and performed a go-around. During the second approach, the pilot lined up the airplane on the northern side of the runway approach course, and, subsequently, he attempted to perform another go-around. When the pilot applied engine power, the airplane began to roll slowly left despite right aileron and rudder control inputs. He decreased the engine power, but the airplane's left wing struck the ground, and the airplane flipped over. Examination of the airplane did not reveal any preimpact malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation; however, the condition of the wreckage, which included impact damage to the aileron control servo, precluded the ability to functionally check the flight control system, which was electrically actuated.

Shortly after takeoff, the PIC informed an air traffic controller that he had changed his plans, and he was cleared as requested to a nearby airport. The helicopter was observed to hover, land, and lift off for a circuit of the traffic pattern. It landed again, and began a second circuit. While on the downwind leg, the helicopter entered a descent that had a rate of approximately 2,400 feet per minute and subsequently impacted trees, terrain, and a house in a residential neighborhood. The PIC held multiple certificates and ratings, and the vast majority of his experience was in fixed-wing aircraft. He had about 140 hours of helicopter experience, and about 60 hours in Robinson helicopters.  The second pilot held multiple certificates and ratings, and had over 4,000 hours of helicopter flight experience. His most recent helicopter piloting experience was about 9 years prior to the accident. Due to certain flight and operational characteristics, the FAA mandated Robinson-specific training for pilots, via Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 73. The accident flight was the second pilot's first flight in a Robinson helicopter, and no records of any Robinson-specific training or endorsements, including those required by SFAR 73, were located for him. The final trajectory of the helicopter was consistent with a main rotor stall that developed when the helicopter was on the downwind leg. Post-accident examination and testing of the helicopter and components, including a full-power run of the engine, did not reveal any evidence of pre-impact failures or malfunctions. The helicopter manufacturer published notices for pilots that stated that main rotor stall due to low rotor rpm could occur rapidly, and at any airspeed, and could make \"recovery virtually impossible.\" Other guidance noted that appropriate pilot response to an impending stall in an airplane was the opposite of the appropriate response for the helicopter, and could result in, or aggravate, rotor stall. The reason for the decay of the main rotor rpm could not be definitively determined.",

Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that the left elevator trim tab upper control cable exhibited significant corrosion and had separated. A detailed examination of the cable and the separation fracture surfaces revealed the presence of significant, unabated corrosion, which had resulted in the cable losing an estimated 90 percent of its strength before ultimately failing in overload. However, it could not be determined whether the failure of this cable occurred before, or as a result of, the airplane\u2019s impact with terrain  or, what effect, if any, the in-flight failure of this cable could have had on the controllability of the airplane. The wreckage examination did not reveal any other evidence of preimpact mechanical discrepancies or malfunctions that would have prevented normal operation of the engine and airframe components.  No evidence was found indicating whether the pilot had intended to perform or had completed a structured flight test of the airplane\u2019s performance following the installation of the vortex generators in accordance with its operating limitations (outside of the single, 7-minute solo flight that immediately preceded the accident flight) before operating a flight with a passenger onboard.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain control of the airplane while flying at low speed, which resulted in a subsequent aerodynamic stall, spin, and impact with terrain. Contributing to the outcome of the accident was the pilot\u2019s decision to operate the airplane with a passenger aboard before fully evaluating the airplane\u2019s handling characteristics after vortex generators were installed."

The flight was being conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 as a repositioning flight. The intent of the flight was a prescribed inter-hospital transfer of a cardiac patient from the Watonga Municipal Hospital to the University of Oklahoma Medical Center. Of the three crewmembers onboard, the commercial pilot and flight nurse sustained fatal injuries and the paramedic sustained serious injuries. Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the vicinity along the route of flight and accident site and a company flight plan was filed with EagleMed flight dispatch control. The flight originated from the Integris Baptist Hospital (OK19) helipad at 0538 and its intended destination was Watonga, Oklahoma.SkyConnect satellite data showed that the helicopter departed OK19 and began a gradual climb on a northwest bearing toward Watonga. The data stopped approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds into the flight. A person who was driving in the vicinity of the accident site reported that he distinctly observed a \"flash\" in the sky in front of him. After the flash, he saw the helicopter in an increasingly rapid descent before it disappeared behind buildings. He then drove toward an area where smoke was emanating and saw that the helicopter was on fire in the parking lot of St. Ann\u2019s. He immediately assisted others (St. Ann\u2019s employees) in pulling the surviving paramedic away from the burning aircraft.Fixed video surveillance cameras located on a building adjacent to the parking lot showed the last few seconds of the helicopter descending toward the ground. The video showed that the helicopter burst into flames upon impact. From the initial impact point, the debris path was approximately 75 feet in length, on a heading of 065 degrees magnetic. All of the impact signatures were consistent with a right side low (approximate 40 degree) attitude, with a high rate of descent. Using the geometry of impact signatures and adjacent structures clearance, the helicopter\u2019s angle of descent was approximately 25 degrees.At 04:53, an automated weather reporting facility at the Wiley Post Airport (KPWA), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, reported wind from 340 degrees at 10 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, temperature 19 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 12 degrees F, and a barometric pressure of 30.02 inches of mercury.",

A witness stated the pilot and two other personnel tried to turn the airplane around by hand before departure with negative results. The pilot entered the airplane, released the parking brake, exited the airplane, and the airplane was attempted to be moved again with negative results. The pilot and passenger entered the airplane and the pilot started the engine, turned the airplane around with power, and taxied to runway 06. The witness observed the airplane on its takeoff roll. The airplane traveled about 400 to 500 feet before reaching his location and the airplane ground speed was estimated at between 15 to 20 knots.

The airplane became airborne rolled to the right, and disappeared from view. The runway was measured to be 1,383 feet long and 80 wide by the FAA. The Aircraft Owner's Manual showed the takeoff roll on a hard surface runway would be 790 feet, and 808 feet on a soft surface. Examination of the runway by the FAA revealed the airplane traveled 819 feet on the takeoff roll before encountering the dirt section of the runway. Two skid marks were present in the dirt on the runway. The left skid mark was measured 417 feet long and the right skid mark was measured 388 feet long. Ten feet past the left skid mark appeared to be a tail strike mark on a stone with a blue color. The bottom of the accident airplane is blue in color.

A follow up examination by the FAA revealed thread damage was present on the No.1 cylinder induction tube bolt holes and improper sized threaded bolts had been installed in the No.1 and No. 3 cylinder induction tube bolt holes. Testing of an IO 360 engine at the engine manufacturer revealed with a separated induction tube from a cylinder intake port at 2,650 rpm, the engine rpm remained relatively constant.

Both aircraft sustained minimal damage during the impact but substantial damage during the subsequent forced landings. The airplane pilot was performing a local flight and was not in contact with air traffic control (ATC) before the collision. The helicopter pilot was receiving visual flight rules flight following services from ATC throughout the flight.\u000b\u000bThe helicopter pilot transitioned between two ATC sectors before the accident. On multiple occasions, the controllers for each sector misidentified the last three digits of the helicopter\u2019s call sign. Additionally, the controller in the accident sector issued a traffic advisory using the wrong call sign. Further, an aircraft with the same last three digits as the helicopter\u2019s incorrect call sign made radio contact with the controller shortly before the collision, which increased the confusion.\u000b\u000bAudio data revealed that the air traffic controller provided multiple traffic advisories to the helicopter but did not issue an alternate or immediate course of action in accordance with ATC procedures despite the fact that the aircraft\u2019s converging flightpaths had triggered the radar conflict alert system. Radar playback also revealed that, at that time, the controller was receiving a visual alert on the radar console. This alert was also observed by a controller in an adjacent approach sector who called the radar assist controller warning of the threat. The assist controller responded, \u201cyeah, we\u2019re givin\u2019 him traffic.\u201d A few seconds later, the radar targets merged.\u000b\u000bThe helicopter pilot stated that she received and complied with the traffic advisories by performing a visual scan but that, based on her communications with the air traffic controller, she did not perceive the situation to be urgent. Radar data revealed that the helicopter descended 600 feet before the collision but that the pilot did not inform the air traffic controllers about the descent. Further, as the airplane got closer and the traffic advisories were issued, the helicopter pilot began turning north, which brought the helicopter directly into the path of the approaching airplane while simultaneously placing the airplane behind her immediate field of vision. Shortly after, she sighted a silhouette of the airplane and propeller at her 4-o\u2019clock position. She performed an evasive maneuver to the left but then felt the helicopter being struck. Neither the airplane pilot nor the occupant observed another aircraft near the airplane before the collision. Although the airplane pilot was not receiving traffic advisories from ATC, it was still the pilot\u2019s responsibility to maintain a proper visual lookout to avoid other aircraft in the area. The helicopter\u2019s left navigation light was inoperative when tested after the accident; however, this most likely did not affect the outcome because the left side of the helicopter would not have been visible to the airplane pilot at any point during the flight.",

Witness observations and wreckage distribution indicate that about 513 feet into the takeoff roll, the airplane's tail skid struck the runway. About the 750-foot point, the airplane departed the left side of the runway and struck two runway/taxiway signs before becoming airborne around the 937-foot point. Impact with the signs resulted in severe damage to the left horizontal stabilizer. Shortly after becoming airborne, the airplane rolled into a steep right bank, nosed down, and impacted the runway. No preimpact anomalies were noted during examination of the airframe and engine. Measurement of the flap actuator indicated the flaps were in the full down position. The flap selector lever was found in the full up position; however, the lever was bent over to the right, indicating that it was damaged and likely moved during the impact sequence or when the pilot exited the airplane. According to the pilot's operating handbook (POH) for the airplane, flap deflections greater than 10 degrees are not approved for takeoff.  Verifying the flap setting is an item included in the Before Takeoff, Normal Takeoff, and Short Field Takeoff checklists in the POH. The evidence indicates that the pilot omitted the checklist item to verify the flap setting and inadvertently initiated a takeoff with the wing flaps in the 30-degree (full down) position. Early in the takeoff roll, the airplane's nose pitched up, the tail skid struck the ground, and the pilot lost directional control. Instead of aborting, the pilot continued the takeoff, and the airplane exited the runway and hit two runway/taxiway signs, which severely damaged the left horizontal stabilizer.

            "narrative": "On May 16, 2015, about 1231 central daylight time, a Piper PA-24-260 airplane, N9032P, impacted terrain near Spring Branch, Texas. The pilot and three passengers sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was destroyed during the impact and subsequent ground fire. The airplane was registered to an individual and was operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as personal flight. Day visual flight rules conditions prevailed for the flight, which did not operate on a flight plan. The local flight originated from the Kestrel Airpark (1T7), near Spring Branch, Texas.A witness at 1T7 saw the accident airplane taxi from the common area/hangars on the north taxiway and saw it headed to runway 12. There was a strong quartering headwind for runway 12. The witness estimated the wind was 20 knots sustained, gusting 25-30 knots. He watched the accident airplane's takeoff roll. The aircraft climbed and was about 20-30 feet in the air when it was abeam the witness. The aircraft's nose dropped for a couple seconds after it passed him. It then started climbing out and the witness saw and heard the landing gear retracting. The airplane was about 100 feet above the ground. The aircraft then looked like it weather vaned into the wind and continued climbing to about 200-300 feet above the ground. At that point, the witness stopped watching the airplane. He stated that he did not notice anything fall off the airplane or anything unusual about the appearance of sound of the airplane during its taxi by and its takeoff.Preliminary witness reports indicated that the airplane banked left during the takeoff, descended steeply, and impacted terrain near a store parking lot.A video file from that store parking lot camera was reviewed. The video showed that a flame, consistent with a ground fire, started at 1231.The 38-year-old pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) private pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land and multi engine land ratings. He held a FAA airframe and powerplant mechanic certificate. A preliminary review of FAA records show that the pilot's last medical examination was completed on March 29, 2010, when he was issued a first-class medical certificate with no limitations. On the application for that medical certificate, the pilot reported that he had accumulated 96 hours of total flight time.N9032P, a 1966 model Piper PA-24-260, Comanche, serial number 24-4494, was an all-metal airplane with semimonocoque fuselage and empennage construction. The airplane's type certificate data indicated that it seated four and had a maximum gross weight of 3,100 pounds. The airplane was powered by a 260-horsepower, six-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air cooled, fuel injected engine, normally aspirated engine, with a data plate marked as Lycoming IO-540-D4A5, serial number L-3449-48. The airplane was equipped with wing flaps, a two-bladed constant speed Hartzell model propeller, and retractable tricycle landing gear.Some of the accident airplane's logbooks were reviewed at the pilot's hangar. Endorsements showed that an annual inspection was completed on September 3, 2012. The airplane had accumulated a total time of 8,690.9 hours at that time. Recent airplane logbooks were not found within the hangar.A receipt showed that the airplane was serviced at 1T7 with 49.7 gallons of aviation gasoline (avgas) on May 16, 2015 at 1059.Preliminary information indicated that N9032P was involved in a ground accident in November of 2013. The airplane's left wing impacted a hangar and it sustained damage. The airplane was salvaged and subsequently sold the pilot.At 1206, the recorded weather at the San Antonio International Airport (SAT), near San Antonio, Texas, was: Wind 150 degrees at 13 knots; visibility 10 statute miles; sky condition scattered clouds at 2,200 feet, broken clouds at 3,000 feet, broken clouds at 4,300 feet; temperature 27 degrees C; dew point 22 degrees; altimeter 29.88 inches of mercury.At 1251, the recorded weather at SAT was: Wind 160 degrees at 13 knots, gusting to 22 knots; visibility 9 statute miles; sky condition scattered clouds at 2,300 feet, broken clouds at 3,700 feet, broken clouds at 4,800 feet; temperature 28 degrees C; dew point 22 degrees; altimeter 29.86 inches of mercury.1T7, located about 26 miles north of San Antonio, Texas, was a non-towered airport, which was privately owned and operated by the Kestrel Airpark Runway Association. The airport is a public use airport. Its field elevation was 1,261 feet above mean sea level. The airport listed 122.975 megahertz as its common traffic advisory frequency. The airport is serviced by one runway: runway 12/30. The runway is listed as a 3,000-foot by 40-foot asphalt runway. The runway has an operational restriction listed, which indicated that runway 30 rises rapidly at its north end.A postaccident on-scene investigation was conducted. All major components of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. The airplane came to rest on terrain and on top of a retaining wall adjacent to a store parking lot about 1/4 mile and 22 degrees from the intersection of US Highway 281 North and Flightline Drive. The airplane's left wing separated from its fuselage and it was found resting on the side of a retaining wall. The left wing exhibited an outboard skin section that was not painted. This section was consistent with a wing skin replacement. The unpainted section was intact and it remained attached to its wing.The airplane's fuselage and empennage was found resting on terrain at the top of the retaining wall. The cockpit was deformed, discolored, and sections consumed consistent with a ground fire. The right wing was also deformed, discolored, and an inboard section of it was consumed by fire. The empennage was deformed forward into the fuselage in an accordion like fashion. An outboard section of the left horizontal stabilizer was deformed and discolored. The nylock nuts that held the horizontal stabilizer were in-place and could be removed by fingertip pressure. Flight control cables were traced from the cockpit to each control surface. All observed separations in the flight control system were consistent with overload. The flaps and landing gear were found in their retracted positions.The engine and propeller were found forward of the fuselage near the base of a tree that was discolored consistent with a coating of soot. One propeller blade was separated near its hub and the other propeller blade's tip was separated. The separated tip exhibited chordwise gouges on its flat face. The engine was intact and displayed no signs of catastrophic failure. The engine's accessory case was discolored and deformed. The right magneto and the aft section of the engine driven fuel pump were not in place on the accessory case. The top spark plugs and accessory case were removed. The engine's crankshaft was rotated by hand. Crankshaft continuity was confirmed from the propeller flange to each of the cylinders and to the accessory drive gears. A thumb compression check was performed and all cylinders exhibited a thumb compression. The left magneto exhibited thermal deformation and discoloration. The fuel manifold was intact and its disassembly revealed a trapped liquid that contained water as detected by water disclosing paste. The fuel servo was deformed and discolored. Engine control cables were traced from the cockpit to their respective engine controls. All separations in the engine controls were consistent with overload. The components did not display any anomalies that could not be attributed to the post accident fire.Members of the pilot's family were asked to locate the pilot's logbook and recent airplane logbooks for review.The Comal County Coroner was asked to arrange for an autopsy to be completed on the pilot to include taking samples for toxicological testing.",

The pilot declared an emergency, and diverted to the nearest airport, where the airplane landed without incident.  According to the flight crew, just prior to the smell and smoke, there was a crew change that required the cockpit security door to be opened and closed.  An examination of the security door by maintenance personnel and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) revealed an excess length of wiring, which provides power to the electrically locking security door, was laying atop the door's metal-encased, unshielded, locking solenoid inside the doorframe.  Several of the wires were encased in a plastic anti-chafe mesh.  A portion of the mesh was melted, and had the smell of burnt plastic.  During a discussion with the IIC, a mechanic said he had seen similar doors overheat when the door and frame were misaligned, prohibiting full extension of the locking bolt.  The cockpit door was modified in accordance with Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) ST01391LA, which meets the FAA's requirements for a reinforced cockpit door.  The door uses a \"demand access\" electrically operated door latching solenoid.  The door manufacturer issued an addendum to the airplane manufacturer's maintenance manual.  The addendum includes removal, installation, and system tests of the striker/solenoid unit.  The installation section does not specifically address the issue of securing excess wiring located above the striker/solenoid within the doorframe.  The installation instructions do contain a \"caution,\" referencing the need for the security bolt to engage fully.  Failure of the bolt to fully engage will cause the solenoid to remain energized and overheat.  Construction of the striker/solenoid assembly is such that the metal-encased electrical coil of the unshielded solenoid is the upper-most portion of the assembly within the doorframe.  The installation includes a warning light that illuminates if the solenoid does not shut off.  The crew did not report seeing the warning light in-flight, and the light and locking mechanism functioned properly during subsequent tests on the ground; it was not tested in-flight.  The conversion of the door was completed on March 21, 2003.  Prior to the incident, the new security door had been in service about 16,416 flight hours, and 1170 cycles.  FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 65-15A, Chapter 11, covers practices and procedures for the installation and maintenance of aircraft electrical wiring.  The AC notes that practices and procedures outlined in this section are general recommendations, and are not intended to replace the manufacturer's instructions.  Chapter 11, page 441, Slack in Wiring Bundles, states: \"Single wires or wire bundles should not be installed with excessive slack.\"  Page 442, Routing and Installations, states: \"All wires and wire groups should be routed and installed to protect them from: (2) high temperatures.\"    ",
            "probable_cause": "The inadequate installation of the cockpit security door locking device, which resulted in smoke in the cockpit during normal cruise, and a precautionary landing.  A factor associated with the incident was the manufacturer's insufficiently defined installation instructions."

A review of a security video showed that the helicopter cabin was partially under a circular metal canopy that covered the island. After fueling and while still under the canopy, the helicopter lifted off, and the pilot immediately made a right turn. After turning nearly 180 degrees, the helicopter pitched forward, and the tail and main rotor blades rose and contacted the metal canopy. The helicopter then began to flail while turning and subsequently came to rest after turning 180 degrees back to its original direction. Several seconds later, a fire and explosion occurred. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.An review of the autopsy report revealed that the pilot\u2019s death was caused by thermal-related injuries and that he most likely would have survived the accident if no fire had occurred. The helicopter manufacturer issued several service bulletins advising owners to retrofit R44 all-aluminum fuel tanks with bladder-type tanks to improve the R44 fuel system\u2019s resistance to a postaccident fuel leak and the potential for a subsequent fire. The helicopter had not been retrofitted with these modifications. The NTSB has issued Safety Recommendation A-14-1 to the Federal Aviation Administration to require the retrofit.",

However, during the landing roll at their home base, the thrust reversers, steering, and braking systems did not respond. As the airplane approached the end of the runway, the pilot activated the emergency braking system; however, the airplane overran the end of the runway, coming to rest in a ditch. None of the three occupants were injured, but the airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage. \u000b\u000bTwo squat switches provided redundancy within the airplane\u2019s electrical system and were configured to prevent inadvertent activation of the thrust reversers and nosewheel steering during flight and to prevent the airplane from landing with the brakes already applied. Because postaccident examination revealed that the squat switch assemblies on the left and right landing gear struts were partially detached from their mounting pads such that both switches were deactivated, all of these systems were inoperative as the airplane landed.\u000b\u000bThe switch assemblies were undamaged, and did not show evidence of being detached for a long period of time. The brakes and steering were working during taxi before departure, but this was most likely because either one or both of the switches were making partial contact at that time. Therefore, it was most likely that the squat switch assemblies were manipulated on purpose during maintenance in an effort to set the airplane\u2019s systems to \u201cair mode.\u201d Examination of the maintenance records did not reveal any recent procedures that required setting the airplane to air mode, and all mechanics involved in the maintenance denied disabling the switches. Mechanics did, however, miss two opportunities to identify the anomaly, both during the return-to-service check and the predelivery aircraft and equipment status check. The anomaly was also missed by the airplane operator\u2019s mechanic and flight crew who performed the preflight inspection.\u000b\u000bThe airplane\u2019s emergency braking system was independent of the squat switches and appeared to operate normally during a postaccident test. Prior to testing, it was noted that the emergency brake gauge indicated a full charge; therefore, although evidence suggests that the emergency brake handle was used, it was not activated with enough force by the pilot. The pilot later conceded this fact and further stated that he should have used the emergency braking system earlier during the landing roll.\u000b\u000bThe airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which captured the entire accident sequence. Analysis revealed that the airplane took just over 60 seconds to reach the runway end following touchdown, and, during that time, two attempts were made by the pilot to activate the thrust reversers. The pilot stated that as the airplane approached the runway end, the copilot made a third attempt to activate the thrust reversers, which increased the engine thrust, and thereby caused the airplane to accelerate. Audio captured on the CVR corroborated this statement.\u000b\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "Failure of maintenance personnel to reattach the landing gear squat switches following maintenance, which rendered the airplane's steering, braking, and thrust reverser systems inoperative during landing. Contributing to the accident were the failure of both the maintenance facility mechanics and the airplane operator's mechanic and flight crew to identify the error during postmaintenance checks, a failure of the airplane's pilot to apply the emergency brakes in a timely manner, and the copilot's decision to attempt to engage the thrust reversers as the airplane approached the runway end despite multiple indications that they were inoperative and producing partial forward, rather than reverse, thrust."

The commercial pilot was fatally injured during the accident. One passenger died on June 18, 2013, while being treated for her injuries sustained during the accident. The other passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by a private individual, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the pleasure flight that departed Monte Vista Municipal Airport (KMVI), Monte Vista, Colorado, about 1015, and was en route to Fremont County Airport (1V6), Cannon City, Colorado.The pilot\u2019s son reported that he received a brief phone call from his father at 0954, during which his father told him that he was departing shortly for a flight north of the San Luis Valley, up to Salida and Canyon City. The pilot\u2019s son indicated that his father had flown in the mountains for several years and that it was not uncommon for him to use the Medano Pass to cross over the Sangre De Cristo Mountain Range. He indicated that the Medano Pass, situated at 10,030 feet mean sea level, was the lowest mountain pass in the nearby area which allows passage to the Wet Mountain Valley on the northeast side of the mountain range.About 1045, several witnesses who were located along the Medano Pass Primitive Road, reported seeing the accident airplane flying low to the treeline (about 100-200 feet above the ground) toward the Medano Pass. The witnesses remarked that the engine was operating normally as the airplane passed over their position at a slow speed, but the airplane\u2019s wings were banking up-and-down erratically. According to available information, there were no witnesses to the airplane impacting terrain. At 1101, a group of hikers notified local law enforcement of the accident after discovering the wreckage near the Medano Lake Trailhead junction.An on-scene investigation was completed by representatives with the National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Aviation Administration, National Park Service, and Lycoming Engines. The main wreckage contained all primary structural components and flight control surfaces. The accident site was located at 9,660 feet mean sea level. The lack of any significant tree damage and the absence of a wreckage debris path were consistent with a near vertical impact with the prevailing terrain. The engine was found partially buried in the terrain. There was fuel blight of the ground foliage located in front of the main wreckage. The accident site contained an odor consistent with aviation fuel. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the flight control surfaces to their respective cockpit controls. The flight control cables were subsequently cut to facilitate wreckage movement and recovery. The wing flap selector handle was found engaged in the second position, consistent with the wing flaps being partially extended; however, damage to the flap torque tube prevented an actual measurement of flap extension. Engine crankshaft rotation confirmed internal continuity to each engine cylinder, the valve train, and accessory-section gearing. Compression and suction were noted on each cylinder as the engine crankshaft was rotated. The spark plug electrodes exhibited normal burn signatures and coloration. The engine fuel pump outlet line contained trace amount of fuel. The carburetor exhibited damage consistent with impact. The right magneto provided spark on all leads when rotated with an electric drill. The left magneto was unable to be tested because of impact damage to the distributor cap. The propeller was found located in front of the main wreckage, separated from the engine crankshaft flange. Both propeller blades exhibited leading edge damage, S-shaped bending, and burnishing of the blade backs. No preimpact anomalies were identified during the on-site investigation that would have prevented normal operation of the airplane.The nearest aviation weather reporting station was located at San Luis Valley Regional Airport (KALS), Alamosa, Colorado, about 37 miles southwest of the accident site. At 1052, the KALS automated surface observing system reported the following weather conditions: wind 350 degrees true at 7 knots, visibility 10 miles, sky clear, temperature 21 degrees Celsius, dew point 0 degrees Celsius, altimeter setting 30.08 inches of mercury.",

About 5 minutes in to flight the vacuum instruments failed, then 5 minutes later, at 3,000 feet, the engine made a loud noise and black smoke entered the cockpit.  The smoke seemed to originate from the engine.  The engine lost power and was not responding to throttle adjustments.  The aircrew selected a green field into which to perform a forced landing.  During the landing touchdown the nose wheel caught the ground, and the airplane nosed over on to it's back.  Examination of the engine revealed that the woodruff key linking the oil pump drive shaft to the oil pump accessory gear had sheared, resulting in oil starvation and a catastrophic failure of the engine.",

The airplane was not able to maintain altitude, and the pilot initiated an emergency landing.  The airplane landed hard and slid to a stop.  The pilot exited the airplane during the onset of the post crash fire.  Extensive thermal deformation was found throughout the airplane and engine.
