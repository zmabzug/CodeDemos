When returning from the flight a 'severe bump' and 'loud bang' were experienced followed by the helicopter rotating to the right.  A pilot landed the helicopter in a field during which time it rolled over on its left side.  Post accident inspection revealed the No. 1 engine cowling separated from the helicopter inflight.  This damaged the main rotor blades which resulted in an imbalance and subsequent loss of the tail rotor gear box.  Both Hartwell cowling latches appeared in the closed position; however, the aft latch was not damaged as was the forward latch.  The manufacturer is aware of similar problems and has issued service bulletins addressing the problems.  The latest service bulletin, SB-MBB-BK 117-20-109, had not been incorporated on the accident helicopter. ",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to assure the engine cowling was secured during the aircraft preflight which resulted in the cowling separating from the helicopter and damaging the main rotor and tail rotor system.  Factors associated with the accident were the cowling not being secured and inadequate design of the latching system by the manufacturer. "

The flight instructor and private rated student were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a post-crash fire. The airplane was registered to Bravo Leasing LLC and operated by Phoenix East Aviation, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, as an instructional flight. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight and no flight plan was filed. The flight was originating at the time of the accident.According to the flight school, the purpose of the flight was to train the private pilot for his commercial pilot certificate.Preliminary information obtained from air traffic control personnel indicated that the airplane was on its second touch-and-go landing on runway 7R and was on the initial climb after takeoff.An airport employee, who was in his vehicle on the taxiway, stated that as the airplane climbed out he heard what sounded like a \"backfire\" coming from the direction of the airplane. He stopped his truck and turned towards the airplane and stated that the airplane descend below the tree line. They headed in the direction of the airplane and located it off of the airport property. When he arrived the airplane was engulfed in flames.Another witness reported that the airplane came over the tree line and it looked as if the pilot was turning back towards the airport. They said that the engine was running but it appeared as if the airplane had entered an aerodynamic stall before impacting the ground. The aircraft wreckage was located in an open field located about 220 feet south of the runway 7R centerline in an open field. The airplane came to rest in a flat attitude, on a course of about 060 degrees magnetic. The cockpit, cabin instrument panel and instruments were totally consumed by post-impact fire. All components of the airplane to include flight control surfaces were accounted for at the crash site.",

During the preflight, the pilot noted that the left tank had 105 gallons and that the right tank had 108 gallons. Because of the fuel level indications, the pilot did not visually inspect the tanks; even if he had done so the wing dihedral would have prevented him from seeing the fuel level.\u000b\u000bAbout 20 minutes after takeoff, the pilot received the first annunciation of \u201cFuel Low R,\u201d which lasted for about 10 seconds then went out. This indicates the fuel quantity is less than or equal to 9 gallons of usable fuel in the right tank. The pilot attributed this to a malfunction of the low fuel level sensor, since the fuel gauge showed about 98 gallons of fuel. He instructed the right front seat occupant (the mechanic) to make a note so the sensor would be replaced after the flight. Shortly thereafter, the amber \u201cFuel Unbalance\u201d illuminated, and indicated that the right fuel quantity was greater than the left; as a result the pilot switched the fuel selector to the right tank.\u000b\u000bHe then initiated a descent to 10,000 feet to perform system checks, and after levelling off at that altitude for about 15 minutes, received a second \u201cFuel Low R\u201d annunciation; he verified that the fuel selector automatically switched to the left tank and noted that the message went out after about 10 seconds. Either before or during a descent to 4,000 feet, the second \u201cFuel Unbalance\u201d annunciation occurred. The right tank again depicted a greater quantity of fuel, so the pilot again switched the fuel selector to the right tank. The flight continued to a nearby airport, where the pilot terminated an instrument approach with a low approach. The flight then proceeded to the destination airport and entered the traffic pattern on a left downwind leg..\u000b\u000bWhile on the downwind leg, the pilot received the third \u201cFuel Unbalance\u201d annunciation and at this time the left fuel gauge indicated 55 gallons while the right fuel gauge indicated 74 gallons. Because he intended to land within a few minutes, the pilot manually selected the fullest (right) tank, then turned to base then final. While at 800 feet on final approach, the red warning message \u201cFuel Press\u201d illuminated and the engine lost all power. Attempts to restore engine power were unsuccessful. Unable to reach the airport, the pilot landed on a nearby turnpike. Both fuel tanks were breached, and fuel leakage, likely  from the left fuel tank, was noted at the site. Inspection of the fuel outlet filter on the engine and the fuel sequencer reservoir considered an airframe item revealed both contained minimal fuel consistent with fuel starvation from the right fuel tank that actually did not contain an adequate supply of fuel.\u000b\u000bPostaccident operational testing of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction that would have resulted in the loss of power. Examination and testing of the right fuel gauge harness revealed that a high impedance shielded cable was not correctly soldered to the shielding braid when the airplane was manufactured, which resulted in erroneous high readings of the fuel quantity in the right tank. \u000b\u000bSeveral opportunities existed to detect the fuel quantity errors in the right tank during the airplane\u2019s 600-hour and annual inspection, which was signed off the day before. Several times during the inspection, electrical power was applied and different fuel quantities for the right tank were displayed, yet nothing was done to determine the reason for the different fuel indications. For example, 41 gallons was displayed, yet 70 gallons was drained; the fuel was returned to the tank after maintenance, yet the gauge showed 51 gallons, and after a post-maintenance run was performed, the gauge showed over 140 gallons even though it hadn\u2019t been fueled. Maintenance personnel incorrectly attributed the difference to fuel migration. Further, the pilot had the opportunity to terminate the test flight after multiple conflicting indications from  the right tank, yet he continued the test flight, which resulted in fuel starvation.\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to terminate the flight after observing multiple conflicting errors associated with the inaccurate right fuel quantity indication. Contributing to the accident were the total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation from the right tank, the inadequate manufacturing of the right fuel gauge electrical harness, and failure of maintenance personnel to recognize and evaluate the reason for the changing fuel level in the right fuel tank.

An incomplete radio call from the pilot indicated he was turning back. The controller saw the airplane flying southwest at a low altitude and shortly thereafter saw a cloud of black smoke about 1/2 mile south of the airport. Two other witnesses saw the airplane suddenly roll to the right and enter a nose-down dive, indicative of a stall. Evidence at the scene showed that the airplane impacted terrain in a nose-down attitude and came to rest inverted. There was a postimpact explosion and fire.Based on the pilot's lack of previous experience in flying an airplane with a turbocharged engine, and the evidence of detonation found in the postaccident examination of the engine, it is likely that the pilot inadvertently overboosted the engine during takeoff and initial climb, which resulted in a partial loss of engine power. Based on the sudden change of flight direction, it is likely that the pilot became preoccupied with the partial loss of engine power and lost control of the airplane. The instructor should have been able to successfully complete an emergency off-field landing, but it does not appear that he attempted one.This instructor had been using a series of psychotropic medications, culminating in his use of paroxetine, which would have been disqualifying for him to act as a required flight crewmember. Major depression itself is associated with significant cognitive degradation, particularly in executive functioning. While the exact degree of impairment from the instructor's incompletely controlled depression and his use of impairing medications at the time of the accident is impossible to determine, it is likely that there was some impairment in cognitive functioning as a result of his uncontrolled depression. Further, the instructor had sleep apnea, and that, combined with his recent use of sedating medications, chronic pain, and depression may well have contributed to his failure to take control of the airplane and conduct an emergency of-field landing after the partial loss of engine power.",

The purpose of the flight was to proceed to a nearby airport in order to refuel the aircraft prior to a longer flight back to its home base.  According to the private pilot in the left seat, after the engine was started, the after-market, panel-mounted, fuel management system/fuel flow meter indicated a \"Fuel Remaining\" of 235 pounds, and at that same point in time, the left main fuel tank gauge was at the top of the yellow arc (approximately 15 gallons), and the right main fuel tank gauge needle was at the bottom of the yellow arc (approximately empty). There was no operating restriction indicating the aircraft could not be operated in that fuel configuration.  Believing that there was adequate fuel for the flight, the PIC departed for what should have been a flight of ten minutes or less. After departure, a climbing right turn was made followed by the aircraft leveling off approximately 2,000 feet above the terrain, and soon thereafter the right fuel tank \"Fuel Low\" light came on. About one minute later the engine lost power. The PIC was not able to restart the engine, and therefore found it necessary to execute a forced landing in a wheat field located among hilly terrain. Because there were power lines at the approach end of the field, the PIC was not able to touch down until the aircraft was just past half-way down the field. Although the touchdown was successful, the PIC was unable to stop the aircraft before it exited the far end of the field and rolled/slid into a deep ravine. Subsequent inspections of the airframe, and an inspection/test run of the engine, revealed no system malfunctions. A post-accident review revealed that the aircraft's fuel system had been significantly modified during a major alteration that was never approved by the FAA. As part of the alteration, the route by which the excess fuel in the header tank was rerouted through the fuel system was significantly lengthened, and no approved flight tests had been performed to ensure that, after the alteration, adequate fuel would be supplied to the engine at all attitudes, power settings, fuel load totals, and fuel load distributions. It was also determined that, during the installation of the after-market fuel management system/fuel flow meter by an avionics shop, an incorrect calibration factor was entered in the unit, which would result in displaying an erroneous indication of the amount of fuel used by about 9 percent less than the actual amount.  With an unaltered fuel system, the aircraft should have arrived at its destination with about 11 minutes of fuel remaining, and because there were no major alteration-related amendments made to the Pilot\u2019s Operating Manual, the pilot had no way of knowing that the engine would lose power en route.",

All three landing gear were fracture-separated from the airplane during the accident sequence. The right and left main landing gear torque links exhibited different damage patterns. None of the attachment hardware for the left torque link knee joint was located. The lack of any landing gear operating anomalies during the accident flight\u2019s taxi, takeoff, gear retraction, and gear extension sequences, combined with the damage patterns to the left main landing gear torque links, were consistent with the knee joint attachment bolt being present through at least the beginning of the failure sequence on landing and with the bolt being at least partially installed during the landing. Further, the available evidence did not indicate that a pre-existing mechanical failure of the knee joint bolt had occurred. For the bolt to partially back out of its proper position, the retaining nut would have to be missing either due to the cotter key being lost as a result of mechanical failure or absent because it was never installed. If the cotter key was damaged or the nut was improperly torqued, it is possible that multiple taxi, takeoff, and landing cycles could have damaged and eventually caused the cotter key, the nut, or the bolt to fail, but no evidence was found to support that scenario.

The airline transport pilot and flight instructor were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local public use training flight. According to the flight instructor, prior to the last practice \"fulldown\" autorotation, they had performed two running landings, two stuck left pedal maneuvers, three stuck right pedal maneuvers, and eight successful autorotations. Just like the previous eight, the helicopter responded the same during the flare but this time it suddenly lost altitude and contacted the ground. The instructor \"quickly grabbed\" the controls and landed the helicopter which had yawed 90 degrees to the right. The airline transport pilot then asked him what happened.According to the airplane transport pilot (ATP), he was undergoing annual proficiency training, and after completing the simulated stuck pedal maneuvers, and run on landings, four straight in touchdown autorotations were performed, followed by 180 degree autorotations to touchdown.

He was at the target speed of approximately 60 knots indicated airspeed, and the rotor rpm was in the \"mid-green arc.\" The flare was initiated about 50 feet above ground level (agl) to arrest the forward motion as he had done on the previous autorotations but, at some point during the flare he felt a \"bump.\" The procedure was continued per the profile with the forward motion having been arrested, the helicopter was leveled off and a \"pitch pull\" was initiated, resulting in a \"normal\" touchdown with little forward motion, coming to rest turned to the right from its flight path by approximately 60 degrees.According to a witness, who was watching the helicopter doing autorotations, he \"took interest\" in this particular approach as the helicopter seemed to be \"falling a little more rapidly and aggressively\" then before. At approximately 100 feet agl, he then observed the helicopter \"nose up aggressively,\" the tail strike the ground, dirt being thrown upwards on to the top of the helicopter, and then it coming to rest with the main rotor still turning. A cursory examination of the helicopter revealed that the tail rotor blades exhibited impact damage and were twisted and bent. The tail rotor driveshaft was also twisted and bent, the horizontal stabilizer was bent, the forward and aft tail rotor drive shaft couplings were damaged, the tail rotor driveshaft dampener was distorted, and the tail rotor output shaft on the transmission was bent.",

The airplane climbed to about 400 feet but would not maintain altitude. There was no loss in engine power, and the airplane began to descend. The pilot executed a forced landing into a field, and the airplane collided with trees. After recovery of the airplane, the engine was removed and test run. No preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures were found that would have precluded normal engine operation. A review of the performance chart revealed that the airplane, in a clean configuration and at a maximum gross weight of 3,800 pounds, should have been able to maintain a rate of climb of 600 feet per minute at about 65 knots. The density altitude at the time of the accident was about 2,300 feet. Although the pilot estimated the gross weight was 3,695 pounds, postaccident weight and balance calculations revealed the estimated weight of the airplane at takeoff was 3,855 pounds, which was 55 pounds above the maximum allowable gross weight. High density altitude and increased gross weight both adversely affect an airplane's climb performance. The presence of either or both conditions requires pilot vigilance to maintain adequate airspeed during takeoff and climb. Aircraft performance can become marginal in high density altitude conditions, and it may be necessary to reduce aircraft gross weight for safe operations. It is likely that the high density altitude combined with operation over the airplane\u2019s maximum permitted takeoff gross weight resulted in the airplane's inability to climb or maintain altitude. These factors would both reduce the performance of the airplane.",

The engine-out audio warning sounded and segment lights illuminated. The pilot landed the helicopter and it skidded about 15 feet. A test run determined that the engine operated below the normal specifications for new engines. The pneumatic line from the power turbine governor was found to be leaking and was removed and sent to the NTSB's Materials Laboratory for further examination. That examination revealed superficial longitudinal tool marks that did not extend to the interior surfaces of the flared ends. The interior surface of the flared ends exhibited some localized fretting damage on one side, consistent with damage that could have been caused by inadequate torque at the connection; however, no other anomalies were noted.

He then taxied to runway 35 via taxiway A, taxiway D, across runway 26, to taxiway K.  Approximately 1 minute after the pilot of the MU-2 was cleared to taxi, the same ground controller cleared a maintenance tug towing an MD-80, to taxi from the same (northeast) ramp as the MU-2, to a ramp on the west side of runway 35.  The taxi clearance issued by the ground controller included a clearance for the tug to cross runway 35.  Once the MU-2 pilot arrived at the runway, he contacted the tower controller and was cleared for takeoff from runway 35.  The pilot initiated a takeoff, and as the airplane reached an airspeed of 80 knots, the pilot observed an aircraft tug crossing the runway centerline.  The pilot then aborted the takeoff, and maneuvered the airplane to the left side of the runway; however, the airplane contacted the tug at the intersection of runway 35 and taxiways \"Golf\" and \"Echo.\"  At the time of the accident, three full performance level air traffic controllers were working in the tower cab; a local controller (LCE), ground controller (GC), and clearance delivery controller.  The LCE and GC positions were located next to each other in the northeast corner of the tower cab.  FAA Air Traffic Control regulations required that a ground controller must obtain approval from a local controller before authorizing an aircraft or a vehicle to cross or use any portion of an active runway.

They diverted to a nearby airport. During the landing roll, the engine's thrust reversers were deployed. The right engine thrust reverser deploy light illuminated. The left engine thrust reverser deploy light did not illuminate. Maintenance personnel found the left engine lower thrust reverser door had been struck repeatedly by the top reverser door. An investigation revealed broken and bent thrust reverser linkages. A pivot bolt, washers, castellated nut, and cotterpin associated with a driver linkage arm were missing. Two other company airplanes were found with a missing cotterpin from the pivot bolt. Examination of these assemblies revealed the bolt end did not protrude beyond the nut's outer edge. The result was that the cotterpin could not fit through the hole in the bolt. The manufacturer's parts manual and maintenance manual text indicated that one countersunk washer should have been below the bolt head and one flat washer under the nut. However, the corresponding illustration in the maintenance manual showed an additional washer (2 washers) under the nut. ",

A factor relating to the accident was: the manufacturer's unclear information regarding the type and number of washers to be installed on the pivot bolt assembly. "

The landing gear was confirmed down and locked verbally by the student and instructor. The final approach was uneventful, but the touchdown point was long, and the airspeed was fast. Because of the extra speed on landing, the instructor elected to continue to the next runway exit beyond the one he planned to use. The student had initially applied the brakes evenly for the planned runway exit, but the instructor told him to continue to the next exit and to release the brakes to continue without stopping on the active runway. As the student released the brakes, the airplane began to yaw abruptly to the right. The student said that he was not applying any right brake pressure and that the instructor was not on the brakes.

The airplane also began experiencing intermittent electrical surges which caused the instrument panel lights, cabin lights, and radios to go off and on.  The pilot diverted to an alternate airport to land.  He did not secure the left engine before landing because it was still developing some usable power.  He placed the gear select handle in the down position and observed three green gear-down-and-locked lights.  Prior to touchdown, both power levers were positioned to flight idle and no gear warning horn sounded.  The airplane landed gear up.

The airplane had about 140 gallons of usable fuel aboard.  The flight's intended destination was located about 757 nautical miles away.  The pilot planned to make one stop in order to purchase fuel before continuing on to the destination airport.  As the accident flight progressed towards the intended fuel stop airport, the pilot requested to continue on to another airport located about 100 miles away, and closer to the final destination airport.  As the flight neared the second fuel stop airport, the pilot again made a request to the Air Traffic Control (ATC) specialist on duty, and said, in part: \"I'm going to change my destination ah...one more time, this will be the final time...\"  The flight was then cleared to the pilot's intended destination airport.  When the flight was about 22 miles southeast of the destination airport, the pilot informed the ATC specialist that he was concerned about his remaining fuel.  He stated, in part: \" ... I'm really low on fuel, and still 30 miles out.\"  When asked by the ATC specialist how much fuel he had remaining, the pilot responded by saying: \" Well... lets see, its very low... Below 5 gallons in both tanks.\"  The ATC specialist then informed the pilot of an alternate airport that was located closer to the flight's present position, but the pilot was not familiar with the airport, and he elected to proceed on.  Shortly thereafter, the pilot reported to the ATC specialist he was \"...out of gas, both engines.\"  The pilot selected a forced landing site located about 12 miles short of his intended destination airport, in open ocean waters. According to the two surviving passengers, after the collision with the water, all of the airplane's occupants lost consciousness momentarily.  When the two survivors regained consciousness, there was about 2 feet of water in the airplane, and the airplane was sinking. The survivors said four of the six occupants successfully evacuated the airplane into the water. They added that the pilot was one of the four occupants who exited the sinking airplane.  The two remaining occupants remained inside the airplane as it sank.  The four survivors then began to swim to the closest shoreline, located about 1 mile from the accident site.

The certified private pilot was not injured, while the sole passenger received serious injuries. The airplane was registered to Aero Services LLC, Centerville, Utah, and operated by Bountiful Flight, Woods Cross, Utah. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal cross-country flight, which was operated in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and a flight plan was not filed. The flight departed the Logan-Cache Airport (LUG), Logan, Utah, with the planned destination being Sky Park Airport (BTF), Bountiful, Utah.In a statement submitted to the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, the pilot reported that about 15 miles north of BTF the engine rpm started dropping off from 2,400 rpm, and the airspeed was decreasing from 80 mph. The pilot stated that he then began using emergency procedures to restore engine rpm; rich mixture, add carburetor heat, and  pump throttle lever, but he was not able to restore engine power. The pilot then elected to make an emergency landing to a golf course. During the approach and landing sequence the pilot intentionally impacted a tree with the airplane's right wing to reduce speed. The airplane subsequently came to rest inverted in a sand trap on the golf course.The airplane was recovered to a secured storage facility for further examination.",

Witnesses reported that shortly after takeoff, the airplane banked sharply to the left, then it seemed to momentarily stabilize and commence a climb before beginning to roll to the left again. The airplane rolled to an inverted position, entered a dive, collided with the airport terminal building and exploded on impact. The entire airplane sustained severe fire and impact damage.  Examination of the engines and propellers revealed no evidence of any discrepancies that would preclude normal operation. All the propeller blades displayed signatures indicative of high rotational energy at the time of impact, indicating that both propellers were rotating, not feathered, and the engines were operating at high power at the time of impact. Components of the autopilot system, specifically the pitch servo assembly and a portion of the roll servo assembly, were identified in the wreckage. The portion of the roll servo assembly found remained attached to a piece of skin torn from the airframe and consisted of the mounting bracket for the roll servo with the capstan bolted to the bracket, clearly indicating that this component had been reinstalled and strongly suggesting that the pilot reinstalled/reactivated all of the removed autopilot components the day before the accident. Maintenance personnel started an annual inspection on the airplane the month prior to the accident and found an autopilot installed in the airplane without the proper paperwork. The pilot explained to them that he designed and built the autopilot and was in the process of getting the proper paperwork for the installation of the system in his airplane. During the inspection, a mechanic found the aileron cable rubbing on the autopilot's roll servo capstan so the mechanic removed the roll servo along with the capstan. Additionally, mechanics disabled the autopilot's pitch servo and removed the autopilot control head. They were in the process of completing the inspection when the pilot asked for the airplane stating that he needed it for a trip. The pilot also asked that the airplane be returned to him without the interior installed. Two days before the accident, the airplane was returned to the pilot with the annual inspection incomplete. The autopilot control head, roll servo and capstan were returned to the pilot in a cardboard box on this date. A friend of the pilot reported that the day before the accident, the pilot completed reinstalling the seats and \"other things\" in order to fly the airplane the next day.

During takeoff, the pilot noted that the cockpit gauges were in the green range an indication that the helicopter had enough power available for the weight and density altitude he was operating. The pilot began herding operation, by maneuvering behind a small group of animals and successfully directing them toward the trap configured on the ground. After about 20 minutes, a large group of pronghorn were found and again the pilot maneuvered the helicopter behind them in an effort to herd them toward the trap's funnel. The animals suddenly reversed course and ran directly under the helicopter. In response, the pilot maneuvered the helicopter backward about 50 to 100 feet while applying forward cyclic and maintaining an altitude of about 15 feet above ground level.

There was a \"notable\" amount of carbon build-up in the area around the crack. According to a maintenance representative, failure of the tube in flight would have resulted in a \"significant reduction in fuel scheduling which could result in an engine flameout.\" An attempt to restart the engine in flight would \"likely have failed,\" however; an attempt would have accounted for the \"notable\" amount of carbon build-up around the break in the tube. No other aircraft anomalies were noted.",

Winds were reported by the pilot as variable and gusting.  The pilot stated that during the third touch-and-go, the wind shifted to a crosswind with a tailwind component. While reconfiguring for takeoff, the pilot perceived a faster than normal groundspeed.  A gust of wind contacted the airplane's tail pushing the nose to the left.  The pilot attempted to correct back to centerline but was hesitant to input an aggressive correction due to the faster than normal groundspeed.  The left main gear ran off the runway onto the grass and the airplane departed the left side of the runway.  The nose gear sank into mud and was separated.  The nose gear strut dug into the muddy terrain and the airplane nosed over coming to rest in the inverted position.

The airplane subsequently departed the left side of the runway and came to rest approximately 1,250 feet from the approach end.  A skid mark began about 400 feet from the end of the runway.  The mark was left of the runway centerline and began as a straight skid mark.  It then transitioned to a weaving or wavy pattern.  The wavy pattern was approximately 60 feet long.  Examination of the airframe revealed that the left main landing gear torque links had separated at the center hinge point and the wheel assembly was rotated 180 degrees.  The washers installed under the bolt head at the pivot hinge did not conform to the washers specified by the airframe manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletin.  The installed washer outside diameter measured approximately 0.560 inch.  The through hole in the torque links measured 0.562 inch.  Washers with an outside diameter of 0.750 inch were specified.  The undersized washers allowed the bolt and bushing stack-up to pull through the upper torque link.  The lower landing gear strut and wheel assembly were then free to rotate out of alignment with the upper strut.

The pilot rolled the aircraft to a steep bank angle to enter a base leg and then a final leg. The aircraft overshot the final approach course and the pilot continued to use a steep bank in an attempt to get onto final. As the aircraft approached the final course it rolled rapidly to an inverted position and crashed on a street. The engine was heard to accelerate just prior to impact. Post-crash examination of the engine, propeller, and engine fuel system showed no evidence of pre-crash mechanical failure or malfunction. The electric fuel boost pump switch was found in the on position after the accident. The pump did not operate after the accident. An examination of the pump revealed that the negative power wire had been pulled from the pump motor and was missing. A replacement wire was installed and the motor operated normally.

The manufacturer of the pump reported that the incorrect O-ring would result in the engine-driven fuel pump drawing air into the engine fuel system.

While holding, the pilot noted calm wind on the surface and wind gusts of up to 40 knots in turbulence aloft. After holding for about 15 minutes, the pilot decided to execute the instrument approach. While descending to the final approach fix, the airplane slowed, the turbulence worsened, and the autopilot disengaged.

The private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local, personal flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.  The pilot performed a preflight inspection of the airplane before departing on the local flight with the intent of practicing touch-and-go landings. The first two landings were uneventful. The pilot landed the airplane in a \"three point full stall\" attitude during the third landing. During the landing roll, and just before the pilot intended to increase engine power to take off, he felt a vibration originating from the tailwheel that was increasing rapidly in intensity. The airplane then suddenly veered to the left. The pilot attempted to compensate by applying full rudder to the right, but the airplane continued left, departed the runway, and struck a taxiway sign. The airplane subsequently pitched forward and the nose struck the ground, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage.Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors examined the airplane following the accident and noted the tailwheel steering linkage was disconnected from the rudder arm. One of the two springs attaching the tailwheel and the rudder arm remained attached to the tailwheel, while the other spring was not attached, and had been recovered by the pilot from the accident site. The associated hardware used to attach the spring to the rudder arm was not recovered.",

The bins were lifted from a flatbed trailer, about 4 feet from a ground crewmember, a 9-year hook-up veteran. After the fifth lift, the ground crewmember attempted to run to, and help a truck driver of another trailer. Although he had a hard hat with a combination ear muffs/radio receiver and microphone, the ground crewmember did not advise the pilot of his intentions, and ran under the track flown during the previous four loads. As the helicopter flew over the ground crewmember, the cargo hook opened, uncommanded by the pilot, and the bins fell about 8 feet onto the ground crewmember. The cargo hook system had been removed from another helicopter in 2002, and that helicopter had previously had it installed at a completion center in 1997. The hook release cable, Bell part number 206-072-903-101 was installed; however, the correct part number was 206-072-903-1, which was approximately 1 inch longer, and would have allowed enough slack to normally preclude any tension on the cargo hook manual release mechanism.

At 0325, the pilot issued a \"Mayday.\"  On final approach the airplane struck a building and wires about 1/2 mile short of the runway.  Witnesses that saw the airplane just before impact said that the airplane was low, there was no in-flight fire, and the engine sounds \"...appeared to be a fluttering sound as if air [was] passing through the propeller.\"  The pilot had filed for a cruise altitude of 15,000 feet, with a time en route of 5 hours, and fuel on board 6 hours.  Weight and balance calculations showed that the pilot was operating about 722 pounds above the maximum gross weight for the takeoff, climb, and maximum cruise power settings.   The Pilot Operating Handbook calculations showed that most of the fuel would have been used during the flight.  The engine and propeller examinations revealed that both engines were not producing power at impact (windmilling).  There were no discrepancies found with the engines or propellers.  Examination of the propellers revealed that they were not in the feather position and they were not in beta/reverse position.  Line personnel at the departure airport confirmed that all the tanks were topped off (282 gallons added).  It took the flight 32 minutes to reach a cruise altitude of 15,000 feet, which calculated to about 293.3 pounds (1 gallon of Jet \"A\" equals 6.7 pounds), and a flight time of 4.9 hours from takeoff to impact.  Sample calculations indicated that the fuel burn rate would have caused the airplane to use 2,649.3 pounds of Jet \"A\" turbine fuel during the flight.  The flight departed with all tanks full 384 gallons usable (2,572.8 pounds), which calculates to insufficient fuel for the completion of the flight.  Two gallons of fuel was drained from the right nacelle tank at the crash site, and there was no evidence of in-flight leakage.  The sample calculations do not consider performance degradation for operating the airplane above the maximum allowable gross weight, which would cause the fuel consumption to go up because more power was required for the over weight conditions.  The pilot's flight plan was for economy cruise, plus the airplane was over gross weight at takeoff, and there are no performance charts for that condition.  So, the performance was even poorer than shown on the maximum power chart for climb and cruise.  Calculations of the maximum allowable fuel that could be on board the aircraft showed that only 1851 pounds of turbine fuel could be carried to start the flight at the maximum allowable weight, or about 3.2 hours of flight.  The en route winds aloft at the airplane's altitude indicated a slight tailwind for half the flight and a headwind of about 15 knots for the remainder of the flight.",
            "probable_cause": "a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.  Contributing factors in this accident were the pilot's operation of the airplane in an overweight condition, inadequate pre-flight and in-flight planning. "

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The aerobatic airplane was destroyed when it impacted terrain following the in-flight separation of its left wing.  The airplane was observed traveling southeast, at the bottom of an established aerobatic box (1,500 feet msl), when the left wing separated from the airplane.  The wing spar failed in upward bending, as indicated by the flat compressive failure zones near the upper surfaces of the spar caps and the fibrous tensile fractures near the bottom surfaces of the spar caps.  Both spar caps showed the same type of bending failure, which suggests that the shear web interconnection between the spar caps failed before the final failure of the spar caps themselves.  The failure was almost certainly initiated by the progressive compressive failure zone at the top surface of the upper spar cap, which was visible as a band of lighter color on the fracture surface extending approximately 12 mm to 15 mm from the top surface of the spar cap (through the top layer and part of the second layer of spruce in the spar cap).  The discoloration and/or material loss at the upper forward corner of the fuselage piece of the spar could have played a role in the failure of the shear web, but the discoloration and damage is more likely a result of impact with the ground.  The materials used in the spar construction were as specified, and the adhesive bonds used in the construction and previous repair were sound.  There is a long history of ADs and SBs requiring inspections for compressive crack-like features on the top surface of the spar.  The representatives from the DGAC and BEA indicated that the first accident resulting from this type of progressive compressive damage occurred in 1968, and that there had been approximately 10 similar failures in total.  A significant portion of the upper spar cap of the accident aircraft was replaced in 1980 as a result of an inspection detecting such damage. It appears from the maintenance records that the appropriate ADs and SBs were signed off as having been complied with in the time since 1980, but the compressive damage that led to the accident was not detected.  It appears that the position of the inspection opening on the left wing was not strictly in keeping with the instructions with SB 16, but there are other problems with the structure and the inspection procedures.  The highest compressive stresses would occur at the top of the spar, just at the outboard edge of the fuselage attachment reinforcement block, which is where the fracture occurred.  This location also coincided closely with the edge of the wing-walk support, which would further increase the stress concentrations in the area.  Furthermore, the upper spar caps were damaged during preparation of the inspection openings, leaving small steps in the spar cap material at the edges of the wing-walk supports. These steps would cause additional stress concentrations, making progressive damage more likely (particularly as the step sat almost directly above the outboard edge of the fuselage attachment reinforcement block).  The steps probably also obscured the appearance of the crack-like features that formed at the base of the step.  The step on the right wing was much smaller than that on the left wing, and the right wing had only a small area of progressive compressive damage compared to the damage on the left wing.  Based on the circumstances of this accident, there are several problems with the service bulletins intended to prevent such failures.  The position of the inspection opening is described in relation to rib 1, but this position is unreliable.  Of interest is the top surface of the spar at the location above the edge of the fuselage attachment reinforcement block.  Once the box beam has been completely assembled, the reinforcement block is no longer visible and the position of rib 1 may not correlate with the edge of the block, particularly after a modification or repair involving rib 1. In addition, the SBs do not address the location of the wing-walk support. In this case, the wing-walk support appears to have possibly limited the size of the inspection opening, led to an additional stress concentration in precisely the wrong place, and obscured the progressive damage.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the left wing, which resulted from progressive compressive fractures in the upper wooden spar cap.  Contributing the accident was the difficulty in performing adequate inspections of the spar caps in an attempt to detect the compressive fractures."

Several days before the flight the #1 thrust reverser had been rendered inoperative and mechanically locked in the stowed position by maintenance personnel.  In accordance with approved minimum equipment list (MEL) procedures, the airplane was allowed to continue in service with a conspicuous placard noting the inoperative status of the #1 reverser placed next to the engine's thrust lever.  When this crew picked up the airplane at the departure airport, the inbound crew briefed the captain on the status of the #1 thrust reverser.  The captain was the flying pilot for this leg of the flight and the airplane touched down on the centerline of the runway about 1,200 feet beyond its threshold.  The captain moved both thrust levers into the reverse position and the airplane began yawing right.  In an effort at maintaining directional control, the captain then moved the #1 thrust lever out of reverse and inadvertently moved it to the Take-Off/Go-Around (TOGA) position, while leaving the #2 thrust lever in the full reverse position.  The thrust asymmetry created by the left engine at TOGA power with the right engine in full reverse greatly increased the right yaw forces, and they were not adequately compensated for by the crew's application of rudder and brake inputs.  Upon veering off the side of the runway onto the dirt infield, the nose gear strut collapsed.  The airplane slid to a stop in a nose down pitch attitude, about 7,650 feet from the threshold.  There was no fire.  Company procedures required the flying pilot (the captain) to give an approach and landing briefing to the nonflying pilot (first officer).  The captain did not brief the first officer regarding the thrust reverser's MEL'd status, nor was he specifically required to do so by the company operations manual.  Also, the first officer did not remind the captain of its status, nor was there a specific requirement to do so.  The operations manual did state that the approach briefing should include, among other things, \"the landing flap setting...target airspeed...autobrake level (if desired) consistent with runway length, desired stopping distance, and any special problems.\"  The airline's crew resource management procedures tasked the nonflying pilot to be supportive of the flying pilot and backup his performance if pertinent items were omitted from the approach briefing.  The maintenance, repair history, and functionality of various components associated with the airplane's directional control systems were evaluated, including the brake system, the nose landing gear strut and wheels, the brakes, the antiskid system, the thrust levers and reversers, and the throttle control unit.  No discrepancies were found regarding these components.",

(MU values range from 0 and 100, where 0 is the lowest friction value and 100 is the maximum friction value. A MU value of 40 or less is the level at which aircraft braking performance starts to deteriorate and directional control begins to be less responsive.) Dispatch personnel later reported that the conditions had improved and that the crew was released for the flight. While en route, the crew monitored weather and runway conditions at the destination airport and calculated the required landing distances, which they found to be within acceptable limits for the reported MU values of 41, 37, and 36. About 10 minutes before landing, MU values were reported as 40, 42, and 40, with patchy thin snow over patchy thin packed snow and ice on the runway surface. The flight crew received these MU values, continued their approach to the airport, and landed. During the landing roll, thrust reversers were deployed, and the crew noted that all of the ground and air slat indication lights were green and that the anti-skid system began to pulse; however, the airplane was not slowing down. Despite the application of maximum thrust reverse, there was no effect on slowing the airplane, and it exited the departure end of the 6,300-foot runway and came to rest just beyond the blast pad. The flight crew reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.  About 7 minutes after the runway overrun, MU values were recorded as 34, 33, and 23. As indicated by the MU values reported just prior to landing, and the lower values reported shortly after landing, the landing was made at a time when the runway conditions were deteriorating, and the braking performance was becoming less effective.",

The gear handle was then moved to the down position and the crew received an error message of a fault for the nose wheel steering (WHEEL N/W STRG FAULT).  After determining that the nose landing gear was cocked 90 degrees, the crew landed at an alternate airport, and the NLG tires and both wheels were worn down into the axle.  Post incident examination of the nose gear assembly found that two of the four anti-rotation lugs on the NLG upper support assembly fractured and separated due to induced fatigue from the stearing system's programed pre-landing dynamic steering tests that repeatedly cycles pressure to the stearing cylinders.  The failed lugs allowed the NLG to deviate from its 0-degree position in the landing gear bay upon gear retraction on takeoff.  This resulted in the L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT error message on the ECAM system.  When the pilots extended the incident airplane's landing gear, the nose gear achieved the down and locked position 1.5 seconds before the main gear and/or all of the landing gear doors closed.  The nose wheel assembly was not centered at this time.  The Brake Steering Control Unit (BSCU) detected this off center condition of the NLG and attempted to re-center the nose wheel; however, due to the sequencing of the nose and main landing gear and their respective doors, hydraulic pressure was shut off to the NLG steering valve.  This lack of hydraulic power to the servo valve resulted in a lack of position feedback to the BSCU. After a 0.5-second monitoring time period, the BSCU detected this as a fault and deactivated the steering system so that the BSCU could not return the nose wheels to center.  Failure of the nosewheels to center initiated a WHEEL N/W STRG FAULT caution message on the ECAM.  There were no approved procedures that allowed the flight crew to attempt to reset the BSCU system, which would have re-enabled the hydraulic system and could have resulted in the system recentering the nose wheels.",

A contributing factor was the design of the Brake Steering Control Unit (BSCU) system logic, which prevented the nosewheels from centering. Also contributing was the lack of a procedure to attempt to reset the BSCU system under these conditions."

During one of the landings, the airplane veered off to the left side of the runway, and struck shrubbery.  The flight instructor stated that he included a 10-knot wind restriction when he endorsed the student pilot's logbook for solo privileges.  The flight instructor was present during the accident flight.  He did not obtain a weather briefing, but stated that the wind socks indicated the wind was less than 10 knots.  At an airport approximately 10 miles southwest of the accident site, the reported winds were from 350 degrees at 18 knots, gusting to 23 knots. ",
