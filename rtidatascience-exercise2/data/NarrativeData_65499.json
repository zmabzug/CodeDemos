The airplane was observed to approach for the banner pick-up. A witness indicated the approach and pick-up appeared normal. After the banner hook-up, the pilot initiated a climb attitude. Seconds into the climb, the airplane was observed in a steep nose up attitude. Subsequently, the airplane collided with the ground several hundred feet northeast of the banner pickup point in a nose down attitude. The eyewitness also stated that the engine continued to run throughout the maneuver. The airframe damage was typical of a stall impact. The 2nd pilot was a contract sales person for the banner tow operation, but was not cleared as a banner tow pilot. The aircraft's maximum certificated gross weight was 1600 pounds. The actual gross weight at takeoff was calculated to be 1647 pounds. The banner weighed 35 pounds. Examination of the airframe and engine assembly failed to disclose a mechanical malfunction or a component failure. ",

He was performing slow-flight maneuvers, and because the airplane was already configured, the instructor suggested he perform a power-off stall. The pilot reduced power to idle, and as the airspeed decreased, he increased the pitch attitude to induce a stall. At the onset of the stall, the pilot added power, the airplane yawed left, and \u201csnapped\" into a tight spin to the left. The instructor announced that she had the flight controls, and the pilot released them. The instructor verbalized her spin recovery control inputs as she performed them, but the airplane continued to spin and lose altitude. The airplane eventually stopped spinning, and during the post-spin dive recovery, the airplane struck trees and terrain, and came to rest inverted.A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the airplane's airspeed indicator's color code range markings were inaccurate and did not agree with the information published in the supplied airplane manufacturer's Pilot Operating Handbook (POH). Depending on the configuration of the airplane, the difference between the published indicated airspeed and the published calibrated airspeeds was as much as 20 knots. The indicated airspeed is an important value for the pilot as it directly indicates stall speed and various airframe structurally limited speeds, regardless of density altitude. If the pilot is receiving inaccurate information from the airspeed indicator, the airplane may stall at a higher airspeed than the pilot is anticipating. The airplane also experienced a previous accident in which the improperly marked airspeed indicator contributed to the accident. While the airplane manufacturer agreed to make changes to the POH after that accident, those changes were not complete and the accident report was not published prior to this accident.",

As the flight approached Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey, the pilots received the current automated terminal information service data, which included visibility 2 miles in light rain and mist, ceiling 800 feet broken, and wind from 360 degrees at 6 knots, gusting to 16 knots. The pilots programmed the flight management system with the current data, which provided a reference speed (ref) of 136 knots. The approach was briefed and the PIC elected to add 10 knots to the Vref speed due to the wind conditions. The flight descended on a localizer approach for runway 6, a 6,013-foot-long, 150-foot wide, grooved asphalt runway. The autopilot was disconnected after the airplane descended through 1,000 feet mean sea level (msl) at Vref plus 10 knots. As the airplane descended through 700 feet msl, the copilot obtained a wind check from the tower controller, which indicated the wind was from 010 degrees at 15 knots, gusting to 25 knots. FDR data indicate that the airspeed slowed from Vref plus 10 knots to Vref, and the PIC disconnected the autothrottles about 645 feet msl, in an attempt to manually control the throttles and regain airspeed. The airspeed then fluctuated from Vref plus 5 knots to Vref plus 15 knots. The copilot made airspeed callouts throughout the approach, which included Vref plus 15 as the airplane descended through 200 feet and Vref plus 15 again as the airplane was 40 feet above the runway. The airplane descended into ground effect at 150 to 160 knots, floated and bounced, before finally touching down with approximately 2,250 feet of runway remaining (as captured in airport surveillance video). The thrust reversers were timely deployed by the captain and operated correctly. The ground spoilers, brakes, and anti-skid system also operated correctly when automatically deployed; however, the airplane traveled off the end of the runway about 40 to 50 knots and came to rest 100 feet into an engineered materials arresting system. There was no mention of a go-around by either pilot during the flight. According to the PIC's written statement, the airplane was at Vref speed, just prior to touchdown, when a gust of wind caused it to float. He further stated that at no point did either pilot believe there was not adequate runway remaining to continue the landing. After touchdown, at 80 knots, the PIC and copilot continued to believe the airplane would stop on the remaining runway; however, the airplane had floated about 65 percent of the length of the runway before touching down. During a subsequent telephone interview, the PIC remarked that a Vref plus 15 callout by the copilot, at 50 feet above the runway, would have been cause for an immediate go around; yet neither pilot called for one during the flight. According to the copilot's written statement, it was not apparent to him that the airplane might not stop on the runway until 400 to 500 feet before the end of the runway, when maximum braking and anti-skid were operating. Data from the airplane manufacturer, for the estimated landing weight, revealed the airplane required a landing distance of approximately 2,820 feet on a dry runway, or 3,600 feet on a wet runway, without wind factored. Runway 1 at TEB is 7,000 feet long but does not have an instrument approach due to the proximity of Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) airspace (EWR is 10 miles southwest of TEB and has runways in excess of 10,000 feet). The approach to runway 6 has a circling approach to runway 1; however, at the time of the incident, the ceiling was below the circling approach minimums. The pilots could have remained airborne in a holding pattern a few minutes to evaluate whether the ceiling would lift sufficiently to fly the circling approach to the longer runway, they could have diverted to EWR, or they could have initiated a go-around to land on runway 6 when airspeed became excessive. Instead, they continued an unstabilized approach in gusting crosswind conditions and failed to initiate a go around when airspeed at the end of the approach became excessive.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command's failure to attain the proper touchdown point while landing with a gusting crosswind and failure to initiate a go-around, which resulted in a landing more than halfway down the runway and a subsequent runway overrun. Contributing to the incident was the failure of either pilot to call for a go-around when the airplane was at Vref plus 15 at 50 feet above the runway or once they had floated well beyond the touchdown zone of the runway."

Air traffic control provided a vector to the nearest airport, about 8 miles north of the airplane's position.  About 7 miles from the airport, at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet, the pilot reported that he was not going to reach the airport.  The airplane subsequently impacted terrain about 6 miles from the airport.

Several witnesses near the crash site heard an airplane overfly their homes at a low altitude.  They reported that the engine was operating as it flew overhead, then they heard the engine stop followed by a 'thud.'  According to the witnesses, it was cloudy, and the fog had covered the tops of the 50 foot tall trees.  The flight followed the successful completion of a visual flight rules (VFR) cross country flying event.  According to the Chairperson of the U.S. Air Race, Inc., the event organizers terminated the daylight and VFR-only event early because weather conditions did not appear to permit a VFR flight to FDK.  Several VFR aircraft landed short of FDK and drove the remaining distance.  According to Air Traffic Control records the pilot did not file a flight plan.  An Air Traffic Controller said, '...Aircraft were canceling their [instrument flight rules] IFR either after landing or short final which caused other inbounds to hold or get delaying vectors.'.  AIRMET SIERRA update number 5 issued at 1545, and was current for mountain obscuration and IFR ceilings and visibility's over the accident location.

            "narrative": "On April 20, 2015, about 1440 eastern daylight time, a Mooney M20TN, N608MR, was substantially damaged during a forced landing following a total loss of engine power while on final approach to Lakeland Linder Regional Airport (LAL), Lakeland, Florida. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument rules flight plan was filed. The commercial pilot sustained serious injuries. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight had departed from the Stuart Airport (SUA), Stuart, Florida, about 1340.The airplane was removed prior to the investigative team's arrival; however, photographs provided to the investigative team revealed that the airplane came to rest near the aft end of a boat, that was on a trailer. The airplane forward of the aft baggage compartment bulkhead, was engulfed in flames. A video, taken by the pilot immediately after exiting the airplane, revealed fire beginning predominately forward of the wings but engulfing the wings within a few seconds of the start of the recording. The accident flight path was oriented on a 060 degree heading and the debris path began with three tire marks, approximately 20 feet in length and 200 feet to the west of the main wreckage resting point. The airplane became airborne, impacted a palm tree about 5 feet agl, as evidenced by an imbedded pitot tube in the tree trunk, impacted an archway over an entrance gate that was about 15 feet in height, struck another palm tree, and then impacted the ground coming to rest on an approximate heading of 260 degrees. The accident location was about 6,100 feet and 76 degrees from the runway 27 threshold, the intended landing runway.According to the pilot, he had been vectored around some weather and was at 2000 feet above mean sea level (msl). He was given clearance to descend to 1600 feet msl and was placed on the final approach course at the final approach fix for the RNAV runway 27 approach. In order to configure for landing he reduced the power, extended the landing gear, and extended the flaps to the 33 degree flap setting. Once he was established at his planned approach speed, he utilized the veneer knob, on the throttle, to add power; however, the engine failed to respond. He then utilized the throttle lever and applied full power; however, the engine did not respond. He switched fuel tanks, checked his magneto switch, and fuel pump in an attempt to get the engine to respond; however, none were successful. Due to his configuration he elected to make an off airport landing and turned the airplane to the right, towards a vacant field. He further stated that the time from the first attempt to apply power and the accident was less than a minute.Postrecovery examination revealed that the airplane was thermally damaged forward of the baggage compartment aft bulkhead. Impact damage was consistent with the airplane impacting the ground in a right wing, nose down attitude. The left wing was segmented into three sections and the right wing was segmented into two sections about midspan. Examination of the propeller blades revealed that the engine was not under power at the time of the impact and that the propeller was most likely windmilling. Examination of the fuel vents revealed that there was no obstruction to the fuel venting system. Examination of the engine revealed crankshaft and camshaft continuity from the propeller flange to the rear accessory pad, and thumb compression was noted on all cylinders, except for Cylinder No. 5 which had sustained impact damage.A fuel receipt located at a fixed base operator at SUA revealed that, on the morning of the accident, the airplane was fueled with 20 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel. According to the pilot, the 20 gallons was a \"top off\" and would have provided him with full fuel tanks.The engine was retained for further examination.",

The instructor pilot recycled the landing gear, which continued to fail to lock in the extended position.  The pilot returned to the airport and executed a low approach over the runway where tower personnel advised them that the landing gear appeared to be down. The crew decided to attempt a landing with the unsafe landing gear indication. After touchdown, the main landing gear partially collapsed, while the nose gear remained extended.  A previous incident similar to the accident occurred 14 weeks before.  During that event, the flight crew manually extended the gear per the prescribed procedures and made a successful landing.  During the accident event, the flight crew did not attempt to manually lower the landing gear as directed in the (checklist).

The pilot stated that during descent, both engines 'stopped like fuel starvation.'  The airplane was maneuvered for a forced landing on a highway, but due to traffic, a railroad right-of-way was selected. During a wheels-up landing, the right wingtip collided with a boulder. The right wing auxillary fuel tank was compromised, and the fuel line separated from the right tip (main) tank, but there was no physical evidence of fuel at the site. About 1 pint of fuel remained in the right main tank; the left main tank was empty. Both fuel selectors were set for the main tanks. During test runs, the left engine rotated, but was not run due to a fuel leak ('O' ring) at the throttle body. The right engine would only run when an external fuel boost pump was 'ON.' An 'O' ring fuel leak was observed at the engine fuel pump, and the pump exhibited a fuel stain from seepage. The fuel pump and the metering unit (after replacing the 'O' ring) flowed within specifications.

During a cellular telephone conversation with his employer, it was decided that the pilot should reverse course, land at a nearby airport, or return to the helicopter's base. The pilot took off from the field and attempted to fly directly to an airport, but was again unable to follow his desired course due to weather. As he maneuvered, the weather improved, the ridgelines were visible, and the pilot was able to fly \"about 100 feet above the trees, and 200 feet below the clouds\" as he approached a field that was crossed by a power line. The pilot said he chose to land in the field because of a \"klunking\" noise behind him. \"As I entered the approach the noise got worse and the aircraft started to vibrate. The vibrations got very bad as I tried to arrest my descent, so I decided that touching down hard was better than shaking apart.\" Examination of the global positioning system ground track revealed that the helicopter descended at a rate of 1,000 feet per minute during an s-turn across the face of a mountain before it leveled over flat terrain, and slowed below effective translational lift, in the vicinity of the crash site. The crash site was surrounded by rising terrain, in the lee of a mountain with strong winds, and an AIRMET for turbulence was in effect along the route of flight. The helicopter experienced a high sink rate and high levels of vibration prior to ground contact. According to The Good Aviation Practices publication Helicopter Performance, published by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (November 2002), \"Local terrain, trees, and buildings all influence the flow of wind near them. The mechanical turbulence resulting from this disturbed airflow may become very marked in the lee of the obstruction.

Additionally, the horizon is less visible and less distinct at night than during the day.  Because the pilot was descending the airplane over rural, mountainous terrain that provided few visual ground reference cues, and because the overcast cloud layer would have prevented moonlight from illuminating the terrain, it is likely that the pilot did not see the rising terrain as the airplane continued toward it.  The airplane was equipped with an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System; however, impact damage to the unit precluded post accident testing.  It is not known how the unit was configured during the flight or what type of alerts the pilot received prior to impact.  Post accident examination of the wreckage, to include both engines, did not disclose evidence of a mechanical malfunction prior to impact.  Additionally, no evidence was found to suggest an in-flight structural failure.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate altitude and descent rate during a night visual approach.  Dark night conditions and mountainous terrain are factors in the accident."

The elevator trim actuator was found in the full tab-up or airplane nose-down position after the accident. The flight was the second flight of the day and was the fourth in a series of maintenance acceptance flights after the installation of a new avionics suite and a new autopilot system. Before the accident flight, all of the features of the autopilot system tested satisfactorily on the ground but did not yet function as designed in flight, as the airplane demonstrated a pitch-porpoise tendency when the altitude hold feature was engaged. According to the technician who performed the installation and troubleshooting work on the airplane, he had accompanied the pilot on the first flight that day and had spoken to an autopilot manufacturing representative upon their return. Another troubleshooting procedure was performed, the technician left for lunch, and the pilot departed alone on the accident flight. When describing a previous test flight, the technician stated that the pilot worked the yoke against the autopilot, and, in response, the autopilot ran the elevator trim to the full nose-down position. The pilot responded by swiping both panel-mounted master switches to the off position (autopilot on/off switch and the trim on/off switch) then attempting to trim the airplane with the electric trim that he had just disabled. According to the technician, the pilot yelled at him to turn the system off, and the technician responded that it was off. He said that the pilot\u2019s actions scared him and demonstrated to him that the pilot really didn't have control of the airplane. He noted that, \"After the flight, I told [the pilot] he needed to go back and get in the books and learn to operate the system. He seemed very disoriented with the new technology on this flight and previous flights.\"Based on the available evidence, it is likely that, after autopilot engagement, the airplane pitched down as a first action of the pitch porpoise, which may have still existed as a discrepancy in the autopilot operation. In response to the downward movement of the airplane, the pilot likely pulled back on the yoke in an effort to arrest the airplane's descent. As a result, the autopilot would have commanded the trim further toward the nose-down position. Such a scenario would require a greater and ever-increasing physical effort by the pilot to overcome the growing aerodynamic force that would result from the nose-down pitch and increasing speed of the airplane. The pilot may have removed one hand from the yoke to again reach for the panel-mounted trim and/or autopilot master switches. With that action, discounting any physical problem, he may have lost his single-handed grip on the control yoke, and the airplane descended in an unrecoverable nose-down attitude.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper response to a known autopilot pitch divergence anomaly. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to perform a test flight on a system for which he lacked a complete working knowledge."

During the  attempted takeoff from an open field with 8-inch tall grass, the airplane did not seem to have sufficient lift and, although the engine was at full power, the airplane would not climb more than 20 feet above ground level. The airplane cleared the fence, but the pilot then realized that the airplane was not going to be able to clear the 60-foot-tall trees located about 650 feet from the fence.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.A witness familiar with the pilot reported that the accident flight was the pilot\u2019s second flight\u00a0to the airport that day to transport ceramic tiles to that location. One witness reported that the airplane appeared to be \u201ctaking off attempting to recover [from] an aborted landing and did not have the airspeed to recover.\u201d Several witnesses observed the airplane having difficulty climbing before it impacted water in a left-wing-low attitude. Based on the witness statements, the pilot was likely performing a go-around maneuver before the accident, and the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall. The airplane came to rest on its left side in about 8 ft of water and 200 yards from the departure end of the intended runway. Several witnesses reported hearing the engine operating with no hesitations noted, and postrecovery examination revealed no mechanical malfunctions or abnormalities of the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.During the examination, 666 lbs of ceramic tiles were found unsecured in the cargo compartment; this exceeded the cargo compartment weight limit by 57 lbs and would have degraded the airplane\u2019s climb performance and increased its stall speed. The investigation could not determine the actual distribution of the unsecured tiles in the cargo compartment before the accident, so postaccident weight and balance calculations were performed for several tile distribution scenarios. The calculations revealed that, with a relatively even distribution or with the tiles in the forward position of the cargo compartment, the center of gravity (CG) would have been within the CG envelope limits; with the tiles in the forward position, the CG would have been near its forward limit. However, with the tiles in the aft position, the CG could have exceeded the aft CG limit by as much as about 4 inches. \u000b\u000bBased on the evidence, it is likely that, during the approach to land, the unsecured tiles began to slide forward, which would have made the airplane\u2019s nose feel heavy and might have led to the pilot\u2019s decision to go around. However, when the pilot applied power and began to pitch the airplane\u2019s nose up during the go-around, it is likely that the unsecured tiles slid aft, which resulted in the CG exceeding its aft limit, the airplane\u2019s nose pitching up further, and the pilot\u2019s pitch control authority decreasing. These conditions resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle-of-attack, experiencing an aerodynamic stall, and colliding with water. Although pilots operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 are not required to conduct preflight weight and balance calculations, 14 CFR 91.9 does require the pilot-in-command to comply with the operating limits, including weight and balance, in the approved airplane flight manual, which provides pilots weight and balance computations, charts, and graphs.\u000bAlthough toxicology testing of the pilot revealed ethanol in both the liver and muscle specimens, the variation in the amount of ethanol in the tissue specimens suggests that most, and perhaps all, of the ethanol came from sources other than ingestion. Therefore, it is very unlikely that the pilot was impaired by ethanol at the time of the accident. Further, no evidence for medical impairment or incapacitation was found.\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to secure the cargo in the cargo compartment, which resulted in a weight shift that led to the center of gravity exceeding its aft limit during a go-around attempt and a subsequent  aerodynamic stall. Also causal to the accident were the pilot\u2019s inadequate preflight inspection and his loading the airplane beyond the cargo compartment weight limit."

The pilot made an uneventful landing at a nearby airport.  Examination of the engine revealed segments of the stage 2 aft cooling plate (S2ACP) exited the power turbine case.  Further investigation determined that the gas generator rotor's forward curvic seal was not installed during the operator's replacement of the gas generator turbine (GGT) module 92 hours prior to the event.  Manufacturer's analysis of the missing curvic seal revealed it would have caused the reversal of the secondary airflow in the B-sump, which eventually led to auto ignition of the B-sump oil and exposure of the B-sump hardware to elevated temperatures.  The elevated temperatures resulted in the separation of several B-sump components, including the separation of the compressor shaft.  The compressor shaft separation resulted in the GGT rotor to rub into the stator and extensive secondary damage, including the separation of the S2ACP.  The GGT module was replaced 209 hours prior to the event.  According to the manufacturer, the forward curvic seal is part of the engine assembly rather than part of either the GGT rotor assembly or the high pressure compressor rotor assembly.  According to General Electric (GE), if the curvic seal was removed from the engine during removal of the previous GGT rotor-stator assembly, and either discarded, or returned to GE's service facility with the rotor, a new seal would not have been included with the new GGT rotor-stator assembly, and the GGT could have been reinstalled without it.  The manufacturer also reported that the maintenance manuals did not call for the verification of curvic seal installation during GGT replacement.  This military engine was not a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificated engine, but did share similar design features of other FAA certificated engines.  The manufacturer reported that the civilian certificated engine maintenance manuals do call for the verification of curvic seal installation following a GGT replacement.  The engine was removed from the event helicopter 92 hours prior to the event and was shipped to an engine service center for an internal leak at the number 3 labyrinth seal (located in the front frame of the engine).  The service center repaired the inlet guide vanes, which, according to the manufacturer, was a typical repair when oil is observed leaking in the flow path in front of the compressor.  However, their analysis of the missing curvic seal indicates that it too would have resulted in an oil leak in the front frame.",

Witnesses reported that the airplane entered a right roll almost immediately after liftoff.  The roll continued to about 90 degrees right wing down at which point the right wingtip impacted the ground.  During examination of the wreckage, the aileron control system was found connected such that the airplane rolled in the opposite direction to that commanded in the cockpit.  The maintenance performed on the airplane before the accident flight included removal of the main landing gear (MLG) in order to stiffen the MLG struts.  Interviews with the mechanics who performed the maintenance revealed that during re-installation and system testing of the MLG, it was discovered that the changes to the MLG struts impacted the V-bracket holding the aileron control system's upper torque tube.  The V-bracket was removed and a redesigned V-bracket was installed in its place.  This work required the disconnection of a portion of the aileron control system, including the removal of the aft upper torque tube bell crank from the torque tube.  The mechanic who reinstalled the aft upper torque tube bell crank was under the incorrect assumption that there was only one way to install the bell crank on the torque tube.  However, there are actually two positions in which the bell crank could be installed. The incorrect installation is accomplished by rotating the bell crank 180\u00b0 about the axis of the torque tube and flipping it front to back, and this is the way the bell crank was found installed.  With the bell crank installed incorrectly and the rest of the system installed as designed, there is binding in the system.  This binding was noticed on the accident airplane during the inspection after initial installation.  However, the mechanic did not recognize that the bell crank was improperly installed on the torque tube.  Instead of fixing the problem by removing and correctly reinstalling the bell crank, he fixed the problem by disconnecting the necessary tie rods and rotating the upper torque tube so that the arm of the bell crank pointed up and to the left.  This action reversed the movement of the ailerons.  According to all of the personnel interviewed, there was no maintenance documentation to instruct mechanics how to perform the work since this was a proof-of-concept airplane.  None of the mechanics who performed the work could recall if the position of the ailerons in relation to the position of the control stick was checked.  Such a position check, if it had been performed by either the mechanics after the maintenance or by the flight crew during the preflight checks, would assuredly have indicated that the system was installed incorrectly.",

Contributing factors were the lack of maintenance documentation detailing the installation of the bell crank, the installing mechanic's incorrect assumption that the bell crank could only be installed in one position, and the failure of maintenance personnel and the flight crew to check the position of the control stick relative to the ailerons after the maintenance and during the preflight checks."

After that, she initiated her departure from the 3,000-foot dirt/turf runway. According to the pilot, the airplane's main landing gear bungee cords had recently been replaced and were significantly stiffer than the old ones, which caused the airplane to bounce more than she was used to on the dirt strip.

While filing his instrument flight plan, the weather briefer advised the pilot of moderate icing along the route of flight at an altitude range that included the pilot's planned cruising altitude. Although the single-engine airplane was not certified or equipped for flight into known icing conditions, the pilot proceeded with the flight. While en route, about 200 miles from the destination airport, the airplane's engine began to run rough, and the pilot enriched the fuel mixture, which alleviated the problem and also resulted in an increased fuel burn from about 14 gallons-per-hour to about 18 gallons-per-hour. At that time, the airplane was over a large metropolitan area with an airport where the pilot could have made a fuel stop; however, the pilot did not stop. As the flight continued, he had to descend to lower and lower altitudes due to icing conditions. About 4 hours into the flight, the pilot realized that he did not have enough fuel to reach his planned destination and attempted to divert to an airport that was 65 miles closer than the original destination airport. As an air traffic controller was providing vectors to the instrument landing system approach at the diversion airport, the pilot reported twice that he was concerned about fuel but did not declare an emergency. Even if the pilot had declared a fuel emergency, the controller\u2019s actions would likely have been no different as he was limited in what he could do by the prevailing instrument meteorological conditions. About 5 minutes after the first report of low fuel, the pilot reported that he had a fuel problem for a third time and that the engine had lost all power. The controller then provided directions to an open field, but the airplane impacted a wooded area about 15 miles from the diversion airport.

A pilot of one of the aerobatic airplanes reported that, shortly after the accident airplane crossed the border of an unpopulated wetland area, the airplane's pitch smoothly increased upward to an angle of about 30 degrees. The accident airplane was flying at a global positioning system-derived altitude of 29 feet. The airplane then began a roll to the left, and, as the airplane rolled toward an inverted attitude, the pitch quickly began decreasing below the horizon. The airplane then began a rapid descent and impacted the marsh below in a 68-degree nose-down pitch attitude. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that would preclude normal operation. Flight data recorded by a device onboard the accident airplane, along with statements provided by witnesses, suggested that one of the pilots likely attempted to perform an aileron roll at low altitude and that the maneuver had been performed on at least two previous occasions, at higher altitudes.The investigation could not determine which of the pilots was physically manipulating the controls at the time of the accident; however, given the right seat pilot\u2019s substantial previous flight experience, the provisions of the exclusive agreement under which he rented the accident airplane, and statements from witnesses affirming that the pilot had attempted the maneuver in the past, it is most likely that the right seat pilot was acting as pilot-in-command at the time of the accident and was either manipulating the controls or directing the left seat pilot\u2019s manipulation of the controls at the time. The right seat pilot had not logged any previous aerobatic experience, and witnesses described any undocumented experience he may have had as \u201clow.\u201d The manufacturer maneuver limits for the accident airplane model prohibit aerobatic maneuvers.The airplane\u2019s ballistic recovery parachute system likely activated during the impact sequence and was not activated by either of the occupants before impact given that the system\u2019s safety pin was found installed; it is unlikely that activation of the system would have affected the outcome of the event. Additionally, based on observations of the airplane\u2019s occupant restraint systems, recovered positions of the pilots\u2019 remains, and preaccident photographs recovered from an electronic device onboard the airplane, it is unlikely that the right seat pilot was wearing his shoulder restraint.

The pilot had successfully completed a flight review 10 days before the accident flight.  During the review the pilot flew his airplane about 2 minutes under simulated instrument flight conditions.  No other evidence of instrument flying was found during the preceding 6 months.  The accident occurred while the pilot was returning home following a vacation.  As the pilot approached the airport, a fog bank moved in and the local weather conditions deteriorated.  The VOR/GPS circling instrument approach procedure for the airport lists a minimum descent altitude of 680 feet mean sea level (msl), with a 1-mile minimum visibility requirement.  The overcast ceiling was 400 feet above ground level (597 feet msl), and the visibility was 1 mile as the flight entered the terminal area.  Near the time that the pilot received his instrument approach clearance, the visibility decreased to 1/2-mile and the ceiling lowered to 200 feet above ground level (agl) (397 feet msl); however, that information was not disseminated to the pilot by either the tower or approach controller, contrary to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) internal directives.  The pilot's approach was monitored by both the radar approach controller, and by the local tower controller on the tower's digital bright radar indicator (DBrite).  Radar data showed that the airplane was consistently left of course and the local tower controller advised the pilot of that fact and asked him if he was correcting back.  About 0.4 miles from the runway's end, the pilot advised the controller that he was going around.  The pilot failed to adhere to the published missed approach procedure.  During the next 1 to 2 minutes, the radar data showed the airplane making 360 degree turns about 0.5 miles from the runway until descending with what ground witnesses described as increasingly steep angles of bank into a house.

The private pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The aircraft was registered to a private individual and was operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which not operated on a flight plan. The flight originated from the Tuscola Airport (K96), Tuscola, Illinois, at 1720. The pilot reported that he switched from the right fuel tank, which had about 7 gallons of fuel, to the left fuel tank, which had about 12 gallons of fuel, when he was about 15 miles from the destination airport. While approaching the airport, he turned on the fuel boost pump, reduced the throttle to 20 inches of manifold pressure, applied carburetor heat, and began the descent to traffic pattern altitude. While on downwind, he reduced the engine power to idle and applied flaps. While on the base leg, he advanced the throttle; however, the engine stayed at idle power. He turned off the carburetor heat, adjusted the throttle, and cycled the boost pump, but was unable to gain engine power. Unable to make it to the runway, the pilot chose a plowed field in which to land. The airplane subsequently contacted a ditch at the end of the field, crossed over a road, and came to rest in another field.  ",

The night cross-country flight was conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) by a non-instrument rated private pilot.  Air traffic control radar track data and associated surface weather observations indicated that the flight encountered deteriorating cloud ceilings along the route.  The pilot obtained a pre-flight weather briefing, during which the briefer informed him of forecast and reported instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions along the proposed route of flight.  Track data indicated that the flight proceeded approximately 65 nautical miles (nm) north of the course proposed in the pre-flight briefing.  During the flight, the pilot contacted Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center and requested flight following.  The controller informed the pilot that radar contact could not be maintained in the area and at the altitude the airplane was operating.  The controller suggested that the pilot climb to a higher altitude in order to permit radar service.  The pilot replied, \"I've got clouds above me\" and stated that he would continue under VFR.  The radar altitude returns decreased from 3,400 feet mean sea level (msl) to 2,100 feet msl during the final 65 nautical miles (nm) of the flight.  The reported cloud ceiling 65 nm south of the accident site and along the flight path was 3,600 above ground level (agl) (5,000 feet msl).

The pilot said the takeoff roll was \"a little longer\" than usual, which he attributed to the high temperature. He noticed a lower propeller rpm (1 to 2 inches) and manifold pressure, and the airplane was in a 50 to 100 foot per minute rate of descent. He realized he needed to jettison the retardant, and made several unsuccessful attempts to use the emergency jettison handle. While his attention was diverted to jettisoning the load, the airplane collided with terrain. The pilot failed to disengage the emergency release (jettison) handle-locking lever prior to takeoff as required by the Pilot Operating Handbook. He also chose not to arm the hydraulic power for the retardant gate prior to takeoff. When examined at the accident site, the slurry mixture was of a \"very thick consistency.\" The pilot said he mixed and loaded the slurry, called Fire-Trol, into the airplane. The slurry consisted of ammonium phosphate, a clay thickener, corrosion inhibitor, and colorant. A sample of the slurry, removed from the sealed pump hose, was tested and found to be LCA-R (concentrated retardant unmixed with water).

Both private-rated pilots were fatally injured during the ditching when the airplane flipped over,and remained inverted and submerged in about 4 feet of water. Examination of the airframe and flight controls did not reveal any anomalies. Examination of the engine revealed that the interior of the #4 cylinder assembly had incurred mechanical damage, and both the top of the piston and the cylinder head exhibited multiple indentations. In addition, a hole was found to be present in the top of the piston. The No. 4 exhaust valve tulip was found to have separated from the stem, and the oil pressure screen was found to contain a small amount of aluminum particles. During disassembly, fragments of the exhaust valve tulip were found within the combustion chamber and in the exhaust system, and the fragments varied in size and shape, with about  50 percent of the tulip being missing. In addition, the examination revealed that various steel components within the power section exhibited corrosion. Corrosion was found on the crankshaft, camshaft, and accessory gears. The bearing surfaces within the power section exhibited evidence of dirt/particle embedment.   The NTSB retained the parts pertaining to the #4 cylinder assembly, to include fragments of the No. 4 exhaust valve, 8 tappets, and plungers, and the center main bearing, for further examination, but extensive damage to the valve stem and head surfaces precluded any determination of a fracture mechanism. Research into airplane's maintenance history revealed that the last engine overhaul had been performed 23 years prior to the accident. At the time of the accident, the engine had accumulated 1246.49 hours in service. Lycoming Service Instruction No. 1009AQ indicates that the O-320 Series engine should be overhauled after 2000 hours time in service. Engines that do not accumulate the hourly time between overhauls, are recommended to be overhauled in the twelfth year. In addition, in 1983 Lycoming changed the part number for the exhaust valve for the accident engine, and  Lycoming's Service Bulletin 240 suggests that the old exhaust valves, made from martensitic stainless steel, should be replaced with the new part, made from a nickel-base superalloy, at the time of overhaul, which records indicate had not been performed.  \"Lycoming Mandatory Service Bulletin No. 388B\" addresses the subject: Procedure to Determine Valve and Guide Condition, and a review of maintenance records for subject engine showed that on July 2, 1999, the engine had been given a \"Lycoming 400-hour valve inspection.\"",
            "probable_cause": "The owner/operator's failure to perform an overhaul or comply with a service bulletin 240 which would have probably precluded the continued installation of the number four cylinder exhaust valve and its subsequent failure."

The power deterioration of this scenario was consistent with documented examples of carburetor icing.
