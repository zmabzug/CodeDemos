The airplane flew through one controller\u2019s airspace and entered another controller\u2019s airspace without coordination before radar and radio contact was established. While the incident airplane\u2019s transponder was not activated, the airplane\u2019s radar data tag (which contained identification, altitude, and airspeed information) did not automatically appear on the controllers\u2019 radar displays as it normally would have.  Consequently, the airplane was displayed only as an enhanced primary target with no identifying information.  Although local procedures require that Atlanta tower controllers verify that departures have a radar data tag before transferring communications to departure controllers, the tower controllers did not do so.  Review of primary radar data determined that a loss of lateral separation occurred between the incident airplane and the following three airplanes:  1) a Beechcraft 55 (closest proximity 1.44 miles); 2) a Pilatus PC-12 (closest proximity 0.81 miles), and 3) a Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-100 (closest proximity 2.36 miles).",

About 2 hours into the flight, witnesses observed the helicopter flying along a valley and colliding with one of two \u201cskylines,\u201d or cables strung between the towers of power transmission lines. The transmission lines consisted of two parallel steel skylines on top and three power conductor lines mounted about 20 feet below. The helicopter appeared to be flying straight and level prior to the collision, exhibiting no indications of distress. Examination of the engine and damage to the rotor system indicated that the engine was producing power at the time of the collision. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any evidence of preaccident failure or malfunction. The transmission lines were depicted on the applicable sectional map, as well as a printed survey map located in the debris field. The power conductor lines were observed to sag about 70 feet below the skyline in the area of the accident. The power conductor lines were about twice as thick as the skyline. Additionally, the position of the sun would have hindered identification of the skyline by the pilot. In the area of the collision a second set of power lines were located about 200 feet below the lines depicted on the maps. As such, it is possible that the pilot misidentified these as the lines depicted on the maps. Neither of the sets of power lines were equipped with spherical visibility markers or similar identification devices. The helicopter was equipped with a wire strike protection system; however, examination of its cutting surfaces revealed that it did not make contact with any lines. The helicopter struck the second skyline along the direction of flight, indicating that it flew below the first line with the main rotor blades striking the second line from below; since the wire struck outside of the cutters\u2019 capture envelope, the wire strike protection system would not have been in a position to protect the helicopter. Federal regulations require that any planned construction of structures over 200 feet above ground level (agl) be filed with the Federal Aviation Administration.

Earlier in the day, the airplane had departed from a private airstrip with approximately 15 gallons of fuel on board.  A person, who was in the vicinity of the accident site, witnessed an airplane flying toward the airport about 100 feet agl, and that the \"engine was not running.\"  He watched the airplane fly over a tree line and disappear, but he did not hear any kind of impact noise.  No radio transmissions were heard from the accident airplane.  There was a report by a friend of the pilot that the radio in the airplane was inoperative.  Examination of the airframe and engine at the accident site did not reveal any mechanical pre-impact anomalies.  The fuel tanks in both wings were not breached.  The airplane was leveled, and approximately 1.5 gallons of clear automotive gasoline was drained from the airplane's fuel tanks.  There did not appear to be an odor of fuel present when the investigation team first examined the wreckage.  The wing-mounted, vented fuel caps were found secured.  When the fuel level transmitter from each fuel tank was removed, the float arms for each moved smoothly, and were not restricted.  Power was applied to the aircraft and each transmitter float moved through their full range of motion, and valid indications were observed on both fuel level gauges.  The fuel selector handle was found in the \"Both\" position.  The fuel screen was removed and found to be clean and clear of debris.  According to manufacturer's documentation, the total fuel capacity of the airplane was 39 gallons (both tanks), of which, 3.0 gallons are not usable (1.5 gallons per tank).  The total fuel found on-board at the accident site was approximately 1.5 gallons.  Total flight time, from when the pilot last refueled the airplane with 15 gallons, could not be determined.  Examination of the wrecakge showed that the basic shape and volume of the cabin was not altered during the crash.  The pilot's seat was found intact with the exception of the forward inboard roller assembly, which remained attached to the seat rail within the cabin.  The pilot's lap belt was found intact.  Shoulder harnesses were not installed, and by FAA regulations, they were not required to be installed in the 1965 year model airplane.

The conditions were below VFR minimums, which were required to conduct the passenger-carrying commercial flight in a single-engine airplane.  The conditions later improved and the pilot departed under a special VFR clearance.  The pilot performed two approaches at the destination airport in IMC that were consistent with the two GPS approaches that were available there. Weather data and witnesses indicate that daylight conditions, low clouds and poor visibility prevailed, with cloud tops at 1,000 feet. After the second approach, the pilot radioed that he was heading back to the departure airport because he could not see the airport.  No distress calls or unusual engine noises were heard.  The airplane subsequently flew north of the airport and away from the departure airport at an altitude beneath the minimum radar coverage of 2,200 feet.  It impacted the frozen Arctic Ocean in a right bank and at a 60-degree nose-down attitude about three miles away from the location of the pilot's last radio transmission.  An examination of the airplane (before it sank through cracking ice) revealed no pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  An examination of the propeller revealed that it was under a power setting consistent with a maneuvering airspeed at the time of impact.  An examination of the autopilot annunciator filament revealed that the autopilot was not engaged at impact.  The airplane was nearly full of fuel and over its published maximum gross weight at impact.  Small pieces of clear ice, about 1/4-inch thick, were found on portions of the tail surfaces.

While taxiing, he lost directional control of the airplane and after observing a ditch, he applied power to clear the ditch.  The airplane cleared the ditch and he then reduced power and the airplane descended and came to rest in brush.  As a result of the landing in brush, damage to the airplane consisted of the shearing of the right main landing gear.  Additionally, skin inboard of the right main landing gear was damaged.  The airplane was dropped during recovery causing additional damage.  The pilot did not initially advise the NTSB there was a passenger on board the airplane.  The pilot later reported in writing that at no time did the airplane attain liftoff speed, and that a wind gust caused a ground loop.  The pilot-rated passenger who is a FAA certificated airframe and powerplant mechanic verbally reported that he was onboard the airplane to check whether the installed transponder was operational.  He boarded the airplane, donned a headset to communicate with the pilot, and by habit buckled his seatbelt though there was no intent for flight.  He was not paying attention to what was occurring, and reported he did not know how fast the pilot was taxiing or whether engine power was increased at any point while he was on the airplane.  He was looking at a sectional for a planned future flight, and reported the pilot advised him with words to the effect that the airplane was going to crash.  He looked up, saw trees, braced for impact, and the airplane mushed into trees.  He exited the airplane using the left door, as the right door was blocked by obstructions and the way the airplane was resting.  He further stated the airplane was traveling westbound from the pilot's hangar towards the runway, and the wind was from the west or southwest at 11-13 miles per hour (mph).  He also stated that the airplane was equipped with a short takeoff and landing (STOL) kit and could become airborne at 40-45 mph.  A pilot-rated witness reported that he heard engine power applied and observed the airplane flying westbound, climbing steeply to an estimated 100 feet above ground level.  The airplane then banked abruptly to the left about 45 degrees angle of bank, and he then heard engine power reduced.  The airplane then settled to the ground where he heard two impacts.  He did not hear any discrepancy related to the engine, and reported it sounded strong and steady, with no sputtering.  He reported that the pilot's house is located approximately 400-450 feet east of the north/south oriented runway.  The pilot provided a statement from an individual who reported hearing an engine start, followed by running at idle speed.  He then heard the engine rpm increase to what he thought would be for taxiing.  He then heard the engine sound increase to a very high sound for 4-5 seconds followed by decreasing to a low rpm sound.  He then heard a, \"thump, thump, thump\" sound and drove to the runway where he observed the pilot and passenger walking from the airplane that was located in weeds west of the runway approximately 25 feet.

The airplane was being positioned to another airport, and had a deadheading flight crew on board.  Prior to the descent, the captain noted an airspeed anomaly for the existing power setting.  He also observed that the flap indicator showed a \"slight\" deployment of the flaps.  He requested that the deadheading captain look out a cabin window, and verify the flap position.  The deadheading captain reported to the flying captain that the flaps were in the fully retracted position.  About this time, ATC personnel requested that a descent be initiated, which the flight crew initiated by reducing the power to slow down the airplane.  As the deadheading captain was making his way back to his cabin seat, the airplane encountered severe turbulence, which lasted about 5 to 10 seconds.  He was thrown about the cabin and injured.

Please see the docket for this accident to view the original report.***  A company that designed and manufactured airborne radar units, primarily for military applications, was using the accident airplane (as well as one other airplane) for some of the airborne development and testing of the externally mounted radar equipment. The pilot was in the left seat and a test engineer, who was not a pilot, was in the right seat. The airplane was equipped with a supplemental electrical power supply system that the company had designed and manufactured to provide electrical power for the radar systems and support equipment on the test flights. Most of the supplemental power supply system was located in the combined baggage area and the area vacated by the removal of the rear seats. In its installed position, the supplemental power supply system was not intended or able to be reached by the pilot or engineer during flight.About 2 hours into the radar test flight, the test engineer smelled smoke in the airplane. The pilot attempted to locate the source of the smoke and observed an open flame on the supplemental power supply. Because the fire was out of the pilot's or engineer's reach and the airplane was not equipped with a fire extinguisher, the pilot decided to land as soon as possible. During the attempted emergency landing on a road, the airplane struck power lines suspended above the road and then impacted the ground. Detailed examination of airplane and power system components revealed that the fire involved several wires that connected directly to the power system battery and that the fire had spread to the airplane floor carpet.The supplemental electrical power supply system components included, in part, an automobile-type 12-volt direct current battery, which was encased in a covered, plastic box, and a company-designed and -manufactured hard-plastic power distribution box. The power distribution box was stacked on top of the battery box, and they were secured in place by a ratcheting cargo strap system. In that configuration, two 12- to 14-gauge plastic-insulated wires, one red and one black, were situated and pressed between the top cover of the battery box and the bottom of the power distribution box, and then routed into the distribution box via a single grommeted hole in the bottom of that box. The installation had no provisions for separating or protecting the two wires, and the evidence was consistent with the wires abutting or crossing one another while pressed between the two boxes.The high-vibration environment of the test airplane caused relative motion between the two boxes and/or the boxes and the wires. That relative motion, combined with the pressure exerted by the boxes on the wires, abraded the insulation of those wires, which then allowed their conductors to contact one another. Because the black wire was connected directly to the negative battery terminal and the red wire was electrically connected to the positive battery terminal, contact of those conductors yielded a direct electrical short. The wires were rated to carry a maximum current of about 45 amperes, and the battery-rated output was 750 amperes. The short circuit resulted in a significant overcurrent in the wires, which caused excessive heating, additional insulation failure, smoke, and fire. Although the pilot did not recall all of the details of the event, the evidence indicated that the fire produced a significant amount of soot and heavy particulate matter, and possibly other physiological irritants. The wire installation was not in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) maintenance guidance, which advised that wire insulation be protected against chafing or abrasion because damage can result in a short circuit. The appearance of the supplemental electrical power supply, particularly its intercomponent wiring, was consistent with that of test-bench equipment, designed to be operated in a stationary environment with minimal or no vibration. No guidance or other documentation regarding the physical installation of the system components in the airplane or the security and protection of the associated wiring was located. A company technician, who was not an FAA-certified aircraft mechanic, reported that he accomplished the original installation of the supplemental power supply a few weeks before the accident; the power supply had accumulated about 13 hours of operation since its installation. The investigation was unable to determine if, how many times, or by whom, the power supply or its components might have been adjusted, moved, removed, and/or reinstalled. It could also not be determined whether the company-contracted aircraft mechanic had provided any installation guidance or whether he had examined, changed, or otherwise contacted or disturbed the original installation, because that mechanic did not respond to requests for information. The installation and arrangement of the affected wires were not in compliance with acceptable practices for aircraft, and the installation presented a serious hazard to flight safety due to the high potential for insulation abrasion and failure, with the resultant unintended electrical path(s).",
            "probable_cause": "***This report was modified on August 18, 2015. Please see the docket for this accident to view the original report.*** The operator's improper installation of a supplemental electrical power supply, which caused a short circuit due to inadequate vibration and abrasion protection, which resulted in chafing of the wires, which contacted one another, short-circuited, and caused an onboard fire. Contributing to the accident were the installation of the supplemental electrical power supply system without the supervision of an FAA-certified mechanic, the lack of an onboard means for fire suppression, and the pilot's inability to see the low-conspicuity power lines across the landing approach path until it was too late to take evasive action."

About 800 feet from the start of the takeoff roll the airplane became airborne about 8 feet off the ground, then went nose and left wing low into the runway where the left propeller struck the grass surface.  Twenty propeller slash marks were found in the grass surface at the point in the runway were the witnesses saw the propeller strike the ground.

N89827 originated at the Dolphin Aviation ramp, which is located on the south side of SRQ.  At 1025:24, the SRQ GC instructed N89827 to 'taxi to runway [14].'  Taxiway A, which is adjacent to the Dolphin Aviation ramp, runs parallel to runway 14 and joins it at the end.  N89827 proceeded to runway 14 via taxiway A.  As the GC issued the taxi instructions to N89827, he was relieved by the supervisor/ground controller (SGC).  The GC provided a relief briefing to the SGC and left the tower cab.  At 1028:03, the pilot of N79960 transmitted to ground control that he was  'at [J]ones and ready to taxi.' The Jones Aviation ramp is on the north side of SRQ; aircraft originating at the Jones Aviation ramp intending to use runway 14 are normally assigned intersection departures from taxiway F.  The Aeronautical Information Manual, Pilot/Controller Glossary, defines an intersection departure as 'a departure from any runway intersection except the end of the runway.'  (The pilot in the right front seat of N79960 held a pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA].  The pilot in the left front seat held a pilot certificate issued by the Canadian Civil Aviation Authority.  Although the investigation could not determine which pilot in N79960 was operating the controls, only the right seat pilot was certified by the FAA; therefore, he was the only pilot on board authorized to act as pilot-in-command.  Accordingly, this brief will refer to the right seat pilot as 'the pilot' and the left seat pilot as 'the pilot-rated passenger.')  At 1028:45, the SGC cleared N79960 to 'taxi to runway [14].'  N79960 held at the intersection of runway 14 and taxiway F.  Although the pilot's reported position at the Jones Aviation ramp would suggest an intersection departure at taxiway F, the SGC annotated the flight progress strip for N79960 to indicate that it would be positioned for takeoff from the approach end of runway 14.  The SGC told investigators after the accident that he did not recall N79960 originating at the Jones Aviation ramp and that his issuance of the taxi instructions to runway 14, with no mention of the taxiway F intersection, indicated that he must have thought that the airplane was originating at the Dolphin Aviation ramp.  At 1030:42, the pilot of N89827 made his first contact with the local controller (LC), stating that he was 'ready for takeoff.'  (About the time of this transmission, another airplane, a Cessna 172, N52553, was positioned behind N89827 on taxiway A waiting for departure.)  At 1032:46, the pilot of N79960 made his first contact with the LC, stating, 'we're number two ready for takeoff.'  (About the time of this transmission, N79960 was positioned behind another airplane, N5287V, which was on taxiway F waiting for an intersection departure.)  At 1033:57, the LC instructed N89827 to 'taxi into position and hold' and stated, 'traffic will depart downfield also.'  At 1034:22, the LC cleared N5287V for takeoff from the taxiway F intersection.  After N5287V's departure, at 1034:43, the LC cleared N89827 for takeoff from the approach end of runway 14.  At 1034:47, the pilot of N89827 acknowledged the takeoff clearance.  At 1034:51, the LC instructed N79960 to 'taxi into position and hold' on runway 14, which the pilot acknowledged.  About 6 1/2 seconds elapsed between the two pilots' transmissions.  According to a postaccident interview with the LC, on the basis of the information in the flight progress strip, he believed that N79960 was positioned for takeoff at the approach end of runway 14.  When N89827 began its takeoff roll from the approach end of runway 14, the LC erroneously believed that it was safe to instruct N79960 to taxi onto the runway for departure.  Witnesses stated that when N89827 obtained takeoff speed near the 6,000-foot remaining marker (about 200 feet from the collision point), N79960 entered the runway from a taxiway (F) on the left side of the runway.  Witnesses further stated that N89827 lifted off and turned to the right in what appeared to be an attempt to avoid a collision with N79960.  Witnesses indicated that N89827 appeared to stall and that the left wing dropped to a wings-level attitude.  About 15 seconds after N79960's acknowledgement of the taxi-into-position-and-hold clearance, a loud burst of static and an emergency locator transmitter signal can be heard on the air traffic control voice tape.  N89827 impacted the top of N79960 on runway 14 at the taxiway F intersection. N89827's propeller contacted N79960's aft cabin roof, inboard wing flaps, and fuel tanks. Upon impact, a fire immediately erupted in N79960's fuel tanks. N79960 flipped inverted over the left wing and nose of N89827, and N89827's propeller separated from the engine. The two airplanes came to rest about 75 feet down the runway from the initial impact point on about a 300-degree heading. N89827 was found inverted on the runway, and N79960 was found inverted on top of N89827. ",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the supervisor/ground controller and the local controller to provide effective separation between the accident airplanes on the runway, resulting in a collision during takeoff. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the pilot and pilot-rated passenger on board N79960 to ensure that the runway was clear of traffic before taxiing onto the runway. Also contributing to the accident was the failure of air traffic control guidance and procedures to incorporate redundant methods of verifying aircraft position for both controllers and pilots. "

While en route, he checked the weather at an airport located about 23 nautical miles from the airstrip and learned that the wind was from 310 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 16 knots. Upon reaching the airstrip, the pilot looked for a windsock or other wind indicator, but did not find one. He discounted the wind information he had obtained for the distant airport, as it was located over a mountain range from the airstrip, and decided to land to the south on runway 18 based on the ranch owner's advice.

He approached the airport from the northeast overflew the airport, and made a left turn to enter the downwind leg for runway 23. He saw some parachutes on the ground and some in the air. He saw a tandem jumper toward the southwest and believed he had accounted for all jumpers.  As he turned left, he saw a flash of colors, felt an impact and drag from the left wing. He got the airplane on the ground as soon as possible. Radar data indicated that the airplane was about 1,300 feet msl when it was approaching runway 5/23 from the northeast. The airplane flew over runway 23, near mid field, about 1,100 feet msl and was between 900 to 800 feet msl during the left bank entering the downwind for runway 23; last capture was at 300 feet as it approached runway 23. One jumper stated the parachute landing zone was located on the airport adjacent to the left side of runway 30. The video equipment that was carried by the cinematographer captured the collision. The cinematographer jumps with the last tandem jumpers. The tandem chute deploys at 3 minutes and 7 seconds into the video, 13 seconds later the cinematographer's chute deploys. During his descent, he removes the helmet-mounted camera and looks into the view making a few remarks about the jump. He places the camera back to its original position and continues to capture; the sky is overcast and visibility is good. The view pans to the right and captures three skydivers with chutes deployed at an altitude above him. At approximately 4 minutes and 54 seconds into the video, a sound similar to an airplane engine can be heard at an increasing level for 5 seconds. At 4 minutes and 59 seconds, the view pans slightly left and a sound similar to an impact is heard. The view becomes blurry and pans rapidly. At 5 minutes and 2 seconds, three frames capture what appears to be an aircraft in close proximity banking away and to the right of the camera's view. The view continues to pan rapidly for about 6 seconds showing shots of the ground, sky, and parachute. The camera stabilizes and records until impact with the ground at 5 minutes and 46 seconds. One of the master tandem jumpers on that jump stated that the pilot did not give a briefing on which runway or approach he was going to use. The norm is for the jumpers to avoid crossing runways below 1,000 feet and to stay away about 300 feet from the runways, and the pilot to avoid jumpers at all time. Due to the amount of jumps that are performed per day there is no briefing before each flight. Approaches and runway selection depends on the individual pilot. A representative of the operator stated that only verbal guidance is given to the pilots to follow the FAA rules and it up to their discretion for approaches and runway selection. The acting airport manager stated that there is no agreement for airport operations between the skydive operator and the city, only the lease agreement.

The flight instructor had given the pilot/owner his initial instruction in the airplane and flew with the pilot/owner regularly. The flight instructor had also given the pilot/owner about 58 hours of dual instruction in the accident airplane. The pilot/owner had accumulated about 51 hours of pilot-in-command time in the airplane make and model. It is likely that the pilot/owner was the pilot flying.Several witnesses reported observing the accident sequence. One witness reported seeing the airplane pull up into vertical flight, bank left, rotate nose down, and then impact the ground. One witness reported observing the airplane go from east to west, turn sharply, and then go north of the runway. He subsequently saw the airplane hit the ground. One witness, who was a pilot, stated that he observed the airplane enter a left bank and then a nose-down attitude of about 75 degrees at an altitude of about 300 feet above ground level, which was too low to recover. It is likely that the pilot was attempting a go-around and pitched up the airplane excessively and subsequently lost control, which resulted in the airplane impacting flat desert terrain about 100 feet north of the active runway at about the midfield point in a steep nose-down, left-wing-low attitude. The airplane was destroyed by postimpact forces and thermal damage. All components necessary for flight were accounted for at the accident site. A postaccident examination of the airframe and both engines revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Additionally, an examination of both propellers revealed rotational scoring and twisting of the blades consistent with there being power during the impact sequence. No anomalies were noted with either propeller that would have precluded normal operation. Toxicological testing of the pilot was negative for drugs and alcohol. The flight instructor\u2019s toxicology report revealed the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Given the elevated levels of metabolite in the urine and kidney, the absence of quantifiable THC in the urine, and the low level of THC in the kidney and liver, it is likely that the flight instructor most recently used marijuana at least several hours before the accident. However, the effects of marijuana use on the flight instructor\u2019s judgment and performance at the time of the accident could not be determined.A review of the flight instructor\u2019s personal medical records indicated that he had a number of medical conditions that would have been grounds for denying his airman medical certificate. The ongoing treatment of his conditions with more than one sedating benzodiazepine, including oxazepam, simultaneously would also likely not have been allowed. However, none of the prescribed, actively sedating medications were found in the flight instructor\u2019s tissues, and oxazepam was only found in the urine, which suggests that the flight instructor used the medication many hours and possibly several days before the accident. The toxicology findings indicate that the flight instructor likely did not experience any impairment from the benzodiazepine medication itself; however, the cognitive effects from the underlying mood disturbance could not be determined.",

The test flight was conducted with the bucket and 150 foot long line attached to facilitate the test procedure.  Witnesses reported observing the rotorcraft between 300 and 1,000 feet in altitude and beginning a climb when it began to pitch/roll and descend rapidly.  Several witnesses reported seeing the bucket horizontal to the rotorcraft and also caught up in one of the rotors.  The aircraft impacted on its right side intact with the exception of its rotor blades.  Two of the three forward rotor blades were found 600-900 feet from the ground impact site.  The third forward rotor blade, which was broken in half, was found with its outboard section at the ground impact site and the inboard half approximately 100 feet away.  All three aft rotor blades were found in close proximity to one another and approximately 400 feet distant from the primary ground impact site. All six blades separated from their root sections in about the same place and a post crash fire destroyed much of the rotorcraft.  Post crash examination established control continuity from the cockpit area through the control closet and on to all the associated hydraulic actuators as well as the continuity of the entire synchronization drive shafting.  Examination and disassembly of all major components revealed no evidence of any  fatigue propagation, disconnects, or characteristics of other time dependent failure mechanisms.  All hydraulic actuators underwent an X-ray examination and disassembly and there was no evidence of any blockage or jamming within any of the actuators.  The engines were examined and disassembled and the gas generator speed range for both was determined to be  between 64.3% and 69.7%, or about 10% above ground idle.

As he did so, the helicopter began to yaw right and descend. The pilot corrected the yaw and increased collective pitch; however, the helicopter continued to descend. He then moved the cyclic forward in an attempt to fly through effective translational lift, but the descent continued, and the helicopter impacted the swamp and came to rest on its right side.

Radar data indicated that the airplane entered the left downwind leg of the traffic pattern, flew at pattern attitude, and then performed a right approximate 250-degree turn to enter the final leg of the approach. During the final leg of the approach, the airplane crashed short of the runway into a house located in a residential neighborhood near the airport. According to the airplane's pilot operating handbook, the minimum multi-engine approach speed was 95 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), and the minimum controllable airspeed was 82 KIAS. According to radar data, the airplane's groundspeed was about 69 knots with the probability of a direct crosswind.Postaccident examination of the propellers indicated that both propellers were turning at a low power setting at impact. During a controlled test run of the right engine, a partial power loss was noted. After examination of the throttle and control assembly, two o-rings within the assembly were found to be damaged. The o-rings were replaced with comparable o-rings and the assembly was reinstalled. During the subsequent test run, the engine operated smoothly with no noted anomalies. Examination of the o-rings revealed that the damage was consistent with the o-rings being pinched between the corner of the top o-ring groove and the fuel inlet surface during installation. It is probable that the right engine had a partial loss of engine power while on final approach to the runway due to the damaged o-ring and that the pilot retarded the engine power to prevent the airplane from rolling to the right. The investigation found no mechanical malfunction of the left engine that would have prevented the airplane from maintaining the published airspeed.",

The pilot's intent was not to fly. There was not enough runway remaining to land safely so the pilot decided to continue flying the airplane about 5 miles to an airport that had multiple long runways and to try to land. He flew the airplane in a large circle trying to get the feel for the controls so he would be better prepared to land.

The airplane was registered to and operated by AIRCCS, LLC; Humble, Texas, as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 business flight. Day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed and a flight plan had not been filed. The airplane departed George Bush Intercontinental/Houston Airport (IAH), Houston, Texas, at 1133 and was destined for Austin Bergstrom International Airport (AUS), Austin, Texas.The pilot reported that during initial climb, he noticed the engine temperatures began increasing and he reduced power in an attempt to lower the engine temperatures.  When the airplane was about 900 feet above ground level (agl) the engine began detonating, and soon after there was a complete loss of engine power. With no suitable forced landing areas the pilot deployed the CAPS ballistic parachute system and the airplane impacted terrain and came to rest upright next to a residence.An initial on-scene wreckage examination showed there was adequate fuel on-board.

Disassembly of the engine revealed that the gearcase was ruptured in the 1st bull gear's plane of rotation and that the 1st bull gear had a 90 degree arc of the rim and gear teeth separated.  Metallurgical examination of the 1st bull gear revealed a fatigue fracture that had originated in the gear's bore splines.  The fatigue originated in area where the spline thickness was significantly reduced by indentations on the pressure surface of the splines.  Review of the engine's overhaul manual revealed a tie-rod was used to provide a clamping force between the spur gear and 1st bull gear.  The assembly procedures required that the tie-rod be stretched with a load of 22,000 pounds, and then secured with a nut that was hand-tightened.  During disassembly of the gearcase, it was not possible to determine the amount of stretch on the tie-rod, or the breakaway torque on the retaining nut.  Maintenance records revealed that the gearcase was disassembled, and reassembled during repairs, which were performed by engine manufacturer. ",

While being vectored for the Runway 24 ILS approach, as the flaps were selected to 20 degrees and the landing gear was extended, the crew noted that the left and right amber HYDR PRESS lights began to illuminate.  When the lights began to flash with more regularity, the crew discussed whether to continue or divert to another airport.  The captain decided to proceed to the destination airport, with a 5,425-foot runway.  After touchdown, the captain applied normal braking, but the brakes did not respond. Additionally, the crew attempted to use the reverse thrusters, which also did not respond.  The captain then attempted to apply emergency braking, but the emergency brake lever would not move.  The captain then requested the FO to apply emergency braking.  The captain then declared he was aborting the landing, immediately after which, the FO successfully engaged the emergency brakes.  The airplane proceeded off the departure end of the wet runway, struck a localizer antenna, and came to rest in a fence.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the left main landing gear actuator extend hose leaked hydraulic fluid and was not torqued to specifications.  According to a work item sheet, a corrective action was entered on the sheet on June 14, 'Replaced main gear actuator extend pressure hoses.  Replaced uplock main gear hoses with new [Teflon] hoses.'  The Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) stated that in the event of a hydraulic pressure loss, 'With no flaps, no spoilers, no thrust reversers, and no anti-skid, the landing distance will be greatly increased.'  Multiply the Actual Landing Distance for Anti-Skid ON shown in Section V by a factor of 3.'  The calculated landing distance, uncorrected, was 3,690 feet.  The factor of three required an 11,000-foot runway.  No abnormal or emergency quick reference checklists were found in the cockpit, and there was no mention of abnormal or emergency procedures in the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript.  An AFM, which contained an abnormal checklist and procedures section, was found in a side pocket next to the captain.  Examination of company personnel files revealed that the captain had been issued an 'Employee Warning Notice,' in August 1998, for failure to follow instructions and rudeness to employees or customers.  The notice also stated that numerous FO's reported that the pilot was rude and discourteous when he addressed them, and that he was not promoting good cockpit resource management (CRM).  The captain had not received company CRM training.  The airplane was part of a fractional ownership program and was operated under 14 CFR Part 91. ",

Both airplanes were operating under visual flight rules, and both airplanes were transmitting the 1200 VFR beacon code on their respective transponders.  Neither airplane was required to be in radio contact with air traffic control.  The student pilot in the Cessna who survived the accident reported that the CFI let him take the flight controls while they were flying straight and level.  He reported that he was flying the airplane and was looking straight ahead, trying to maintain straight and level flight.  He reported that the CFI put her hand on the throttle and started explaining a climb procedure.  He reported that while the CFI was explaining the climb procedure, the airplane was hit by another airplane on the right side.  He reported that he never saw the other airplane before the impact and that he didn't think the CFI saw it either.  He reported that the CFI did not grab the controls or make any \"violent maneuvers\" prior to the impact.

The Piper climbed from about 1,900 feet pressure altitude to about 2,300 feet pressure altitude during the 2 minutes prior to impact.  The relative bearing between the Piper and the Cessna was about 60 degrees.

The airplane's altitude was approximately 200 to 400 feet when the airplane's wings wobbled back and forth. The airplane's wings banked approximately 90 degrees to the left, and then the airplane nosed over and impacted the ground.  White smoke was seen coming from the belly of the airplane for 1 to 2 seconds about 20 seconds prior to it impacting the ground. The terrain was a flat, hard packed field used for growing grass sod.

The airplane landed with the right wing main landing gear retracted causing substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage structures. The total loss of hydraulic power to the airplane flaps, spoilers, thrust reversers, and landing gear was caused by a ruptured hydraulic pressure hose assembly. The examinations of the accident and exemplar hoses revealed internal wear between the fiberglass within the hose's fire sleeve and the stainless steel braid. The accident hose and two of the three exemplar hoses did not show any markings or damage to the exterior of the sleeve to indicate the existence of the internal wear abrading the stainless steel braiding. Functional testing of the landing gear system revealed that the extension sequence varied during eight actuations, and, in one actuation, the left main landing gear remained retracted.

The copilot had contacted flight service before the initial flight and learned of thunderstorms in the area; the flight had to divert from its planned destination. The copilot contacted flight service before a second flight, and the flight service specialist advised that visual flight rules flight was not recommended due to low cloud ceilings and visibility. The pilot decided to land at an airport closer to his destination. At that airport, the copilot again contacted flight service and remarked that he was trying to figure out how to \"scud run\" to get home. He also spoke to his wife, who told him that the weather \"was bad\" at their final destination, and she reported that she thought they would delay their flight until the next day. Even though his calls to the weather briefer and his wife indicated adverse weather along the route of flight and at the destination, the copilot likely advised the pilot to continue the flight. About 20 minutes into the flight, the copilot contacted the Orlando approach controller and reported that they had inadvertently entered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The controller instructed him to set the transponder code to 0311 so that she could locate the airplane and then to contact Miami Center; however, no further communications were received from the copilot. Review of radar data revealed that, shortly after contacting Orlando Approach control, while the controller was attempting to locate the airplane, it descended in three left circuits from 8,900 feet mean sea level (msl) to 1,800 feet msl. It subsequently made a right circuit, descended to 900 feet msl, and continued to proceed toward the destination airport, eventually descending to 200 feet msl. The last 3 minutes of radar data showed the airplane flying at an altitude between 100 and 200 feet msl. The final radar target was recorded while the airplane was in a left circuit at 200 feet, about 1/8 mile southwest of the accident site. The wreckage was located the following day in a heavily wooded, deep water, swamp area, and no debris path was observed. Given the radar data and the existence of marginal visual conditions, moderate rain, and the pilot not being instrument rated, it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation.Two toxicological tests revealed measurements of diphenhydramine in the pilot's blood at levels within or well above the therapeutic range indicating that the pilot likely took the drug about 2 to 3 hours before the accident. Diphenhydramine causes marked sedation and is also classed as a depressant and used as a sleep aid. Altered mood and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance may also be observed. Therefore, it is very likely that cognitive and psychomotor impairment caused by diphenhydramine contributed to the pilot's poor judgment about flying in marginal weather conditions and may have further impaired his ability to appropriately cope with relatively unfamiliar flying conditions when he flew into IMC.",
            "probable_cause": "The noninstrument-rated pilot's improper decision to continue visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions and his subsequent spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident was the copilot's improper evaluation of the weather conditions after receiving several weather briefings for the flight. Also contributing to the accident was the pilot-in-command's cognitive and psychomotor impairment due to recent use of an overthecounter sedating antihistamine and the pilots' personal pressure to get home."

            "narrative": "On April 16, 2015, about 1910 eastern daylight time, a Dassault-Breguet,  Mystere Falcon 900B, N610RL, received minor damage from an inflight electrical fire. The airplane had departed Westchester County Airport (HPN), White Plains, New York about 1715, destined for the Orlando International Airport (MCO), Orlando, Florida. The two flight crew members, flight attendant, and 12 passengers were not injured. The corporate flight was being operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.According to the cabin attendant, she noticed \"a weird smell\" in the galley area and started checking the appliances. She could find nothing wrong with them and asked the pilots if they had any idea where the smell was coming from. She turned around and opened the area in the galley that they kept the glasses in, and noticed \"a glow behind it.\" The pilot then came back to assist her.  He grabbed a fire extinguisher, used it all and then asked her for another one. She handed him the second one and he was able to put out the fire. The pilot then told her to watch the area.According to the pilot, they noticed the strange odor when they were on the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) for MCO descending through 20,000 feet above mean sea level. They checked that all the ovens, microwaves, and warmers were in the \"off\" position. All were found to be \"off\" but the smell continued and then smoke appeared. The crew declared an emergency and asked for priority to the nearest airport. The pilot then \"gave the flight controls\" to the copilot who took over flying and the radio duties (the autopilot was on and engaged). The copilot then turned off the power to the cabin and to the galley. The pilot then used a fire extinguisher to extinguish fire. The fire was suppressed by getting behind the crystal storage and spraying the area with a Halon portable fire bottle. The crew decided to continue to Orlando as it had large runways with excellent fire and rescue capabilities. The landing was normal. The crew evacuated the passengers and fire personnel double checked the airplane for any signs of continued fire or hot spots. None were found.According to the copilot, they noticed a smell at first and then smoke from somewhere in the airplane when they were on the STAR for MCO at approximately 1910. They determined that it was coming from the galley area, declared an emergency, and asked for vectors to the nearest airport.   After the sight of smoke, and the cabin attendant assuring that everything was powered off, the pilot \"gave the controls\" to him.  The pilot then went back into the cabin to assist the flight attendant by spraying the galley area with the fire extinguisher.  The Halon did its job and no more smoking was noticed so they decided to continue to MCO for an \"abnormal approach and landing\" with priority from air traffic control. After landing they could see the signs of burnt wiring behind the galley.Examination of the area in back of the crystal (glass) storage area of the galley revealed the presence behind the plenum ducting of sooting and the remains of a burnt wiring bundle.Examination of the wiring bundle revealed that the bundle contained the 28 volt direct current wiring and ground wires for the cabin overhead lighting, and that the associated circuit breaker in the cockpit had been tripped. Further examination of the area also revealed that the wires had been routed over the insulation bags and not directly next to the airplane's structure, and that they had been in contact with, or in close proximity to, a soft oxygen line which had been completely burned through.Examination of the oxygen system revealed that the burned oxygen line was part of the passenger oxygen system of the airplane, and that the line was not pressurized except when the passenger oxygen system was activated during situations that would require its use; such as cabin depressurization, or the presence of smoke, or unusual odors.According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the airplane was manufactured in 1988. The airplane's most recent continuous airworthiness inspection was completed on April 13, 2015. At the time of the accident; the airplane had accrued approximately 9,949 total hours of operation.Portions of the wiring bundle and the burnt oxygen line were retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

Shortly thereafter, the pilot noted that the main rotor RPM was not increasing and that she had inadvertently applied only partial power for the recovery.  The instructor pilot lowered collective, increased power and performed a straight-in run-on landing.  The helicopter touched down 3-4 feet beyond the numbers on runway 35.
