The first flight of the day he flew around the airport traffic pattern one time and landed uneventfully. During the second flight, he stated that the engine was showing signs of possible water contamination in the fuel. He landed and sumped the fuel tanks, which showed no indication of water in the fuel. Along with his mechanic, he did an engine run up, checking the magneto drop and carburetor heat application, and the engine ran smoothly.The pilot said that during the third takeoff, as the airplane climbed to about 300 to 500 above the ground (agl), the engine began sputtering and losing power.

About 300 feet above the ground, the flight crew heard a loud sound from the engine compartment, which was immediately followed by a loss of main rotor rpm. The crew subsequently performed an autorotation to the water below, and upon contact with the water, the installed flotation devices deployed. Examination of the helicopter's reduction gearbox revealed an approximate 3-inch by 9-inch exit hole centered at the top of the reduction gearbox, and its output drive gear had fractured. Metallurgical examination of the fractured pieces of output drive gear revealed features that were consistent with fatigue. The crack initiation site was identified along the outer rim section of the gear, at the root of one of the gear teeth. Even though the crack initiation site was heavily damaged, features indicative of intergranular cracking transitioning to a transgranular fatigue crack propagation were noted. No anomalies or foreign material were noted at the crack origin. The location and size of the intergranular cracking area was within the carburization layer specified by the manufacturing print. Examination of the remaining output drive gear teeth revealed a total of six additional secondary cracks that were localized around an approximate 22-degree arc near the initial fracture location and located in the same general tooth root location as the initial fatigue fracture. The secondary cracks were examined in detail, revealing the presence of fatigue, plastic deformation, and oxidation near the origins of the cracks, which are clear indications that the cracks initiated and propagated prior to the complete failure of the output drive gear. The existence of multiple fatigue-type cracks implied that the cracking was likely the result of a systematic part anomaly or defect, rather than a localized defect, since no such defect was detected in the fracture surface of the secondary cracks. The proper material composition, case hardness and depth, and grain structure along with no evidence of a material process issue indicated that the failed output drive shaft was manufactured as intended. Chemical analyses were conducted on the primary and secondary fracture surfaces to determine if any of these detrimental impurity elements were present and in quantities sufficient to cause a weakening of the material and lead to the initiation of the fatigue crack. Hydrogen content on the primary fracture surface was reported as 1 part per million. Hydrogen concentrations of a few parts per million dissolved in the steel could cause hairline cracking and loss of tensile ductility. Since hydrogen could diffuse out of the part easily under certain conditions, there was no way to definitively determine what the hydrogen level at the fracture surface was at the time of the crack initiation; however, the hydrogen concentration level found on the fractured tooth was in the general neighborhood where hydrogen embrittlement could occur. Thus, embrittlement was considered as a possible contributor to the fatigue failure. Embrittlement is a loss of ductility and/or toughness of a material and in steels could take various forms. Embrittlers such a hydrogen, phosphorus, and nitrogen, could be detrimental to the desired mechanical properties and are typically grain boundary embrittlers that produced low energy, intergranular ductile fractures.Cracks caused by hydrogen embrittlement often originate near or at the surface, usually do not branch, and the crack path could be either transgranular or intergranular and could sometimes change from one plane to the other as it propagated. The output drive gear fatigue crack found on the primary fracture surface was a single crack located at the surface that initially propagated intergranularly then transitioned transgranularly prior to failing in overload. This was consistent with a hydrogen embrittlement induced fatigue crack. Hydrogen uptake could come from a various sources, including the electrochemical plating processes, which the output drive gears experienced three times. In order to prevent hydrogen embrittlement, hydrogen that was picked up during the plating process was driven out by a process called dehydrogenization. Review of the manufacturing production order showed that after each of the three plating operations, the output drive gears was subjected to a dehydrogenization process.",
            "probable_cause": "The fatigue fracture of the reduction gearbox output drive gear, which resulted in the loss of power output from the engines to the helicopter rotor blade system and a subsequent forced landing. The fracture of the output drive gear was caused by a fatigue crack that originated in a helical tooth root most likely as a result of hydrogen embrittlement during the manufacturing process."

When the pilot tried to pull up on the collective, it would not move and both pilots saw that the collective down lock had engaged.  Both pilots attempted to unlatch the collective, but they were unsuccessful.  With the collective locked at flat pitch, the helicopter impacted the ground  hard in a level attitude with some forward speed and it rolled over.  Post accident investigation revealed the helicopter was equipped with an aftermarket avionics control panel.  The collective lever lock is installed on this control panel console; it is a spring steel plate with a hole in it to capture the collective locking tab.  The lock also has a rubber grommet below the locking hole to dampen any vibration.  With the collective in the full down position, the aftermarket console has about a 1/16-inch clearance between the lock plate and the collective lock tab, while the Eurocopter stock console panel has a 1/2-inch clearance.  Exemplar aircraft with both the stock and aftermarket consoles were examined.  In some of the aircraft, the grommet was not touching the console.  This condition would allow the locking lever to vibrate and also decrease the clearance between the locking plate and the locking tab.  This accident is the second known accident where the collective lock has inadvertently engaged in-flight with this particular aftermarket avionics panel installed.",
            "probable_cause": "The inadvertent in-flight engagement of the collective down lock, which resulted in an uncontrolled descent and ground impact.  The collective down lock engagement was likely due to a combination of the reduced clearance between the lock plate and the collective with this avionics panel design, the collective down lock alignment/adjustment, and the tendency of the flexible lock plate to vibrate with the natural harmonic rhythmus of the helicopter."

The captain authorized the first officer to fly the route between Honolulu and Lihue during which no mechanical abnormalities were experienced.  Approaching Lihue, daytime visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and the first officer continued as the flying pilot.  He established the airplane on a 3-degree descent profile toward the runway, with stabilized engine thrust and with a stabilized rate of descent.  The digital flight data recorder (DFDR) indicates that, about 1 second before touchdown, the airplane's rate of descent was approximately 384 feet per minute, which was higher than normal, and the pitch attitude was at 8 degrees nose up.  The hard landing and tail strike dislodged several passenger cabin oxygen masks from their ceiling storage compartments, and it also resulted in deformation to the aft empennage that was not immediately apparent.  Subsequently, the DFDR readout indicated that during the impact sequence the airplane's maximum recorded vertical acceleration was 2.33 g's.  The flight crew reported not observing damage to the airframe during a post-flight walk around, whereupon they departed with passengers and thereafter made several additional flights.  During the follow-up maintenance examination, the airplane's tail bumper compression indicator was found in the normal (horizontal) position, having been compressed about 2 7/8 inches.  By design, tail strikes that result in 3 or more inches of compression to the tail bumper reposition its indicator from a horizontal to a vertical position.  This serves as an additional visual aid alerting personnel of the severity of the tail strike event.  The first officer had completed his initial operating experience (IOE) training and had been released to fly the line 5 days prior to the accident.  However, according to the Hawaiian Airlines Flight Operations Manual, and associated Federal Aviation Regulations, because he only had about 61 of the requisite 100 hours of DC-9 flying experience, he was not authorized to land at the Lihue Airport.  Additionally, he was obligated to so inform the captain of his limitation.",
            "probable_cause": "The first officer's delayed and misjudged landing flare resulting in a tail strike and hard landing.  Contributing factors were his relative inexperience flying the type of airplane, and the captain's and the first officer's failure to adhere to required company procedures and Federal Aviation Regulations."

In accordance with abnormal procedures checklists, and guidance from the company, the crew elected to use the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist to prepare for landing at the destinationAfter pulling the main gear release handle and the nose gear release handle the crew observed that the main landing gear indicated down and locked with green indicator lights, the nose landing gear did not indicate down and locked, and the red Nose Gear Unsafe light was illuminated.  The crew landed the airplane with the main landing gear down and the nose landing gear retracted, and the airplane came to rest on the main gear and forward fuselage on the runway.Post-accident, the nose gear was successfully extended multiple times using the alternate extension handle and the landing gear was also extended multiple times under hydraulic power with no anomalies noted.  Testing of landing gear system components did not reveal any failures that should have prevented the gear from extending via the alternate extension method.  The pull force required to extend the nose gear alternate release handle to a position where the nose gear released from the up and locked position was measured at approximately 72 lbs.According to manufacturer's design requirements, the pull length on the alternate release handle should be approximately 11 inches with a force of 90 pounds.A post-accident review of the alternate gear extension procedures was conducted in a full flight simulator by the investigation group with the participation of the accident flight crew.  The pull force required and the pull length required to extend the nose gear using the alternate extension handle was determined to be significantly lower in the flight simulator as compared to the aircraft. There was no guidance contained in the alternate landing gear extension procedure specifying required pull forces when using the alternate extension handle.

He departed on a local flight with a private pilot who had accumulated approximately 605 hours of total flight experience, which included about 450 hours in make and model.  The private pilot said the student pilot flew the majority of the flight, and was manipulating the controls during the accident.  The student pilot entered the traffic pattern for landing on a 2,750-foot long, turf runway.  According to the private pilot, the student pilot's first landing approach was \"way too high\" and resulted in a go-around.  During the second landing attempt, the airplane \"seemed right on glide slope,\" when it \"suddenly dropped down\" and impacted power lines.  The private pilot stated he attempted to reach for the controls and apply engine power, but was too late.  The airplane struck the top of a utility pole and power lines, which were located about 250 feet prior to, and in-line with the approach end of the runway.

The last radar target, about 2.8 miles east of the accident site, showed the airplane in a slow climb, about 11,200 feet mean sea level (msl), heading west. There were no witnesses to the accident and no reported distress calls from the airplane. A search was started when the airplane did not arrive at its destination, and 2 days later, the airplane was located about 300 feet below the top of a 12,300-foot ridgeline. Postaccident examination revealed ground scars and damage to the airplane indicating that it impacted the ground relatively flat and wings-level on an upslope heading, which is consistent with it being in a wings-level climb. No preimpact anomalies were discovered with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. The nearest weather reporting station was located at the departure airport about 65 miles northeast of the accident site, and visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of departure. Because the accident occurred in a remote area in rugged mountainous terrain, the precise weather conditions at the time could not be determined. However, hikers who were in the area of the accident site about the time of the accident reported dense fog and cloud obscuration along the ridgelines on the airplane's flightpath. These observations suggest that the airplane encountered deteriorating weather conditions once it climbed above 11,000 feet msl. Further, these observations, combined with the physical evidence indicating the airplane was in a wings-level climb at impact, are consistent with the pilot continuing flight into clouds and/or fog and losing visual contact with the terrain, resulting in the airplane impacting the slope in controlled flight.",

Fatigue originated at machining discontinuities on the inner surfaces of eye holes at the bushing ends, which had been punched in the plates during the manufacturing process. In 1977, Airworthiness Directive (AD) 77-07-08 & Fairchild Hiller Service Bulletin (SB) FH1100-55-2A were issued to inspect for this problem.

While in cruise flight, the engine began to run rough and lose a significant amount of power.  The pilot attempted corrective measures (applying and removing carburetor heat and releasing the banner), but the airplane continued to lose power.  The engine was not producing enough power for continued flight and the pilot landed in the water short of the beach.  When the airplane hit the water, it nosed over and came to rest inverted.  Post accident examination revealed that the number 4 piston had fractured around the circumference of the piston just above the connecting rod pin and had beach mark signatures consistent with cyclic fatigue.  Fractured pieces of the piston were found in the oil sump.  The aft piston pin end cap was worn and burnished.  The forward piston pin end cap separated from the piston pin, with fracture surface signatures consistent with overload.  The rod journal bearing was also worn and burnished.  The number 4 connecting rod journal of the crankshaft was cracked and the connecting rod cheek on the crankshaft was fractured perpendicular to the rod journal.  The journal cheek fracture exhibited beach marks consistent with cyclic fatigue.  The fracture had an irregular shape that provided a \"key\" that maintained rotational continuity of the crankshaft during operation; however, the fracture also allowed the crankshaft to flex.  Flexing of the crankshaft induced a rotational misalignment of the connecting rod, which in turn induced the cyclic fatigue failure of the piston.  This condition was likely on-going for some time prior to the final fatigue failure.  Copious amounts of small metal debris and flakes were retrieved from the oil pressure filter screen that were consistent with the rod end cap bearing material and should have been apparent if the screen and filter were being checked for contaminants on a regular basis.  Lycoming Mandatory Service Bulletin (SB) No. 480E recommends an oil change, pressure screen cleaning and oil sump screen check at 25-hour intervals.  The SB continues that observation of abnormal metal content during the service may indicate additional service is required.

The following information was extracted by the NTSB Medical Officer, from the report of autopsy performed on the pilot by the Office of the District Medical Examiner in Fort Myers, Florida:  - Under \"Microscopic Examination\" is noted, \"LIVER: Cirrhosis, portal triads with chronic inflammatory cells, micro and macrovesicular steatosis and focal areas of congestion.\"  The most common symptom of chronic hepatitis C is fatigue.  Interferon therapy is often used in individuals with hepatitis C, and had been prescribed by the VA for the pilot.  There were, however, no recent medical records to suggest that the pilot had continued that therapy or to indicate how his liver was functioning at or near the time of the accident.  The autopsy findings indicate that his disease had progressed to cirrhosis, but the cirrhosis was not noted to be severe.  FAA Aviation Medical Examiners are instructed to deny or defer medical certification to the FAA Aeromedical Certification Division for any airmen who have chronic hepatitis with impaired liver function.

The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.Witnesses reported that the pilot had been assisting with the production of a film throughout the afternoon, and that the purpose of the accident flight was to take video footage from the air. After departing from the grass runway, the airplane entered a circular orbit to the left. The airplane had completed three circuits, when during the fourth, it entered a rapid descent as engine power increased. During the descent, the wings rolled nearly level before the airplane impacted the ground in a nose low, slight left bank attitude.The final two seconds of the flight were captured on video from the ground. Review of the video footage showed a final descent and impact that coincided with the descriptions provided by witnesses.

Borescope examination of each cylinder showed no evidence of any abnormal wear or combustion deposits. Each spark plug electrode appeared gray in color and displayed normal wear. Rotation of each magnetos' input shaft produced spark at all terminal leads. All four fuel injector nozzles were absent of any obstructions.

The purpose of the flight was a check ride with a designated pilot examiner (DPE) for the pilot's private helicopter rating.  After completing a series of maneuvers, an autorotation was initiated.  According to the DPE, the entry and flare were uneventful, and the pilot applied power to recover; the engine rpm and rotor rpm needles were \"in the green.\"  The pilot then began to cushion the descent with collective.  During this cushion, the low rotor rpm horn activated.  The check pilot expected the pilot to lower the collective slightly and roll on additional throttle; instead, the pilot lowered the collective \"almost all the way down\" and rolled some throttle off.  At this point the helicopter was very close to the ground.  The check pilot told the pilot \"I have the controls.\"  The helicopter entered a right turn and the check pilot intended to \"let the aircraft continue into a slow right turn and milk whatever power we had to fly out of it.\"  At this time, the check pilot felt the right pedal move against his foot, and the helicopter settled to the ground at an angle.  After bouncing once, it touched down on the left skid, and rolled over.   After the accident, the check pilot asked the pilot if he had been rolling the throttle off as he was pulling the collective up during the cushion portion of the autorotation.  The pilot reported in the past, he had been over speeding the engine so he would slightly reduce the throttle to compensate.   The pilot applied left pedal when he was attempting to align the helicopter with a track.  No mechanical discrepancies were noted with the helicopter prior to the accident.  The density altitude was 8,393 feet mean sea level (msl).",

Factors in the accident were the pilot's failure to completely relinquish the controls, and the high density altitude environmental condition."

The flight departed for the first banner tow flight of the day, returned to the departure airport after flying the banner, dropped it, then picked up a second banner on the No. 3 position.  He flew the banner then returned to the departure airport and dropped it with no reported discrepancies.  A company employee reported that the pilot released the second banner late and after landing when asked why, the pilot advised him the No. 3 release wasn't working properly.  The pilot installed banner tow hooks at the Nos. 1 and 3 positions, and departed to pick up a billboard using the No. 1 position but reported the airplane would not climb, and he released the banner.  He then threw out the hook for the No. 3 position, and returned to pick-up the billboard which was set up for an easterly direction.  He approached the location at 85 mph, and the climb-out, \"...was even worse.  I had no thrust or power at all, only the momentum carried me up to 200 [feet] where I leveled off with an airspeed of about 55 mph and noticed low oil pressure while losing altitude.\"  He immediately pulled the No. 3 banner release handle but \"everything came out the panel.\"  He then felt \"pulled by the tail with no thrust\", and braced for impact on the airport property.  No ground crew members reported hearing an engine discrepancy during the climb out.  Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the tow rope remained secured to the No. 3 tow-release hook.  A safety link designed to break at 650 pounds was installed between the tow-release hook and the tow rope.  The operator reported that the safety link will not break due to a \"hot hook\", or a banner dragging on the ground.  Also, the No. 3 banner release handle/cable assembly was separated from the instrument panel and extended into the cockpit approximately 12 inches.  The cable was not fractured; the cable housing was secured by a plastic tie-wrap near the pilot's seat, then by 3 adel clamps.  The closest adel clamp to the cockpit was located approximately 10 feet aft of the plastic tie wrap.  The cable housing was required to be clamped by 6 adel clamps.  Postaccident operational testing of the engine revealed it produced approximately 2,400 rpm (near full static) with a serviceable propeller installed.  The oil pressure was noted to be in the green arc when operating above 1,700 rpm, but was indicating low with the engine operating at 1,000 and 1,300 rpm.  A METAR taken on the airport approximately 5 minutes after the accident indicates the wind was from 270 degrees at 7 knots, though the ground crew set up for an east approach.  The operator's \"Training Manual & General Operating Procedures\" revealed that with respect to \"Downwind Pickups\", it states, \"Downwind pickups are not to be attempted by any pilot at any time!  Failure to abide by this rule will result in the pilots' immediate termination!\"  The training manual also indicates with respect to downwind pickups that if the wind direction changes and, \"...your banner is no longer set up into the wind you must land, taxi to the banner area, and help the ground crew realign your banner for an upwind pickup.\"",

The mechanic maneuvered the helicopter for about 1 minute and then stated that he was transferring control of the helicopter back to the pilot. Two seconds later, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) cut off. About 1 minute after the CVR cut off, the pilot made a routine radio call to the tower controller that he was returning to land. Two minutes after this call, the pilot radioed the tower controller and his company\u2019s dispatcher, stating that he had a problem and would be landing off-airport immediately. Several ground witnesses noticed the helicopter as it flew toward the accident site, and it was making an unusual noise, described as grinding, screeching, or whistling. The helicopter impacted with a high vertical descent rate and a postcrash fire ensued.Examination of the helicopter revealed that the main rotor and tail rotor systems had low rotational energy at the time of ground impact. Two of the tail rotor blades (yellow and red) were fractured adjacent to the tail rotor hub. The fracture signatures on the red/yellow tail rotor spar assembly were consistent with the red tail rotor blade spar initially fracturing and the red tail rotor blade departing from the tail rotor. The resultant imbalance of the tail rotor fractured the tail gearbox (TGB) output housing studs and most likely tripped the CVR g-switch, which cut off the CVR.\u00a0The yellow tail rotor blade spar fractured due to high centrifugal forces as a result of the imbalance, and the yellow blade departed from the tail rotor; the tail rotor was then rebalanced.\u00a0The two remaining tail rotor blades continued to provide partial tail rotor anti-torque, and tail rotor drive remained continuous through the TGB.\u00a0The entirety of the red and yellow blade separation event likely occurred very quickly, with only a momentary bump or vibration at the time of blade separation.\u00a0\u00a0 As the TGB output housing began to separate from the center housing, the gears likely began going out of mesh, allowing the output bevel gear to eventually contact the TGB center housing. This condition likely resulted in the loud, unusual noise reported by witnesses, as well as a drag force on the tail rotor drive system. As the pilot attempted to land, he likely shut the engines down in conjunction with an autorotative landing. Because the tail rotor drive system and main transmission remained mechanically linked, when the engines were shut down, it is likely that main rotor speed (Nr) degraded due to the compromised TGB. As a result, the helicopter developed a high vertical descent rate until ground impact. The red blade spar fracture signatures were consistent with a fast-growth failure mode. Plausible fast-growth failure modes that were examined included a discrete impact event (e.g. object strike), anomalous operation of the pivot bearing, and a fracture of the pitch horn box (the structure which attaches the pitch horn to the blade and to which the pivot bearings and bumper attaches). With the lack of available evidence because the red blade was  not recovered, the specific failure mode could not be determined during the investigation.\u00a0 \u00a0",
            "probable_cause": "Fracture of the red tail rotor blade spar, which resulted in the separation and departure of the red tail rotor blade from the helicopter and subsequent compromised tail gearbox.\u00a0The red tail rotor blade was not recovered, thus the cause of the initial fracture could not be determined."

While the airplane was at 2,000 feet mean sea level, about 10 miles from the airport, the PIC did not see the airport; however, the SIC observed the airport beacon, but not runway 33R. The controller then offered either a clearance for a visual approach to runway 33R or a vector for the runway 33R instrument landing system (ILS) approach. The PIC indicated to the SIC that he wanted the ILS; however, the SIC stated that he saw runway 33R and asked the PIC if he saw it, to which he replied no. The SIC then told the controller that they had the runway in sight. The PIC subsequently stated to the SIC that he saw runway 33R, but he confused it with runway 28.About 2 minutes later, with the SIC assisting, the PIC visually acquired the correct runway. At that time, the airplane was about 6 miles from the runway, at 1,400 feet msl. The airplane made a left turn, followed by a right turn, which positioned it from a final approach to runway 28, to a final approach to runway 33R. The airplane was lined-up for runway 33R about 4 miles from the runway threshold, at 1,000 feet and 145 knots groundspeed. While on short final approach, about 300 feet agl, the airspeed went below the landing reference speed (Vref) by about 3 to 5 knots. The SIC responded by emphasizing \"below Vref\" two times, followed by \"power\" four times. The PIC added power and the airplane's speed went above Vref by about 10 knots. The airplane touched down about halfway down the 5,000 foot-long runway, about 140 knots groundspeed with an approximate 5-knot tailwind. Although the flight crew did not believe the thrust reversers activated, non-volatile memory (NVM) of the engine controls revealed that they deployed for 13 seconds; however, the airplane still traveled off the end of the runway and came to rest in mud about 200 feet from the departure end.

The pilot acknowledged, then contacted the ATCT local controller (LC) and stated they were on the VOR-A approach outside of the final approach fix (FAF).  Two minutes later the POMR controller, after observing the aircraft's target off course, contacted the LC to ask why the airplane was circling the airport.

The pilot replied that he wanted to continue and the LC told him to report the runway in sight.  The LC, who was monitoring the flight's target track on the tower's DBRITE radar display, also informed the pilot that they appeared to be west of course.  At 1932:20 the LC asked if they had the airport in sight.  The pilot replied they had the airport in sight.  The LC then contacted POMR and advised that the pilot was canceling IFR and had the airport in sight.  The POMR controller then dropped the accident airplane's data block from his radar display.  47 seconds later, the LC  asked the pilot to confirm he had the runway in sight.  The pilot replied in the negative.  The controller then asked if the pilot wanted the missed approach.  The pilot replied that he had the ground and a freeway in sight.  The pilot was instructed to continue and report the airport in sight.  A few seconds later the pilot again reported the airport in sight, and was cleared to land runway 26L.  At 1934:25 the LC asked the pilot what he was doing and if he had the airport in sight.  The pilot asked if anything was wrong.  The controller advised the pilot he was now three miles west of the airport and suggested he turn to a heading of 080-degrees.  The controller also told the pilot to maintain visual flight conditions, and to report the runway in sight.  At 1936:02 the controller advised the pilot the airport was 1.5 miles at the pilot's 12:00 o'clock position.  He also asked if the pilot had the airport in sight.  The pilot replied negatively.  The controller instructed the pilot to make a 10-degree right turn to enter the downwind.  The controller again informed the pilot that the airport was a little over a mile at their 12:00 position.  The pilot replied he had the airport in sight.  The controller instructed the pilot not to lose sight of the airport again, and cleared him to land.   After observing the flight deviate from a track to the airport, at 1939:29 the controller asked the pilot for their current heading.  The pilot then requested a missed approach.  The controller instructed the pilot to execute the missed approach and to standby for a frequency change.  The LC then called the TRACON sector controller and a discussion ensued between the two about the flight's VFR versus IFR status, with the TRACON controller saying that he thought the pilot had cancelled IFR and went VFR.  The LC controller stated that \"he had cancelled, he had the airport in sight, he lost sight of the airport, and he is asking me now if he can go missed approach so I don't know what to do with him.\"  The Local Controller said he could work the pilot and try and get him back to the airport unless POMR wanted to take him.  POMR stated that if the pilot was IMC and did not have the airport in sight that \"I would have him turn southbound immediately.\"  The LC then told the pilot to turn south and climb immediately to 5,000 feet.  There was no response by the flight.  Review of the recorded radar data disclosed that beginning at 1933:10 (about 5 minutes before the accident), the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) system was flashing an alert on both the TRACON controllers display and the DBRITE display in the tower; however, after the TRACON controller dropped the airplane's data tag the MSAW alert was automatically suppressed at the TRACON.

The tow plane pilot was forced to cut the tow rope due to the severe pitch down moment caused by the glider.  The glider then arced over into a 45-degree nose down dive and hit the ground.  The glider's flight control system was equipped with Hotalier quick disconnect fittings at various locations to facilitate the disassembly of the glider for trailer transport.  A postaccident examination of the flight control system disclosed that the elevator control push rod was disconnected from the elevator at a quick disconnect fitting in the vertical stabilizer.  There was no damage noted to the elevator bell crank or the terminal end of the elevator control push rod.  A close friend and former partner in the glider was interviewed.  He was present on the day of the accident and knew the pilot very well.  He stated that he and the pilot had purchased the glider a little less than a year prior to the accident.  The pilot had flown it over 50 times and had assembled it as many as 25 times.  On the day of the accident, he and the pilot completed a control check while qued for the tow plane.  He stated that he held the elevator while the pilot applied full up elevator control input.  He felt the elevator move in the up position.  He said neither the pilot nor he attempted to apply full nose down control input, as it was assumed the elevator was properly attached to the control rod fitting.  He stated that in retrospect, the only way to positively check the connection is to hold the elevator in the up position while the pilot applies full nose down control input.",

He attempted to return to the airport to land, but determined that he was not going to reach the runway so he elected to land on a dirt field.  He flew under power lines that were in his flight path and attempted to flare the airplane prior to it impacting the terrain.  The airplane was equipped with Teledyne Continental GTSIO-520 engines.  Post accident examination of the right engine revealed that all of the teeth on the starter adapter gear and several of the teeth on the crankshaft gear were missing.  Several gear teeth and metal filings were located in the oil sump.  The torsional damper to shaft gear woodruff key was sheared.  The torsional damper was placed on a test bench to determine the damping time.  The consecutive tests averaged a damping time of 6.9 seconds.  The damping time of a new damper is min/max 1.5 to 3.125 seconds.  Metallurgical examination revealed 15 starter gear teeth and 11 crankshaft gear teeth were fractured near their root.  No indications of preexisting cracking were noted.  At least two of the starter gear teeth and several of the crankshaft gear teeth displayed spalling and wear at the pitch line of the teeth.  On June 13, 1994, Teledyne Continental issued a Mandatory Service Bulletin, MSB94-4, addressing the possible failure of the starter adapter gear and/or crankshaft gear on GTSIO-520 and GIO-550 engines.  On October 31, 2005, Teledyne Continental issued revision, MSB94-4G.  The service bulletin called for an inspection of the starter adapter viscous damper and shaft gear backlash every 100 hours of engine operation, and a visual inspection of the starter adapter shaft and crankshaft gear teeth for spalling, pitting, and wear, every 400 hours of engine operation.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2005-20-04, effective November 1, 2005, requiring compliance with the Teledyne Continental Mandatory Service Bulletin.  Maintenance records showed the mandatory service bulletin had been complied with when the right engine was overhauled and installed in March 2001.  There was no indication in the maintenance records that either the mandatory service bulletin or the AD had been complied with since the engine was installed.  The engine had a total time of 541.9 hours at the time of the accident.  The pilot did not follow the published emergency procedures.",

At the time of the accident, a convective weather significant to the safety of all aircraft (convective SIGMET) was in effect for the pilot's route of flight, and the information about the convective SIGMET was broadcast to the pilot by air traffic control (ATC).  Several airplanes in the vicinity of the accident airplane were deviating around weather.  Conversations between the accident pilot and the ATC controller were consistent with the accident airplane's weather radar functioning, and the possibility that the accident airplane's weather radar was providing more information than the ATC weather radar.

As the flight neared its destination airport, the pilot reported via the airport's common traffic advisory frequency his intent to land. Witnesses reported that, as the airplane overflew them on approach to the airport, it appeared to be in distress, trailing black smoke with the engine \"sputtering.\" The airplane subsequently impacted a light stanchion about 1,300 feet short of the intended landing runway. Before coming to rest, the airplane struck a house and several parked cars, and it was nearly consumed during a post-impact fire. Postaccident examination revealed a catastrophic failure of the airplane's engine, which originated with a fatigue failure of the number 2 cylinder exhaust valve. The fatigue failure was likely due to abnormal loading associated with excessive valve-to-valve guide clearance resulting from valve guide wear. Typically, valve guide wear results from either overall elevated engine operating temperatures or individually elevated valve temperatures due to improper valve seating. The normal wear pattern observed on the number 2 exhaust valve seat suggested that improper valve seating was not an issue in this case. Significant exhaust valve guide wear was observed on all cylinders, with the valve guides of the generally cooler cylinders near the front of the engine showing less wear than those of the generally hotter cylinders near the rear of the engine. This overall pattern suggested a persistent elevated temperature problem, which could have resulted from either improper engine operation or an undiagnosed maintenance issue. The investigation revealed that, when performing engine cylinder differential pressure tests during required routine inspections of the airplane\u2019s engine, the contract operator utilized gauges that had not been calibrated since their purchase and did not perform the tests in accordance with the engine manufacturer's recommendations. Also, the engine manufacturer recommended that cylinder borescope inspections be accomplished in conjunction with the differential pressure tests, and there were no notations in the engine maintenance records of any visual borescope inspections of the interior of the cylinders. Further, there was no notation in the records that the fuel injection system had been inspected and adjusted per the engine manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. If properly performed, differential pressure tests and borescope inspections may have detected valve guide wear and prevented the exhaust valve failure, and fuel injection system inspections may have detected and corrected incorrect adjustment of the engine fuel system, which can result in elevated engine cylinder temperatures and lead to valve guide wear. These and other instances of non-compliance with manufacturer service recommendations discovered during the investigation indicated that the contract operator was not maintaining the airplane in a manner consistent with its \"Operator's Manual,\" which dictated that inspections of time-limited components were to be conducted in accordance with the applicable manufacturers' recommendations.",

The collision occurred in a nonmovement area ramp surrounding the G terminal.  This ramp area is under the control of a local ground control tower operated by United Airlines.  Both aircraft were under the control of the ramp control tower at the time of the collision.  The transfer of ground control responsibility from the ramp control tower to the Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Control Tower for an aircraft arriving or departing the G terminal is Spot 10.  Spot 10 is where the G-ramp intersects taxiway A.  Gate G-102 is the closest terminal gate to Spot 10 and is along the southern boundary of taxiway A.  The ANA 777 had been cleared to taxi to Spot 10 by the ramp control tower was taxing outbound past gate G-102.  The UAL 777 had been cleared by the ramp control tower to push back from gate G-102.  Review of the recorded radio communications revealed that the ramp controller did not issue a cautionary advisory to either crew regarding the movements of the respective airplanes.  The UAL 777 push back tractor driver saw the ANA 777 approach and stopped the push back just moments before the collision.

The captain, who was the flying pilot, described the first touchdown as being 'firm,' and in the runway's touchdown zone, close to the centerline.  There was a maintenance carry over (MCO) disabling the auto-spoiler deployment system, so the first officer manually deployed the spoilers upon touchdown.
