During the area surveillance radar approach to runway 35 at ROW the pilot discovered the elevator control was jammed from the ice accumulation and he was able to control his descent only by adjusting power. The pilot was late in visually acquiring the runway and decided to make a circling approach to runway 35. On the second final approach, before crossing the runway threshold, the airplane suddenly experienced an uncommanded roll to the left and the left wing and left aileron impacted terrain.

Sierra Academy of Aeronautics was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The certified flight instructor (CFI) and the student pilot were not injured. The airplane sustained substantial damaged during the accident sequence. The cross-country instructional flight departed Merced (MER), California, with a planned destination of Yolo County Airport (DWA), Woodland. Visual (VMC) meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed.Postcrash examination determined that both wing spars had been damaged, and the incident was upgraded to an accident on April 2, 2014.The CFI reported that the flight was for IFR training. The CFI and student completed one leg culminating in an instrument approach to Willows, California. The CFI stated that, at 1-2 minute intervals during 10-15 minutes of the flight, the engine rpm dropped about 100 revolutions per minute (rpm) audibly and visually on the tachometer during the flight. The airplane was in level cruise flight at 4,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The drop never exceeded 100 rpm; application of carburetor heat, testing magnetos, changing mixture, and throttle settings had no effect. After 15 minutes, the anomaly ceased occurring. The student completed an approach, executed the missed approach, and proceeded on course to Woodlands.The CFI reported that he and he student were en route to GHEER intersection on the RNAV 16 approach to Yolo County Airport. Approximately 20 miles from the airport, the student switched fuel tanks as scheduled (every 30 minutes) in accordance with the Sierra Academy checklist. They were cleared to descend to 3,000 feet to cross GHEER at or above 3,000 feet. With some distance to cover, the CFI suggested a descent rate of 200-300 feet per minute (fpm). The student reduced power, and completed the approach checklist, which the CFI verified. About 12 miles from GHEER, the airplane entered IFR conditions (a stratus cloud). As the airplane entered the clouds, the CFI suggested a higher descent rate to pass through the clouds more quickly.After 1-2 minutes in the clouds, the student pilot reduced power, and pitched slightly down to increase the descent rate. Nearly at the moment of the reduced power, the engine rpm dropped to 800-1,000 rpm, and the propeller sounded as if it were windmilling. The CFI asked the student why he cut the power completely, and the student relied that he had not. The CFI stated verbally full power, but the rpm did not change. The CFI took control of the airplane, and tried to troubleshoot as he completed a mental emergency checklist (carburetor heat, fuel selector-mixture-fuel pump combinations, fuel gauge, throttle pumping, magneto check, starter check, engine instruments crosscheck). The student confirmed all steps using the emergency checklist. The attempts to restore power were unsuccessful, and the airplane exited the cloud layer between 1,500 to 2,500 feet. The CFI declared a Mayday with approach control, as he and the student completed the emergency checklist again with no results.The crew resigned themselves to an off airport forced landing. The CFI had the student pilot call out airspeed and altitude while focusing on a landing point. During about 300 feet of the descent, the airplane began shaking violently; the airspeed indicated 60 knots, and there was no stall horn. The shaking stopped about 300 feet above ground level (agl). About 200 feet agl, the landing lights illuminated a power line, and the CFI determined that the airplane would stall if he attempted to climb over it. The CFI had the student grab a flight bag as a cushion, and turned the fuel selector off. At this point, the CFI flew under the power line, and landed just beyond it. The airplane touched down smoothly, and the CFI held the nose wheel off the ground as long as possible. A line of small tress came into view, and the CFI began to let the nose drop. The nose drop coincided with the wings hitting the trees.After the airplane came to rest, the student and CFI thought that they turned off the rest of the power sources, and exited toward the rear of the airplane. They observed that the fuel tanks appeared undamaged, there was no smell of fuel, and the airplane seemed secure. After waiting a few minutes, they approached the airplane in order to use the radio to call for assistance. They discovered that the avionics master switch was still on. Unable to establish contact with the radio, the CFI used his cell phone to contact air traffic control, and provided them with the site's GPS location. About 1.5 hours later, a helicopter spotted them, and emergency crews arrived.",

An emergency landing was conducted with a fully extended nose and right main landing gear, but the left main landing gear was not extended. The pilot reported that he was able to keep the left wing up for only a few seconds before it contacted the runway. The airplane skidded to a stop with the left wing supported by the wing flaps and the outboard leading edge slats.

The inspection further indicated that the left main landing gear door had intruded over the belly fairing and weather seal at the fracture area, and had become \"hung up\" and was not able to extend to the down position. The clearance between the left landing gear door and the belly fairing was measured while the landing gear was in the stowed position. The investigation revealed that the manufacturer\u2019s Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) did not specify the clearance measurement for zone \u201cE\u201d, which was the zone that corresponded to the fractured belly fairing. A review of the airplane\u2019s maintenance records indicated that the left main landing gear door had been replaced at the manufacturer's heavy maintenance facility in September 2007.

The pilot of the other airplane turned to avoid the accident airplane, and noticed that the accident airplane's cockpit was filling with smoke.  Oil was also seen streaming back onto the canopy.  The accident pilot requested help, and one of the other pilots attempted to guide him to a safe off-field landing.  The accident pilot was then observed to open the cockpit canopy.  Smoke and oil were seen pouring onto the pilot's face.  The accident airplane then continued to descend until impacting trees and terrain.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the engine's no. 2 connecting rod had separated and punched a hole in the crankcase.  A detailed engine exam revealed that the no. 2 connecting rod bearing substrate had delaminated from the steel backing of the bearing, thus allowing excessive bearing clearance.  This led to a failure of the rod cap bolts (due to overstress) and separation of the connecting rod from the crankshaft.  The separated rod punctured a hole in the engine crankcase, allowing oil to escape and mechanical seizure of the engine. No materials deficiencies of any engine part were noted.  The bearing type was the subject of a Lycoming Special Advisory (no. 59-800) in 2000, a Mandatory Service Bulletin (no. 547) in 2001, and another Mandatory Service Bulletin (no. 561) in 2004 which discussed delamination of the bearings for undetermined reasons, and recommended replacement of them with bearings that had \"increased durability.\"  These bulletins addressed a higher powered engine (TIO-540), and not the accident engine; however, two other instances of delaminated bearing failures from lower-powered engines (including one similar to the accident engine) were noted.  The accident airplane had a propeller installed that was not the one required for normal certification.  Additionally, the pilot frequently flew the airplane in formation, thus requiring frequent power changes (with a geared engine).  Records indicate that all 6 cylinders were overhauled and sent back to the pilot's mechanic about 6 months before the accident.   About 4 months before the accident, the mechanic changed the oil and oil filter about 20 operating hours after the cylinders were replaced.  This entry (as well as a previous oil change entry 8 months prior) did not indicate that the oil filters and screens were opened and inspected for metal debris; however, the mechanic stated that he always checked for debris.  The airplane had flown an additional 14 flights since the last oil change.  The pilot's log indicated that 7 quarts of oil were added to the engine during that time.  The final pilot logbook entry was dated one week before the accident and indicated that one quart of oil was added to the engine, at an engine time of 326.2 hours.  The logs did not reveal any unresolved discrepancies.",
            "probable_cause": "The delamination of the no. 2 connecting rod bearing for undetermined reasons, resulting in a total loss of engine power.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's inability to complete a successful forced landing due to oil on the windscreen, and smoke and oil in the cockpit as a result of the mechanical failure of the engine."

The airplane struck trees and brush before it impacted with the terrain, approximately 250 feet short of the runway. Examination of the airplane's fuel at the wreckage site revealed the presence of water in the right main fuel tank using water-finding paste.

The purpose of the accident flight was to verify proper inflight operation of the autofeather system following the maintenance work on the autofeather pressure sensing switches and a successful ground check of the autofeather system.  Air traffic control (ATC) communications recordings disclosed that the pilot called ready for takeoff from runway 2 approximately 1207, and requested to orbit above the airport at 8,000 feet (note: the airport elevation is 4,740 feet.)  The pilot subsequently reported established in a hold above the airport at 8,000 feet approximately 1213, and was instructed by ATC to report leaving the hold.  Approximately 1215, an abbreviated radio transmission, \"zero five four,\" was recorded.  The Idaho Falls tower controller responded to this call but never got a response in return from the accident aircraft, despite repeated efforts to contact the aircraft.   Witnesses reported that the aircraft banked to the left, or to the west, and that it entered a spiral from this bank and crashed (one witness reported the aircraft was flying at 200 to 300 feet above ground level when it entered this bank, and that it performed a \"skidding\" or \"sliding\" motion part way through the bank, about 1 second before entering the spiral.) The aircraft crashed about 2 miles north of the airport.  On-site examination disclosed wreckage and impact signatures consistent with an uncontrolled, relatively low-speed, moderate to steep (i.e. greater than 22 degrees) angle, left-wing-low impact on an easterly flight path.  No evidence of flight control system malfunction was found, and a large quantity of jet fuel was noted to be aboard the aircraft.  Post-accident examination of the aircraft's engines indicated that the left engine was most likely operating in a low power range and the right engine was most likely operating in a mid to high power range at impact, but no indications of any anomalies or distress that would have precluded normal operation of the engines prior to impact was found.  Post-accident examination of the aircraft's propellers disclosed indications that 1) both propellers were rotating at impact, 2) neither propeller was at or near the feather position at impact, 3) both propellers were being operated with power at impact (exact amount unknown), 4) both propellers were operating at approximately 14\u00ba to 20\u00ba blade angle at impact, and 5) there were no propeller failures prior to impact.  Post-accident examination of the autofeather pressure-sensing switches disclosed evidence of alterations, tampering, or modifications made in the field on all but one switch (a replacement switch, which had been installed just before the accident flight during maintenance) installed on the aircraft at the time of the accident.  All switches except for the replacement switch operated outside their design pressure specifications; the replacement switch operated within design pressure specifications.  Examination of the switches indicated that all switches were installed in the correct positions relative to high- or low-pressure switch installations.  Engineering analyses of expected autofeather system performance with the switches operating at their \"as-found\" pressure settings (vice at design pressure specifications) did not indicate a likelihood of any anomalous or abnormal autofeather system operation with the autofeather switches at their \"as-found\" pressure settings.  Also, cockpit light and switch evidence indicated that the autofeather system was not activated at the time of impact.  The combination of probable engine power and propeller pitch on the left engine (as per the post-accident engine and propeller teardown results) was noted to be generally consistent with the \"zero-thrust\" engine torque and propeller RPM settings specified for simulated single-engine practice in the aircraft Information Manual.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain adequate airspeed with an asymmetric thrust condition, resulting in a loss of aircraft control.  A factor was an asymmetric engine thrust condition, which was present for undetermined reasons."

He stopped en route about 4 hours later, then departed shortly before midnight (accident time zone) toward his final destination in night visual meteorological conditions. About 3 hours later, the airplane impacted trees and rising terrain during night marginal visual meteorological conditions. Radar data indicated that during the last 3 minutes of flight, the airplane flew a serpentine course at varying low level altitudes. On the morning before the accident, the pilot obtained a computer-based weather briefing, which included deteriorating weather conditions along the route, and instrument meteorological conditions beyond the accident site. The pilot subsequently received about 1 hour 30 minutes of dual instruction in the newly-purchased airplane, and following that, the instructor attempted to persuade him to spend the night. The pilot responded that he didn't want to wait because of the deteriorating weather along the latter part of his route, but agreed to stop overnight along the way. The pilot later told another person that he would continue to his destination. The time from when the pilot obtained a weather briefing until the accident was about 16 hours; however, it is unknown if or when the pilot may have rested, how fatigued he may have been, or if it affected the outcome. Although the pilot held an instrument rating, he had not flown in actual instrument conditions for about 18 years prior to the accident. Post-accident examination of the airplane's airframe, flight controls, propellers, engine assemblies and accessories revealed no mechanical anomalies, and damage to the propellers indicated that both engines were under power at impact.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various sources and may have traveled in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft incident report.The flight was level at Flight Level (FL) 400 for approximately 30 minutes. Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to FL380, where it remained for about 15 minutes. Further clearance was issued for pilot's discretionary descent to FL330. The flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions in the vicinity of cumulonimbus buildups. Upon reducing power to initiate descent the crew heard a \"popping\" noise and both engines rolled back. The crew declared an emergency, elected to divert to Jacksonville Airport, and initiated emergency procedures. All attempts to restart the engines were unsuccessful, and the crew elected to save battery power for navigation and landing. The crew executed a successful emergency landing. After landing, the Captain attempted to restart the engine, and did observe some rotation, however stopped when the temperature did not rise.Post incident examination of the aircraft, and review of crew actions indicated that the cause of the dual-engine flameout was not due to fuel exhaustion or fuel starvation. There were no open maintenance items, and post-incident evaluation and flight test of the aircraft revealed no mechanical malfunctions.  The chemical composition of the fuel was correct, anti-ice additive was present, although it was marginally below the recommended ratio, and no contamination or excess water content was found.  There was no evidence of core lock, a phenomenon in which differential cooling of engine components following a rapid in-flight rollback causes a mechanical binding of the rotating components of the engine.  In-flight testing of the right engine of the incident airplane was unable to cause a core lock condition.This flight and other BE-400A engine flameout events before and subsequent to this incident occurred in similar environmental conditions.  Pilot reports and meteorological records indicated the flights were in or near instrument meteorological conditions with convective weather cells in the area and the pilots had just retarded the power levers to initiate a descent.  Research revealed that convective storms can lift significant amounts of water into the upper atmosphere and that the blowoff from the tops of these storms can contain significant amounts of ice crystals. A post-incident study showed that the ice crystals could partially melt passing through the low-pressure compressor of the JT15D-5 engine due to the increase in temperature of the air being compressed.  Further, the study determined that with the engine anti-ice turned off, that it was possible for the ice crystals to accrete on the leading edges of the front inner compressor stator leading edges. The study also determined that if a significant build up of ice had occurred, any change in the airflow angle of incidence that would occur as power was reduced would cause any ice that had accreted on the leading edges of the stators to break away and would result in the engine surging or possibly flaming out.  The study also revealed that after the engine had flamed out, the radiant heat from the oil tank, which is in the core of the engine between the low and high pressure compressors, could cause the ice on the front inner compressor stators to melt and the water could run back and refreeze in the high pressure compressor impeller, acting like a wedge to prevent engine rotation and restart.   Research, flight tests, and bench testing revealed that a temporary ice blockage in an orifice in the combustion chamber pressure signal line could cause a sudden drop in fuel flow, much more rapidly than normal, and reduce flow to a level that would not support combustion.  The orifice was added to eliminate trapped water from the line, however this orifice was small enough to be thermally overwhelmed in the incident conditions.Pilot interviews revealed that pilots do not perceive high altitude ice crystals to be a threat to the airplane or the engines. The Beechjet's airplane flight manual (AFM), and flight crew training, did not address high altitude ice crystals prior to the dual-engine flameout events. Post-incident, Raytheon developed guidance for Beechjet 400A flight crews on high altitude ice crystals that was distributed to the 400A community via a safety communiqu\u00e9.  The NTSB recommended that the guidance provided in the Raytheon safety communiqu\u00e9 be incorporated into the Beechjet 400A AFM as well as the AFMs of other JT15D-powered airplanes (A-06-57 and 58).  The NTSB also recommended that the FAA require the operation of the engine anti-ice system whenever flights are near convective weather (A-06-56).Crew actions after the flameout were appropriate to attempt to restart the engines, notify and coordinate with ATC for an emergency diversion, and make a forced landing.  In fact, investigators found the crew's coordination and actions to be exemplary.  Investigators also found ATC's assistance to the crew was also exemplary and contributed to the successful outcome of the flight. ",
            "probable_cause": "The dual-engine flameout due to high-altitude ice crystals that had accreted onto the JT15D-5 engines' compressor vanes and were ingested into the engine when the pilots retarded the power levers, resulting in compressor surges and rapid reduction in fuel flow due to temporary ice blockage of the combustion pressure return line, and additionally preventing an in-flight restart. Contributing to the cause of the dual-engine flameout was the lack of training on the hazards of high-altitude ice crystals to gas turbine engines and guidance to the pilots to activate the engine anti-ice system in conditions where high-altitude ice crystals may exist."

The tail rotor blades were overhauled and later removed for blade delamination on July 14, 1986. The inside surfaces of the blade 'A's' skin showed longitudinal streak patterns of debris.  The skin trailing edge closure bond contained an adhesive that was bright purple in color.  During 1967-1982 tail rotor blades were bonded with FM1000; a cream or off white colored adhesive.   Since 1982, FM1000 bonded the skin and doubler and FM73, which is orange brown in color, between the root fitting and doubler.  The rivet holes in the skin were worn on the skin surfaces under the upset heads of the rivets.  No wear was visible under the manufactured heads.

A Piper was entering the traffic pattern from the west, consistent with a 45-degree entry to a right downwind for runway 22.  According to radar data, the Mooney was making a right turn toward a northeasterly direction, consistent with a crosswind to downwind leg for runway 22.  The Piper was west of the Mooney target, and appeared to converge in an easterly direction.  Three air traffic controllers were on duty at the time of the accident.  Prior to the collision, two controllers were in the cab, and one controller was in the break room.  The accident controller combined positions to let the second controller in the cab go out of the tower for a meal break.  The third controller had been out of the cab for approximately 3 hours, but remained in the break room, which left only one controller in the cab.  At that time, there were four aircraft in the traffic pattern, and the pilot of a fifth aircraft was requesting entry into the pattern.  About 10 minutes later, with six airplanes in the traffic pattern, two pilots were cut-off and two pilots performed a go-around.  One of the pilots subsequently stated that the controller was having difficulty correctly identifying the airplanes in the pattern.  The pilot of the Piper had contacted the tower, and reported that he was 7.5 miles west of the airport at 2,500 feet.  The controller instructed the pilot to report a right downwind leg for runway 22, but did not provide a sequence or traffic advisory.  Additionally, the controller spent approximately 1 minute conversing with the pilot of a helicopter.  When the collision occurred, the controller did not see it, nor did he provide traffic advisories to either pilot.  The controller thought the Mooney would be ahead of the Piper in the traffic pattern.  The weather was clear, and witnesses reported that both accident airplanes had lights illuminated.  One witness stated that the Mooney converged into the Piper from the right, at an approximate 45-degree angle.  A second witness stated that the Piper was in the traffic pattern, straight and level, when the Mooney appeared in a climbing right turn, converging on an approximate 45-degree angle.  A third witness, who was a flight instructor, saw one airplane on a downwind leg that was struck by the other aircraft turning crosswind to downwind.  The third witness added that it was possible the airplane on the downwind leg had entered the traffic pattern incorrectly.  He further stated that both airplanes were well lit, and both accident pilots should have been able to see each other.  The left wing of the Mooney exhibited several propeller strikes, cut at an approximate 45-degree angle to the wing chordline, and progressing toward the cockpit.  Toxicological testing for the pilot of the Piper revealed Butalbital in the blood and urine.

Witnesses saw the airplane take off and disappear into the overcast. Shortly thereafter, they heard an airplane make four passes over the airport. The sound became progressively louder but they could not see the airplane. On the fifth pass, the airplane was seen approximately 50 feet above the ground and it barely cleared a stand of trees. Recorded ATC transscripts revealed that the pilot contacted approach control and told the controller that he was caught in heavy fog and wanted vectors back to the airport. The airplane crashed shortly thereafter in a snow-covered field. An examination of the airplane showed impact damage consistent with having descended to the ground in an uncontrolled spin. An examination of the airplane's systems showed no anomalies. Although the pilot was instrument rated, he had not flown with instruments since receiving his rating 2 years ago.

The pilot stated he did not have any specific recollection regarding the beginning of the accident sequence.  He said that he felt the helicopter was not responding to his control inputs, \"the way it should be.\"  He also did not recall reporting any specific problems over the radio; however, review of communication recordings revealed that the pilot stated he experienced a \"tail rotor failure.\"  Another helicopter captured the accident sequence from its onboard video camera.  The accident helicopter was observed entering a steep descent and quickly leveling off.  A fairly constant, level attitude and heading were briefly maintained before the helicopter came to an unstable hover and began an approximate two revolution left rotation about its vertical axis.  During the rotation, the helicopter descended and struck the roof parapet of a 4-story building, before it impacted and came to rest on the roof of an adjacent 2-story building.  Examination of the helicopter's hydraulic system revealed that the hydraulic pump drive belt had been installed inside-out and failed due to an overload, leading to a full hydraulic system failure.  According to Eurocopter's emergency procedures for the helicopter, the pilot action following a hydraulic system failure would be to \"calmly reduce collective pitch and adjust the airspeed to between 40 and 60 knots in level flight\" and then cut off the hydraulic pressure, by moving the toggle switch located on the collective pitch lever to off.  The procedures further state that when the accumulators are exhausted, the control forces become significantly higher, but \"not unmanageable.\"  The helicopter could be controlled without the main and tail rotor servo actuators being hydraulically powered, but this would require the pilot to apply \"non-negligible\" forces that are substantially different than the forces required with the hydraulic system operating properly.  The hydraulic system toggle switch was found in the \"on\" position. The \"flat\" hydraulic pump drive belt had accumulated about 440 hours, and had a service life limit of 600 hours.  On May 11, 2004, Eurocopter issued a service bulletin which recommended the installation of a\"Poly-V\" hydraulic pump belt.  The improved belt comprised multiple longitudinal \"V\" shapes on its inner surface that mated with similar surfaces on the hydraulic pump pulley and had a service life limit of 1,500 hours.  Eurocopter recommended that all \"flat\" drive belts be replaced with the \"Poly-V\" belts. ",

He checked to see if anything was blocking it then attempted to raise it again without success. He tried a third time before calling the tower air traffic controller and reporting that he had a landing gear problem. About 1/4 mile from the runway, the pilot applied more pressure to the Johnson bar, and it clicked into place; however, the airplane immediately banked to the left. The pilot was unable to turn the yoke to the right, and the airplane continued to roll while descending, at one point approaching a 60-degree bank. The pilot declared an emergency with the tower controller and was cleared to land on any runway. He then retracted the landing gear, but the roll continued. The pilot then retracted the flaps, reduced power, and added full right rudder. He was able to stop the turn with the airplane in a left slip with about 15 to 20 degrees of left bank. After completing about 315 degrees of a 360-degree turn, the pilot saw that he was about to be lined up with the runway again. He lowered the landing gear, and with a right crosswind and left slip, the airplane touched down well left of runway centerline and came to a stop.A subsequent examination of the airplane revealed no damage. However, below the cockpit, a small flashlight of unknown ownership was found jammed between the aft side of the aft nosewheel well bulkhead and the landing gear bellcrank, adjacent to the aileron control linkage and below where the Johnson bar went through the deck. When the Johnson bar was raised, a 3- to 4-inch hole could be seen in the old, worn boot above where the flashlight was found, which likely allowed the flashlight to fall through. The airplane had been rebuilt between 2004 and 2006, and the latest annual inspection was completed in April 2010 with the airplane determined to be in an airworthy condition. Per Federal Aviation Administration Order 8130.2F, the term \u201cairworthy\u201d is not defined in United States Code; however, for an aircraft to be so, it must conform to its type certificate, and it must be in a condition for safe operation. The Order further defines the condition as being relative to wear and deterioration and states, as examples, skin corrosion, window delamination/crazing, fluid leaks, and tire wear, but nothing relating to interior items. Researched government, industry and advocacy group publications did not emphasize that the condition of interior items, such as boots and covers, could affect aircraft airworthiness.",

At 1055:49, when the pilot was handed off from SoCal TRACON to Los Angeles Center, the pilot checked in with the Center \". . . level at one one thousand.\"  At 1057:28, the pilot asked the Center controller \"what altitude you showing us at\" to which the controller responded \"not receiving your mode C right now sir.\"  At 1057:37, the pilot transmitted \"o k we'd like to climb to vfr on top, our uh altimeter just went down to uh fifty three hundred.\"  The controller approved the pilot's request to climb to VFR conditions on-top and, at 1057:54, the pilot responded \"roger we're out.\"  No further transmissions were received from the aircraft.  The airplane was equipped with a single instrument static pressure system with two heated static ports.  The static system and static system instruments were damaged or destroyed by impact and post-crash fire sufficiently to preclude post-accident testing.",

Shortly after, when the accident airplane had not arrived, he immediately notified local authorities. The airplane wreckage was located the following morning in a heavily wooded area almost directly in line with the runway. Postaccident examination of the airframe, flight control system, and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. GPS data revealed that the accident airplane entered the downwind leg of the airport traffic pattern and proceeded to turn left onto the base leg and final approach to the runway. The last three GPS data points showed the airplane at a groundspeed of about 64 knots, which was well above the stall speed. The GPS data showed that the airplane was well above the 3-degree glidepath to both the runway threshold and the precision approach path indicator location. Wreckage and impact signatures were consistent with a stall and subsequent spin and a near-vertical impact with terrain. However, the reason for the stall could not be determined.",

The flight was operating at 1,000 feet msl, when the pilot noticed a loss of engine power in the right engine.  At the same time the pilot was noticing the power loss, passengers noted a fire coming from the right engine cowling.  The pilot secured the right engine and feathered the propeller.  He attempted to land the airplane at a nearby airport; however, when he realized that the airplane was unable to maintain altitude he elected to ditch the airplane in the ocean.  Prior to executing the forced landing, the pilot instructed the passengers to don their life jackets and assume the crash position.  After touchdown, all but one passenger exited the airplane through the main cabin and pilot doors.  It was reported that the remaining passenger was frightened, and could not swim.  One survivor saw the remaining passenger sitting in the seat with the seat belt still secured and the life vest inflated.  The pilot and passengers were then rescued from the ocean via rescue helicopter and boat.  Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right engine's oil converter plate gasket had deteriorated and extruded from behind the converter plate, allowing oil to spray in the accessory section and resulting in the subsequent engine fire.  The engine manufacturer had previously issued a mandatory service bulletin (MSB) requiring inspection of the gasket every 50 hours for evidence of gasket extrusion around the cover plate or oil leakage.  Maintenance records revealed that the inspection had been conducted 18.3 hours prior to the accident.  At the time of the accident, the right engine had accumulated 386.8 hours since its last overhaul, and gasket replacement.  The MSB was issued one month prior to the accident, after the manufacturer received reports of certain oil filter converter plate gaskets extruding around the oil filter converter plate.  The protruding or swelling of the gasket allowed oil to leak and spray from between the plate and the accessory housing.  A series of tests were conducted on exemplar gaskets by submerging them in engine oil heated to 245 degrees F; after about 290 hours, the gasket material displayed signs of deterioration similar to that of the accident gasket.  A subsequent investigation revealed that the engine manufacturer had recently changed gasket suppliers, which resulted in a shipment of gaskets getting into the supply chain that did not meet specifications.  As a result of this accident, the engine manufacturer revised the MSB to require the replacement of the gasket every 50 hours.  The FAA followed suit and issued an airworthiness directive to mandate the replacement of the gasket every 50 hours.",

The pilot reported passing through instrument conditions with heavy snow and that he cleared the tops of the clouds at 7,000 feet. The pilot was then cleared to climb and maintain flight level (FL) 230. Radar data showed the airplane's altitude and course varied throughout the flight after having reached FL 230. Several times during the flight the air traffic controller questioned the pilot regarding his altitude and/or course. Each time the pilot responded that he was at the correct altitude and/or course. The radar data showed that after each of these conversations, the airplane would return to the assigned altitude and/or course. The controller then informed the pilot that, because radar showed the airplane\u2019s altitude fluctuating between FL 224 and FL 237, he was going to have to descend out of positive controller airspace. The pilot acknowledged this transmission. The controller instructed the pilot to descend to 17,000 feet. The last transmission from the pilot was when he acknowledged the descent. Radar data showed that one minute later the airplane was at FL 234. During the last minute and 12 seconds of radar data, the airplane reversed its course and descended from FL 233 to FL 214, at which time radar data was lost. Witnesses reported hearing loud engine sounds and seeing the airplane in a spiraling descent until ground impact. Postaccident inspection of the engines did not identify any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Most of the fuselage was consumed by fire; however, flight control continuity was established. Given the pilot\u2019s experience and the flight\u2019s altitude and course variations the investigation considered that the pilot may have suffered from hypoxia; however, due to the postimpact fire the functionality of the airplane\u2019s pressurization system could not be observed and no conclusive determination could be made that the pilot was impaired.",

The airplane was equipped with two main and two auxiliary fuel tanks. Only one tank at a time could be selected to provide fuel to the engine. According to the manufacturer's Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), for the flight conditions, the airplane had an endurance of about 6.7 hours, and a fuel consumption rate of about 13 gallons per hour. Contrary to the POH procedures, which specified that fuel in the auxiliary tanks should be utilized early in the flight, the pilot reported that he delayed the use of the fuel in the auxiliary tanks until about 4 hours after departure. Up to this point, he had been switching between the left and right main tanks. The pilot eventually switched to the left and then the right auxiliary tanks, but due to a suspected malfunctioning fuel quantity gauge, he switched the selector back to the right main tank. While the pilot was trying to fix the fuel quantity gauge, the engine started to miss and cough and eventually lost power. The airplane entered a descent as the pilot made several unsuccessful attempts to start the engine. The pilot conducted a forced landing on desert terrain with the landing gear retracted, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. Postaccident examination revealed that the main fuel tanks contained minimal fuel, while the auxiliary fuel tanks contained sufficient fuel for continued flight.",

The engine was reinstalled by a mechanic who made several engine runs to check for leaks and proper rigging of the engine controls.  The pilot said an engine run-up to 1,700 rpm before takeoff was normal.  Just after lift-off, the pilot said the engine did not seem to be producing full power, and the airplane would not climb above about 300 feet.  He decided to return to the airport, and when the pilot pulled the throttle control to idle, the engine power did not change.  It continued to run at less than full throttle, but he could not make any power changes, up or down.  The pilot said he descended to the runway, but since he could not reduce power, continued to fly down the length of the runway until reaching the end.  He said he was flying at low level, and did not remember to shut-off the engine with the mixture or magnetos.  Upon reaching the end of the runway, he banked the airplane to the left along a taxiway.  The taxiway abruptly ended at a six feet high fence.  The airplane collided with the fence, and then struck numerous trees beyond the fence.  The airplane received damage to the engine, wings, and fuselage.  The mechanic, and another mechanic employee observed the airplane climb to about 500 feet and then return for landing.  During the landing, the airplane touched down on the runway for about 5 to 7 seconds on the main landing gear tires.  The touchdown point appeared to be about mid-length of the runway.  The airplane then lifted off to about 40 feet until reaching the end of the runway.  It banked hard to the left, bounced the main wheels on the taxiway, and disappeared from view.  After the accident, the mechanic recovered the airplane.

About 100 yards from the pad and 150 feet agl, he noticed a twitch in the nose of the aircraft and heard the rpm decreasing and the engine spooling down.  He entered an autorotation and turned the helicopter to the right to avoid upsloping terrain.  The aircraft touched down hard and the landing gear collapsed and the tail rotor struck the ground.  The pilot stated that after coming to a stop, the engine was still idling so he closed the fuel shutoff valve and throttle and turned off all electrical power.  The engine took about 20 to 30 seconds to spool down.  The fuel control components were then tested at the Allied Signal Materials Technology Center in South Bend, Indiana, under the auspices of the FAA.  Operational bench tests performed on the fuel control and governor indicated that the fuel control would meter minimum fuel flow throughout the various test points and that the acceleration bellows assembly was the probable source for the uncommanded minimum fuel flow condition.  A leak was found in the bellows which stemmed from a corrosion pit that penetrated through the outer ply of a convolution tube at the edge of a braze fillet.  The pit caused evacuation and malfunction of the bellows.  Allied Signal and Allison Engines issued service bulletins on November 18, 1993, regarding the replacement of the fuel control bellows.  The Allison Commercial Engine Bulletin CEB-A-282 directed that the beryllium copper bellows be replaced by a stainless steel welded Pc Inconel Bellows the next time the affected fuel control was at a repair/overhaul facility and the bellows area was disassembled for any reason, but in no case later than the next fuel control unit overhaul.  The aircraft maintenance records revealed that on April 22, 1997, an overhaul of the fuel control assembly was performed.

The airplane's left wing was refueled with 8-10 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel.  The airplane was preflighted, and fuel samples were taken from both tanks, the strainer, and both wings.  No water or sediments were observed.  The pilot completed an engine run-up, then took off.  During the climb, about 400 feet above the ground, the engine quit.  The pilot switched the fuel selector from the left tank to the right tank.  The engine began to produce power again, but not full power.  The pilot opted to land at a nearby unlighted airstrip.  During the approach, while on base leg, and with the engine still running, the airplane impacted a tree.

He said he knew the winds were coming from the airplane's right side and were gusty.  The pilot said a strong gust of wind pushed the airplane toward the left side of the runway.  The pilot said he applied full right aileron control and the hand brakes as a crosswind correction.  The pilot said the nose wheel collided with a runway edge light that caused the nose wheel fork to separate from the nose landing gear strut.  The airplane nosed over shortly after that.  The Piper PA-22 series airplanes do not have individual toe brakes.  The brake system is activated by a brake handle that causes both brakes to work simultaneously.  Reported winds at the time of the accideent were 330 degrees with a steady wind at 17 miles per hour (mph) and gusts to 26 mph.  According to the regulations the airplane was certified under, its demonstrated cross wind component is 10 mph.

The airplane's nose wheel casters freely, and ground steering is accomplished by differential braking of the main landing gear wheels.  The airplane's Pilot's Operating handbook (POH) cautions pilots that when taxiing, they should use minimum power, and notes that excessive braking may result in overheated or damaged brakes.  Two months before the accident, the manufacturer issued an Owner Service Advisory (OSA), which advised pilots to not ride the brakes, which could produce excessive heat, premature brake wear, and the increased possibility of brake failure.  The airplane's maintenance records contained several entries about the brake system.  Eight months before the accident, the left brake pads were replaced, and the brake reservoir needed servicing.
