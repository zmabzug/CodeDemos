The case was previously identified under accident number SEA07LA237.The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was operating at a private airstrip used for UAS testing. The operation involved a ground-based flight crew of three pilots: a flight instructor, a student pilot, and a supplemental pilot. Additionally, an observer was present. The student pilot, who was being supervised by the flight instructor, was controlling the aircraft using the Pilot Console, which is a computer-based interface. Alternatively, the aircraft can be controlled through a Manual Pilot Console. While the accident aircraft was orbiting on autopilot, the Manual Pilot Console was used to control another aircraft that was involved in ground testing.  In order to control the other aircraft using the Manual Pilot Console, the pilot address of that specific aircraft was entered using the Pilot Console. Also, the mode switch on the Manual Pilot Console, which switches between automatic and manual aircraft control, was placed in the manual position. Following the ground testing, the Manual Pilot Console was placed on a table with the switch still in the manual position and the pilot address still set for the other aircraft. All evaluations were completed, and the accident aircraft was readied for landing due to low fuel and approaching rain. Using the Pilot Console, the student pilot initiated the automatic landing sequence.  The flight instructor's attention was distracted from the primary flight display by a request from the observer. Meanwhile, the student pilot noticed that the pilot address for the Manual Pilot Console was still on the address of the other aircraft.  Without verifying that the mode switch was in the automatic position, he changed the pilot address to the address of the accident aircraft. Changing the address with the mode switch in manual position resulted in a disconnect of the accident aircraft's autopilot. Before the supplemental pilot could pick up the Manual Pilot Console and assume control, the aircraft, now in manual mode with the autopilot disconnected, rolled to the left, entered a vertical dive, and impacted the ground. As a result of the accident, the operator incorporated a software/hardware fail-safe making it impossible to change the pilot address for the Manual Pilot Console if the mode switch is in the manual position. The switch must now be moved to the automatic position prior to making the pilot address change.",
            "probable_cause": "The student pilot's failure to follow proper procedures, specifically not verifying that the mode switch was in the automatic position before changing the pilot address, which resulted in a loss of aircraft control.

The glider pilot said he discussed the takeoff with the tow plane pilot and requested a climb at 65, though he did not specify whether the speed was in knots or miles per hour.  The tow plane departed and climbed at an airspeed that was lower than what was discussed by himself and the glider pilot.  The glider pilot realized airspeed was not sufficient and attempted to release from the tow but missed the tow release handle.  On the second attempt, the glider pilot released from the tow plane at approximately 100 feet above ground level (agl) with little airspeed remaining.  The glider then began a slow roll to the right and the pilot realized that the glider had stalled.  He applied forward pressure on the stick in an effort to regain airspeed.  Shortly thereafter, the right wing impacted the terrain and was dragged forward.  The fuselage then descended and impacted the terrain on the main landing gear.  The main landing gear structure failed as result of the impact, and the glider slid across the ground on the fiberglass fuselage.  The pilot stated that the glider had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.  A witness to the accident reported that after both the glider and tow plane had lifted off, the tow plane began a very steep climb.  The tow plane was considerably higher than the glider with a significant amount of slack in the towrope.  The glider then moved slightly to the left, which corrected for the slack.  The glider and tow plane flew at a level altitude briefly, but then the tow plane became considerably higher than the glider.  The tow plane continued to climb and the glider remained configured in a straight and level attitude.  About 100 feet agl, the glider released from the towrope and appeared to be heading straight ahead to land.  As the glider descended towards the runway, the right wing dipped down approximately 30 to 40 degrees.  The glider continued to descend until the right wing touched the terrain.   According to the data retrieved from the recorder installed in the glider, the highest altitude that the glider reached was approximately 130 feet agl; the highest airspeed obtained was approximately 45 knots.  The glider's flight manual states that the glider will exhibit certain stall characteristics while in specific attitudes.  In level and turning flight, at stall speed, the glider will begin to mush; there is no abrupt stall and the ailerons will remain effective.  When following the recommended manufacturer specified procedure stall recovery is possible in less than 65 feet.",

The flight plan was subsequently closed; the investigation could not determine the flight\u2019s last departure point and time. The airplane wreckage was found on an airport runway in Nashville, Tennessee, the following afternoon during an airfield inspection. Postaccident examination of the airplane found no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.A review of airport radar data indicated that the airplane entered the Nashville area at night almost 9 hours after its initial departure time and that the airplane circled the airport for about 2 hours before it crashed on the approach end of the runway.

Although the medical records did not include a specific psychiatric diagnosis, the pilot\u2019s prior criminal actions and impulsive behavior are consistent with antisocial personality disorder, which likely led to his impetuous decision to fly to Nashville.

When the selector handle was pointed full forward, the RIGHT tank was selected; when the selector handle was pointed straight up, the LEFT tank was selected, and when the selector handle was pointed toward the rear of the airplane (full back) the OFF position was selected.  Incorporated on the fuel selector cover (placard) was a safety button that was designed to keep a pilot from unintentionally turning the fuel selector to the OFF position.  The pilot would have to physically depress the button so the fuel selector handle could bypass it and be moved into the OFF position.  The private pilot stated that he was not aware of this safety feature and that he did not depress the safety button when he moved the fuel selector during the accident flight.  According to an FAA inspector, who performed an examination of the airplane, the fuel selector handle was found in the OFF position; however, when he moved the selector handle through its full range of motion, the handle moved freely to the OFF position without having to depress the safety button.  ",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation after the private pilot inadvertently positioned the fuel selector to the OFF position.  Contributor factors were the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing and the unreliable safety detent button on the fuel selector."

The airplane sustained minor damage and the certificated airline transport pilot sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was registered to Hunter Creek, LLC and operated by Alaska Cub Training Specialists, Palmer, Alaska, as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 instructional flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed. In statements provided to the United States Park Service and National Transportation Safety Board, witnesses stated that four airplanes, flying as a group, had landed at Pevine Bar Airstrip in the Wrangell - St. Elias National Park. To stave off swarms of mosquitos while loading the airplanes, the engines of all four airplanes were started and allowed to operate at idle, with the cockpits unattended. While loading gear on the right side of the airplane, the airplane to the left of the accident airplane, also a Piper, PA-18, began slowly moving forward. The pilot of N985W attempted to go around the front of his airplane towards the left wing to prevent the two airplanes from making contact. Subsequently, the pilot ran into the back of the spinning propeller, and was struck three times. The closest weather reporting facility is Gulkana Airport, Gulkana, Alaska, 95 miles from the accident site. At 1053, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) from the Gulkana Airport was reporting in part: wind from 040 degrees at 7 knots; sky condition, clear; visibility, 10 statute miles; temperature 52 degrees F; dew point 36 degrees F; altimeter 29.39inHG.",

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the public aircraft flight. About 7 minutes into the flight, while enroute to practice confined area operations at a field about 3 miles from the helicopter base, the crew heard an unusual noise from the engine compartment. About 250 feet above the targeted field, the crew heard a louder noise, and the engine surged twice before ceasing to develop power. The CFI then conducted an autorotation to the sloping terrain below. The helicopter sustained substantial damage, which included fuselage crushing and the partial loss of one vertical stabilizer. Data downloaded from the engine control unit revealed an overtemperature fault indication; the engine was then removed and shipped to the engine manufacturer's facility for a detailed examination. A circular metal deflector plate, which was normally affixed to the aft end of the combustion chamber liner, was found fragmented in the turbine section. The turbine blades and vanes exhibited significant damage, which resulted from the deflector plate's release into the gas path. Metallurgical analysis of the combustion chamber liner revealed that the required circumferential fillet weld between the liner and the deflector plate had not been performed; only the preliminary positioning welds attached the deflector plate to the liner, and those welds failed during normal engine operation. Maintenance records indicated that the liner had accumulated about 158 hours in service since its overhaul and reinstallation. The liner overhaul included replacement of the deflector plate; the replacement was accomplished by a repair facility that was not authorized to conduct that procedure and that also did not possess the applicable guidance. The investigation was unable to determine the specifics of why the repair facility replaced, inspected, and approved the deflector plate. Although 19 months had transpired between the improper repair and the liner's failure, the investigation did not locate any information that indicated that either the repair facility or the Federal Aviation Administration principal maintenance inspector for the repair facility was aware that maintenance personnel at the repair facility had accomplished a procedure that it was not authorized to conduct.

Having no prior time in the airplane, he flew it around the pattern to familiarize himself with the airplane's controls. The pilot stated that since he was not sure what the fuel burn of the airplane was he made an estimate using a similar aircraft with the same engine. After refueling the airplane to its 24 gallon maximum capacity, the pilot departed for the cross country flight to the destination airport. En route he climbed the airplane to 9,500 feet, leaned the mixture, and set the engine rpm to 2500. He estimated that the engine was using 4 to 4 1/2 gallons per hour, which by his calculations would give him 5 hours of flight time at that altitude. After 3.8 hours of flight, the pilot noticed the fuel gauge read 1/4 of a tank. About 6 minutes later, the engine lost power and the pilot initiated an off-airport landing.

Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local, aerial observation flight, and no flight plan was filed. The local flight was originating at the time of the accident.According to the pilot, he was assigned to fly a photographer with a local news station to the Watertown, Massachusetts area to respond to a truck accident. The helicopter was parked on a trailer and the preflight and engine start portions of the flight were normal. After checking the local wind conditions, the flight was cleared to depart by tower personnel. Shortly after liftoff, the engine abruptly lost all power. The pilot attempted an autorotation to a taxiway, but chose to land in the grass adjacent to the taxiway when it became apparent the he would not make the taxiway. During the flare and landing, the main rotor contacted the tail boom, severing it just aft of the horizontal stabilizer.

Upon entering the accident autorotation, he maintained an airspeed between 85-90 knots in the hope that extra speed would allow a more aggressive deceleration flare prior to touchdown, which should in turn further slow the rate of descent and forward speed. The helicopter's rate of descent was high, and as the PIC turned the helicopter onto the runway heading it was apparent to him that the rate of descent was excessive and that he was too low to execute either a proper deceleration flare or perform a power recovery. He attempted to level the helicopter as much as possible prior to impact to minimize the damage to the helicopter and prevent injury. The helicopter landed hard with the left skid contacting the runway first. The left skid collapsed, damaging the outboard landing gear damper attachment structure. The helicopter slid about 100 yards before coming to a stop. According to the manufacturer, the main rotor rpm range is 90 percent to 106.4 percent. At the helicopter's weight and the density altitude on the day of the accident, the main rotor rpm during the autorotation should have been above the 106.4 percent limit (red line), requiring the pilot to increase collective pitch to maintain the rotor rpm within limits. Performing autorotations at the lower part of the green arc provides less availability of rotor energy to perform an autorotation landing. The pilot should have recognized that he was not achieving the required main rotor rpm for the autorotations and terminated the maneuvers. The helicopter was within weight and balance limits.",

During landing gear retraction after takeoff, the Green hydraulic system on the airplane lost pressure, and the flight warning computer detected a flight control flaps system fault followed by a reservoir overheat condition for the Yellow hydraulic system 2 minutes later. Normal inhibition of alerts and warnings from the flight warning computer prevented notification of the faults to the flight crew until the airplane was climbing out of 1,500 above ground level. The crew subsequently experienced a period of high workload as they received multiple aural and visual warnings on the flight deck.The captain, who was the pilot flying, transferred airplane control to the first officer and began to accomplish the abnormal procedures that were displayed on the electronic centralized aircraft monitor. Accomplishing the manufacturer-recommended procedures included turning off the Green and the Yellow hydraulic systems' engine-driven pumps and the power transfer unit (PTU), resulting in low pressure in the Yellow hydraulic system (in addition to the existing low pressure in the Green hydraulic system), the airplane's reversion to alternate law in which flight envelope protections are reduced (most critically, stall protection), and autopilot and autothrust disconnection. The crew attempted to raise the flaps from position 1 (the takeoff position) to 0, but the flaps remained at position 1 because the loss of the Green hydraulic system and subsequent loss of the remaining flap control computer channel resulted in the flaps being inoperable.At this point, of the airplane's three hydraulic systems, only the Blue hydraulic system was providing useable pressure. The flight crew coordinated with air traffic control to enter a holding pattern at 12,000 feet to accomplish checklists, communicate with company maintenance and dispatch, and calculate landing distance performance using the procedures in the quick reference handbook. During this time, the captain recognized that the Yellow hydraulic system reservoir was no longer in an overheat condition and followed the appropriate procedures to restore the Yellow hydraulic system. It was restored about 36 minutes after takeoff and remained operative for the rest of the flight.To calculate landing distance performance with two inoperative hydraulic systems, the captain initially calculated a required landing distance of over 11,000 feet. After recovery of the Yellow hydraulic system, the captain calculated a revised landing distance of about 8,500 feet.The flight control flaps system fault required a higher-than-normal landing speed, and the Green hydraulic system malfunction resulted in loss of normal braking, loss of nosewheel steering on the ground, and loss of the ability to retract the landing gear once extended. Due to the system malfunctions and the inability to raise the landing gear in the event of a go-around, the flight crew decided to remain in the holding pattern to burn fuel and reduce aircraft weight below the maximum landing weight of 142,200 pounds. The airplane landed 3 hours 35 minutes after takeoff and was towed to the gate.Postincident examination of the airplane found a leak in the Green hydraulic system, in the right main landing gear door retraction flexible hydraulic line due to a kink in the line and a collapsed sidewall. An article in the June 2007 issue of Safety First, Airbus' safety magazine published for use by operators' flight and ground crews, described a scenario in which a leak in the Green hydraulic system results in that system's loss of fluid, which can lead to the loss of the Yellow hydraulic system. As the hydraulic pressure decreases and reaches a 500 psi differential between the Green and Yellow system, the PTU, by design, automatically activates and operates at maximum speed in an effort to transfer pressure to the Green system. Due to low fluid levels in the Green system, the maximum speed of the PTU results in overheating and subsequent loss of the Yellow hydraulic system within about 2 minutes.The loss of the Green hydraulic system would normally trigger a caution message that guides the flight crew to shut off the PTU. However, because the caution message was inhibited below 1,500 feet after takeoff, the PTU remained activated until the flight crew accomplished the abnormal procedures checklist.In response to previous incidents in which a loss of pressure in the Green hydraulic system led to the overheating and subsequent loss of the Yellow hydraulic system, Airbus issued service bulletins (SB) over a period of 2 to 5 years before this incident that included wiring changes and new PTU inhibit logic. The modifications were designed to prevent dual Green and Yellow hydraulic system losses in flight (mainly after takeoff) due to a low fluid level in the Green (or Yellow) reservoir followed by overheating and loss of pressure in the other system. At the time of the event, the SBs had not been incorporated on the incident airplane. Jet Blue decided not to incorporate the SBs based on available information indicating a low probability of occurrence for this type of event.",
            "probable_cause": "the failure of the right main landing gear door retraction flexible hydraulic line in the Green hydraulic system, which led to prolonged operation of the power transfer unit and subsequent overheating and loss of pressure in the Yellow hydraulic system, resulting in the airplane's operation with only one hydraulic system. Contributing to the incident was the lack of incorporation of aircraft manufacturer service bulletins that describe procedures for aircraft modifications intended to prevent this occurrence."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The student helicopter pilot was at the end of the cruise portion of a solo cross-country flight. When she was about to begin her descent to the destination airport, she noticed that the vertical speed indicator was indicating a descent of approximately 1,000 feet per minute and that the airspeed had increased about 10 knots. The pilot \"raised the collective\" control in an effort to reduce or stop the descent, but the helicopter did not respond as she expected and the descent continued. She then determined that she would not be able to reach the airport, and selected a field suitable for a landing. The helicopter landed hard in the field, and sustained substantial damage to the skids and portions of the engine mount and fuselage. On-scene examination did not reveal any preimpact failures or anomalies and postaccident testing, including runs at the engine manufacturer's factory, indicated that the engine performed normally and was capable of developing its rated power. The helicopter was equipped with hydraulically boosted main rotor flight controls which were to be used for all phases of flight. The pilot's control for activating or deactivating the hydraulic system was a 1/4 inch unguarded toggle switch located on the pilot\u2019s cyclic control stick. The accident helicopter was not equipped with any visual or audio annunciations to alert the pilot that the hydraulic system had either failed or was selected off in flight, and no such option was available from the manufacturer. According to the helicopter manufacturer's pilot operating handbook, \"Hydraulic system failure is indicated by heavy or stiff cyclic and collective controls,\" and that in the event that the hydraulic system failed or was turned off, \"control will be normal except for the increase in stick forces.\" Although some control symptoms experienced by the pilot were consistent with an inoperative hydraulic system, some were not, and no physical evidence of an inoperative hydraulic system was noted.",

During the return flight, the pilot became concerned about his remaining fuel and diverted to an alternate airport. When he reached that airport, he elected not to land because he believed that he had enough fuel to reach his home airport. As the flight continued, the engine lost power, but the pilot was able to switch fuel tanks and restart the engine. While maneuvering to land at the closest airport, all engine power was lost, and the pilot selected an off-airport, snow-and tree-covered area for a forced landing. He said that during the approach, the airplane stalled and collided with terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, lift struts, and fuselage.The pilot also reported that while en route to the alternate airport, the instrument panel-mounted carbon monoxide detector turned black. According to the carbon monoxide detector manufacturer, a positive indication for carbon monoxide would be indicated by the detector showing yellow, green, or dark blue color. Any other color would indicate that the detector was contaminated or outdated. No expiration date was recorded on the accident airplane's carbon monoxide detector. A postaccident examination of the airplane\u2019s muffler and cabin heater muff did not disclose any leaks or mechanical anomalies. Therefore, it is unlikely that there was a problem with carbon monoxide during the flight. The pilot indicated that there were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation and noted that the loss of engine power was due to fuel exhaustion.",

Radar data and wreckage distribution were consistent with the airplane making a gradual controlled descent from cruise flight and impacting mountainous terrain on a direct course toward the intended destination. No preimpact anomalies were noted during examination of the airframe and engine. The pilot's total flight time was approximately 97 hours, of which 19 hours were solo.

He had made solo cross-country flights to airports less than 50 nautical miles from his home airport, but had not yet received training in cross-country flight planning. Toxicological testing revealed that the pilot, a physician diagnosed with substance dependence, had been using cocaine and taking two prescription medications (lamotrigine and quetiapine) often used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, as well as a prescription antidepressant (fluoxetine), though the levels detected indicated he had not used cocaine within 24 hours of the accident and had likely recently discontinued use of the medications.

The approach was too high and the airplane overshot the runway. The pilot attempted a turn back to the runway; however, he had to make a sharper-than-normal turn due to wires in his immediate flight path. While performing the tighter turn, the airplane lost further altitude and the pilot had to make a forced landing adjacent to the runway on uneven terrain, coming to rest inverted. During a postaccident examination of the engine it was discovered that the number one cylinder's intake valve had deposits on the valve seat, preventing it from making a tight seal and resulting in the partial loss of engine power. No electrical problems could be identified during the examination.",
            "probable_cause": "A partial loss of engine power due to low compression from an obstructed intake valve. Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s decision to shut down the engine while in flight."

The pilot receiving training reported that he and the certified flight instructor (CFI) briefed the flight and conducted an aircraft preflight.  He reported the purpose of the flight was to practice dead reckoning navigation, and to do a grass strip landing.  He reported that the airplane operated normally and there were no indications of mechanical difficulty.  He reported the airplane touched down within 150 feet of the south end of the taxiway and he made a full stop landing.  He back taxied and then performed a \"short field\" takeoff.  He attempted to lift off at 65 knots indicated airspeed about one-half way down the taxiway, but the \"aircraft was not climbing.\"  He reported that the CFI came on the controls during the climb out.  He recalled seeing the orange balls on the power lines located at the north end of the taxiway, and he heard the stall warning horn sounding.  The airplane veered to the left, and then the right side of the airplane impacted the terrain.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook indicated that the required takeoff distance to clear a 50 foot obstacle from a grass airstrip on a 15 degree Celsius day required approximately 1,409 feet.  Runway 9/27 at the private airstrip was 2,400 feet by 70 feet.  The prevailing wind at the time of the accident was 280 degrees at 10 knots.  The inspection of the airplane revealed no pre-existing anomalies.      ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in a stall.  Contributing to the accident was the CFI's improper decision to attempt to takeoff from a short, grass taxiway instead of departing from a runway aligned with the prevailing winds, the short, grass taxiway, the crosswind, trees, and transmission wires."

He was cleared for a visual flight rules arrival, which entailed passing over a very high frequency omni-directional radio aid (VORTAC), continuing over a golf course, and then following a freeway before entering the traffic pattern. The approach controller told the pilot to proceed to the VORTAC, but the pilot replied that he wanted a vector. The controller provided a vector and the pilot said that he did not have the island in sight. The controller told the pilot to resume his own navigation. The airplane flight path crossed over the VORTAC and proceeded north into mountainous terrain instead of the cleared arrival path. While the pilot said that he was in the rain at the golf course, radar data indicate that he was actually about 2.5 miles to the east of that location. About 1 minute 20 seconds later, the pilot said that he was inbound for landing, and the controller told him that he was heading toward the mountains. The pilot immediately requested a vector \"to intercept landing,\" which was the last transmission he made. The controller told the pilot to make either a left or right turn southbound to a 180-degree heading. The airplane was substantially off course for almost 1 minute 30 seconds before impact. A group of hikers who were near the accident site heard the airplane operating in the clouds prior to impact. Weather at the time of the accident included light to moderate rain showers and reduced visibility that would have been encountered by the airplane. A postaccident examination revealed no evidence of a mechanical malfunction or failure with the airframe or engine prior to impact.Despite the pilot\u2019s two radio calls suggesting disorientation during the flight\u2019s final 90 seconds, the controller did not issue a safety alert to the pilot. Although the responsibility for flight navigation rests with the pilot, Federal Aviation Administration Order 7110.65, paragraph 2-1-6, directs controllers, in part, to \u201cIssue a safety alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is in a position/altitude which, in your judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft.\u201d The investigation concluded that the controller had sufficient information to determine that a low altitude alert was necessary, as evidenced by her attempt to turn the airplane. A timely low altitude alert may have enabled the pilot to climb and avoid the accident. When the controller recognized that there was a problem with the airplane, she concentrated on correcting his lateral track rather than helping him immediately climb to a safe altitude.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's continued visual flight into instrument meteorological conditions at an altitude insufficient to ensure adequate terrain clearance. Contributing to the accident was the air traffic controller's failure to issue a safety alert after observing the pilot's navigational deviation toward high terrain."

Airline station personnel had received authorization to call contract maintenance to investigate the oil leak from one of the airline's senior maintenance controllers.  As a result, three mechanics from a fixed base operator (FBO) at the airport were called by the airline station personnel.  The FBO had previously entered into an agreement with the airline to provide contract maintenance at the airport.  All of the airline's maintenance manuals were maintained at the airline's headquarters maintenance control base.  According to the airline's procedures, extracts of those manuals with specific procedures were required to be transmitted prior to the contractor performing maintenance, and only after authorization by the airline's maintenance control.  After becoming concerned about the delay in hearing back regarding the investigation into the engine leak, a senior maintenance controller for the airline attempted to contact airline station personnel, and the FBO, several times to determine what instructions and authorizations would be needed.  The investigation revealed that the FBO did not make contact with the airline to obtain the requested maintenance approval and required documentation to work on the engine.    Meanwhile, both sides of the engine fan cowl panels were opened by the mechanics to conduct the engine inspection and check for leaks.  The mechanics made a request to the captain (via ground-to-cockpit intercom system) for an engine run to check for the leak source.  One mechanic positioned himself on the inboard side of the right engine and the other mechanic on the outboard side of the engine.  The third mechanic was positioned clear of the engine because he was assigned to observe the procedure as part of his on-the-job training.  The engine was started and stabilized at idle RPM for approximately 3 minutes while the initial leak check was performed by the two journeymen mechanics that were working around the engine.  One of these two mechanics then called the captain on the ground intercom system and reported that a small oil leak was detected, and he requested that the captain run the engine at 70 percent power for 2 minutes to conduct further checks.  The captain complied with the request, after verifying with the mechanic that the area around the airplane was clear.  Witnesses on the ground and in the airplane stated that they saw the mechanic on the outboard side of the engine stand up, step into the inlet hazard zone, and become ingested into the intake of the engine.  This occurred about 90 seconds into the 70-percent-power engine run.  The mechanic was not wearing any type of safety equipment or lanyard to prevent the ingestion.  Upon sensing a buffet, the captain immediately retarded the power lever back to the idle position.  The first officer stated to the captain that something went into the engine and the captain immediately cut off the start lever to stop the engine run.   The mechanic who was fatally injured was hired by the FBO in November 1997, and had been a certified mechanic for 40 years.   He received maintenance training from the airline regarding on-call maintenance procedures in March 2004, nearly two years prior to the accident.  The airline provided training to contract maintenance stations in the form of classroom instruction, interactive computer based scenarios, and training videos.  Specific training (either initial or recurrent) regarding ground engine runs and associated hazards was not provided to the contract mechanics by the airline.According to the surviving contract mechanic that worked around the engine with the fatally injured mechanic, maintenance instructions were not needed for the engine run because engine oil leaks were a common occurrence, and because of his past experience as a mechanic.Under the section entitled \"Engine Run Rules - General\" in the airline's general maintenance manual, the following procedure was cited:  \"Engines will not be operated above idle at terminal or gate positions for maintenance purposes, unless specifically authorized by the local airport authority.\" At the time of the accident, a letter of agreement, dated April 1996, was in effect between the airport's control tower and the airport operations office that restricted engine power to no more than idle RPM to one engine at a time for a maximum of 5-minutes \"while on any parking or service apron areas, including the terminal ramp.\"  Additionally, about 3 months prior to the accident, on October 19, 2005, the control tower reiterated this policy via a \"Priority Briefing Item\" cover memorandum that was addressed to \"All Personnel\" at the airport.  However, the letter of agreement and priority memo had not been distributed to the airline's airport operations, the fixed based operator, or any of the tenants at the airport. Following the accident, the airline developed and implemented numerous safety enhancements, including revised procedures and training regarding ground engine runs.",
            "probable_cause": "the mechanic's failure to maintain proper clearance with the engine intake during a jet engine run, and the failure of contract maintenance personnel to follow written procedures and directives contained in the airline's general maintenance manual.  Factors contributing to the accident were the insufficient training provided to the contract mechanics by the airline, and the failure of the airport to disseminate a policy prohibiting ground engine runs above idle power in the terminal area."

Although he leaned the fuel mixture, this did not seem to increase the EGT to where he thought it should be. He therefore momentarily applied the carburetor heat and checked for a decrease in engine rpm, as is the proper procedure in an aircraft equipped with a fixed-pitch propeller. But since this aircraft was equipped with a constant-speed propeller, he should have checked for a drop in manifold pressure, which he did not do. Soon thereafter, the engine lost all power and the pilot descended to a forced landing in a soft wet field. Although the intentional gear-up touch-down was uneventful, as the aircraft slid across the field, it encountered a barbed wire fence. In a telephone interview after the accident, the pilot stated that he had been unaware that the proper procedure to use in checking for the accumulation of carburetor icing with a  constant-speed propeller was to check manifold pressure drop. He was also not aware that as ice accumulated in the carburetor throat, resulting in a gradual reduction of power, that  the propeller governor would keep the rpm constant as long as it was able to flatten the pitch of the propeller.

The airplane wreckages descended, impacted the ocean, and came to rest in about 38 feet of water. Both airplanes were destroyed, and all occupants received fatal injuries. The Cessna 172 had departed Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport about 1835, and had proceeded north.  He had contacted PBI TRACON for authorization and radar advisory service, and was assigned a transponder code of 0205.  At 1942:07, when preparing to exit PBI's airspace, the PBI controller instructed the pilot of Cessna 172 to remain on the same  transponder  code, and told him that radar service was terminated,  and to contact  Boca  tower,  \"one one  eight  point  four  two  for transition.\"  The  pilot of the Cessna 172  read  back the frequency, and acknowledged.  At this time radar indicated the Cessna 172 was about 10 miles south of PBI, and about 8 miles north-northeast of BCT.  At 1943:30 radar indicated that the Cessna 172's transponder code changed from 0205 to 1200. At 1944:25, the pilot of Cessna 172 contacted Boca Raton tower (BCT)  and  said, \"Skyhawk  four  niner  zero  three foxtrot, about  seven  miles  north  over  the  shoreline, would like to, to  Lauderdale  Executive, would like to transition your airspace please.\"  The controller said, \"zero three fox I believe that is, transition  southbound  approved, the  altimeter two  nine  nine  six, report  east.\" The pilot of the Cessna 172 read back the altimeter setting. At 1942, the pilot of the Cessna 182 had left the Bahamas , and he had landed and cleared customs in Fort Lauderdale, and was at the time of the accident continuing on to his final destination, Boca Raton, Florida.  At 1946:25, the pilot of Cessna 182 contacted  Pompano Beach tower (PMP)  and  advised  that he was \"northbound, VFR along the beach landing Boca Raton.\"  The PMP controller acknowledged  and  advised  the  pilot  to \"report passing east of the field.\"  At 1948:46, the pilot of N47DM, an uninvolved airplane, called BCT tower, and requested to taxi to the active runway.  The controller acknowledged and the pilot said he would like to pick up his IFR clearance.  During this radio communications exchange, radar indicated the Cessna 172 passed east of BCT, and there was no record of the pilot of the Cessna 172 having reported his position, east. At 1949:05, the pilot of the Cessna 182 transmitted to the Pompano (PMP) tower controller, \"reporting east of the field.\"  Radar indicted the Cessna 182 was about 2 miles east of PMP about that time.  The PMP tower controller responded and instructed the pilot to contact Boca Raton (BCT) tower, and the pilot acknowledged. At  1949:11, the  BCT  controller  read  the  IFR  clearance  to  the  pilot of N47DM,  an uninvolved pilot, and the  pilot read back the clearance.  While the pilot of N47DM was  reading  back the  IFR  clearance  on  the ground  control  frequency,  the  pilot  of  the Cessna 182 was transmitting on the local control frequency saying, \"seven five niner x-ray alpha good evening.\"  At 1949:34, on the ground  control  frequency,  the  BCT  controller  said, \"that is correct\", and less than three seconds later, on the  local  control  frequency, he said, \"roger,  no  reported traffic south, frequency change approved, good night.\" At  this  time,  radar  indicated  the Cessna 172 was  3  miles south southeast of BCT  at  1,000  feet,  and  the Cessna 182 was  2  miles  northeast  of  PMP  at  1,000  feet.    The airplanes  were  about  5  miles  apart  on  opposite courses. At  1949:44,  the  pilot  of  Cessna 182 repeated, \"even five niner x-ray alpha  good  evening.\"   The BCT controller responded, \"Cessna calling say again\", to which the pilot repeated the information, and the controller confirmed the call sign.  The pilot acknowledged and said, \"one thousand feet, VFR northbound along the beach, six and a half miles  to  the  south,  landing Boca.\"  The controller acknowledged  and  instructed  the  pilot  to  enter  and report a two mile right base for runway 5, and the pilot of the Cessna 182 acknowledged. There was no record of the BCT controller informing the pilot of the Cessna 182 of the whereabouts of the southbound Cessna 172, or of any potential traffic conflicts. At  1950:37,  radar  indicated  the Cessna 172 exited  the BCT Class  D  airspace  at  1,000  feet,  and at  the  same  time, the Cessna 182 exited the PMP Class D airspace at 900 feet, with both airplanes being less than one mile apart, and on opposite  courses.

The automated weather observation taken about 18 minutes after the accident included winds from 340 degrees at 6 knots. The pilot stated that the preflight inspection, takeoff, and traffic pattern were normal, and he had no reason to believe the airplane malfunctioned. Post-accident examination of the airplane did not reveal any pre-accident mechanical anomalies, and a Federal Aviation Administration inspector stated that the rudder, nose wheel steering, and brake systems appeared to be functional. The pilot reported 44 total hours of flight experience in all aircraft. Approximately 17 hours had been accumulated in the make and model airplane involved in the accident.

Neither the two pilots on board the airplane, nor the pilot and six passengers aboard the helicopter, were injured. The helicopter, operated by Papillon Airways Inc. (dba Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters dba Grand Canyon Helicopters) as an aerial sightseeing flight, sustained substantial damage. That flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135. The airplane, operated by Grand Canyon Airlines, was beginning a repositioning flight, and was being operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed.According to the EC-130 pilot, he was inbound from the south, and planned to land on the airport location designated as \"Spot 2,\" which was a dedicated helicopter arrival and departure location. He followed the company-designated arrival procedure, in which the helicopter flew a descending pattern first north along the centerline of taxiway A, and then west along the centerline of taxiway D to Spot 2. Spot 2 was a 50-foot painted square situated on the airport ramp. Taxiway D was 40 feet wide, was oriented approximately east-west, and comprised the southern perimeter of the same ramp. The center of Spot 2 was located about 50 feet north of the centerline of taxiway D. Since BVU was not equipped with an operating air traffic control tower, the pilot communicated his positions and intentions via radio transmissions on the BVU common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The helicopter pilot first saw the airplane when the helicopter was making the left turn from north to west near the junction of taxiways A and D. At that time, the airplane was moving south, towards taxiway D, along a taxi line just east of Spot 1, on ramp about 600 feet east of Spot 2. The airplane crew announced their intentions on CTAF to taxi to runway 15 via taxiway D. The helicopter pilot reported that the last time he saw the airplane prior to the accident was as the helicopter overflew the intersection of taxiway D and the taxi line just east of Spot 1. At that time, the airplane was turning westbound onto taxiway D. The helicopter pilot realized the potential for conflict, since the two were now both traveling westbound along taxiway D. The helicopter pilot stated that he \"immediately\" queried on CTAF whether the airplane crew had him in sight. The pilot heard a \"double click\" on the CTAF frequency, which he interpreted as acknowledgement by the airplane crew that they had him in sight. Based on this information, the pilot was convinced that the airplane was behind him and that its flight crew had him in sight.The helicopter pilot therefore continued his descent along the centerline of taxiway D towards Spot 2. About 8 to 10 seconds later, as the helicopter came almost abeam of Spot 2, the pilot began a right pedal turn to traverse to and set down on Spot 2. At the commencement of that pedal turn, the pilot simultaneously spotted the wings and nose of the airplane through his chin windows, and felt an\" impact.\" He stopped the turn and descent, transitioned to Spot 2, descended, and landed on the ramp. The flight crew of the airplane was unaware that there had been a collision, and they continued with their taxi-out and departure from BVU. The airplane was recalled to BVU by company personnel once they learned of the collision. The airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Subsequent to the company's attempt to obtain a non-NTSB sanctioned readout of the CVR, the device was obtained by the NTSB, and sent to the NTSB recorders laboratory in Washington, DC for readout. The helicopter pilot had recently been hired by Papillon, and the accident occurred on his first day \"flying the line\" for the operator. The captain of the airplane began his duty day at 0507 that morning, and the collision occurred during his sixth flight of the day. The 1656 automated weather observation at Henderson Executive airport (HND) Las Vegas Nevada, located about 13 miles west of BVU, included winds from 240 degrees at 15 knots, gusts to 19 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, temperature 40 degrees C, dew point 9 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.86 inches of mercury.",

The CFI and the student practiced two simulated engine-out maneuvers.  The CFI was reaching for the mixture control for a third simulation when he heard a loud bang.  The airplane yawed violently to the right and began to lose altitude.  The CFI turned toward his home field, but was having difficulty maintaining altitude.  He decided that he would not be able to make it to the airport, and would have to make an off field landing.  He landed in the only clear spot that he could see, which was a cemetery.  The airplane collided with monuments and a wood chip pile before coming to rest next to a mausoleum.  The right propeller hub fractured and separated.  Investigators did not recover one blade and the corresponding part of the hub.  The hub fractured as a result of fatigue cracking emanating from one of the grease-fitting holes.  The fatigue cracking originated in the area of the grease-fitting threads closest to the interior surface of the hub, at the intersection between the grease-fitting hole and the chamfer.  No material or manufacturing defect was found that could be identified as the source of the fatigue cracking.  The fatigue cracking originated just outside the thread remnants of the grease fitting hole that were plastically deformed during a chamfering process.  The grease fitting was located in a region where the wall of the hub was approximately at its thinnest, and where there was a slight change in the profile along the axis of the propeller.  These geometrical factors would have led to high stresses at the edges of the hole.  Chamfers were retrofitted to the grease-fitting holes by the manufacturer at both the interior and exterior surfaces of the hub in response to fatigue fractures that occurred in three-bladed propellers.  This accident was the first occurrence of fatigue emanating from a grease-fitting hole for a two-bladed propeller.  The chamfering was apparently introduced in an effort to smooth the stress distribution around the grease-fitting holes.  The chamfer at the interior surface should have removed the stress concentration associated with the change in wall profile, but would also have decreased the amount of material in the wall, leading to higher stresses overall.  The stress concentration associated with the grease-fitting hole and the chamfer, coupled with the location in a position where the hub wall was very thin, were likely sufficient to initiate fatigue cracking in this case.  In more recently manufactured hubs, the grease-fitting holes have been relocated to positions where the hub wall is much thicker.",
