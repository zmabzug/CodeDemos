He then departed Mansfield, Massachusetts, flew a minimum of 69 statute miles and landed at Jaffrey, New Hampshire, subsequently departing without taking on fuel and flying for approximately two additional hours.

Unable to return to his departure field, and deeming his intended landing site as unsuitable, he executed a forced landing into tree tops.  A post-crash examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed no fuel in the airplane's fuel tanks, and no evidence of fuel leakage.  The pilot stated that 'Due to the power setting I chose to run the airplane at, the length of the flight, and my negligence to visually check and only operate the airplane based on the fuel gauge readings, I believe that it was my mistake in exhausting the fuel.'

The pilot stated that he increased collective pitch, reduced the throttle on the No. 1 engine, and aborted the landing. He noted that the No. 1 engine was no longer controlled by the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system and that he had to control it manually. The pilot twice overflew the helipad, and, while maneuvering for another approach, he lost control of the helicopter, and it descended and struck a tree and the ground. Examination of the throttles, throttle linkages, engines, control systems, cockpit display system (CDS), and FADEC units revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomalies. Postaccident testing of the engines and analysis of data retrieved from the CDS and FADEC units revealed that the accident pilot had inadvertently moved the No. 1 throttle out of its neutral detent, placing the engine in manual mode and out of FADEC control. Although the pilot recognized that the No. 1 engine was no longer controlled by the FADEC, he responded with further manual throttle adjustments and did not perform the published procedure to restore FADEC control to the engine. The data showed that, as the pilot continued to manually control the No. 1 engine, he subsequently moved the No. 2 throttle out of its detent, placing that engine also in manual mode and out of FADEC control. With neither engine under FADEC control, the pilot attempted control of the rotor rpm while controlling both engines manually. This configuration resulted in a high-workload scenario in which it would be particularly challenging for the pilot to control the helicopter during the maneuvering and approach-to-land phases of flight. The accident helicopter was the only EC-135P1 CDS variant in the operator's fleet. Its engines, its displays, and its procedure for restoring FADEC control differed from the EC-135 variant in which the accident pilot was trained. According to the manufacturer's training guidelines, differences training is recommended before a pilot who is trained on another variant flies the EC-135P1 CDS. However, the investigation revealed that the operator provided the accident pilot only about an hour of formal differences training in the EC-135P1 CDS, and there was no evidence that the training adequately covered that variant's FADEC-restore procedures and other issues pertinent to flight safety. The pilot had accumulated about 914 hours of flight experience in EC-135s, with about 45 hours in the EC-135P1 CDS variant. The accident was not the first indication to the operator that pilots who were trained in another variant experienced difficulties with the accident helicopter. According to one other pilot and the accident pilot, they each previously experienced events involving loss of FADEC control in the accident helicopter (in November 2005 and March 2006, respectively) but completed successful landings. The operator determined no mechanical explanation for the events and did not report, and was not required to report, them to its Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) principal operations and maintenance inspectors. The other pilot reported that, at the time of his November 2005 event, he was untrained in the EC-135P1 CDS and was completely unfamiliar with the procedure required to restore FADEC control. That pilot reported that, during his event, he oversped the helicopter's engines and the main rotor, and, as a result, the operator removed the helicopter from service, conducted inspections of the engines and main rotor system, and determined that differences training was needed for the EC-135P1 CDS; however, the operator failed to adequately provide such training. Because the FAA had no knowledge of the previous events with the accident helicopter, it had no indication to suspect that the differences training implemented by the operator was deficient.",
            "probable_cause": "The operator's inadequate training program and the pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter following his inadvertent disabling of the No. 1 and then the No. 2 engine full authority digital engine control system."

Several of the witnesses then saw the helicopter tumble in flight and impact the top of a building. The main rotor blade and empennage impacted the ground a few hundred feet from the impacted building. The owner of the helicopter reported that mechanics performed maintenance to the main rotor assembly and the purpose of the post-maintenance flight was to check the \"track and balance\" of the main rotor blades.Examination of the accident site by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge revealed that the helicopter impacted the top of a two-story building about 2,000 feet southwest of the approach end of runway 34 at BTF.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The airplane was operating in instrument meteorological conditions and, as it approached the destination airport, the pilot requested the RNAV/GPS runway 19 approach and asked for routing directly to ZEDAG, the initial approach fix (IAF). At the time of the pilot's request, the airplane was about 30 miles southeast of the IAF at an altitude of about 5,900 feet mean sea level (msl). The air traffic controller cleared the airplane to fly directly to the IAF followed by the ZEDAG transition and the RNAV/GPS runway 19 approach, stating, \"maintain at or above 2,000\" feet until established on a published segment of the approach. The flight crewmembers repeated the clearance back to the controller as \"maintain 2,000\" feet until established, and they began descending the airplane toward the IAF. About 6 minutes later, the pilot requested to enter the holding pattern while they checked on runway conditions on another radio frequency, and the controller cleared them to hold \"as published.\" At the time of the pilot's request, the airplane was at an altitude of about 2,200 feet msl. As depicted on the published instrument approach procedure, the terminal arrival area (TAA) minimum altitude when approaching the IAF from the southeast (the direction from which the accident flight approached) is 5,400 feet msl, and the published holding pattern at the IAF is 4,300 feet msl due to rising terrain in the area.Therefore, the flight crewmember's acceptance of what they believed to be a clearance to 2,000 feet, their descent to that altitude, and their initiation of a hold at that altitude indicates a lack of awareness of the information contained on the published procedure. Such a lack of awareness is inconsistent with pilot-in-command responsibilities and company procedures that require an instrument approach briefing during the descent and approach phases of flight. If the flight crewmembers had reviewed the published approach procedure and briefed it per the company's descent and approach checklist, they should have noticed that the minimum safe altitude in the TAA southeast of the IAF was 5,400 feet msl and that the minimum altitude for the hold was 4,300 feet msl. Examination of the wreckage and debris path evidence is consistent with the airplane having collided with rising terrain at 2,000 feet msl while flying in a wings-level attitude on the outbound leg of the holding pattern, which the flight crew should have flown at 4,300 feet msl.However, the air traffic controller did not adhere to guidance contained in Federal Aviation Administration Order 7110.65, and his approach clearance to \"maintain at or above 2,000 feet\" msl until established on a published segment of the approach was ambiguous. The controller's approach clearance should have instructed the pilot to \"proceed direct to ZEDAG, enter the TAA at or above 5,400 feet, cleared RNAV runway 19 approach.\" Instead, he instructed the pilot without specifying the segment of the approach that should be flown at 2,000 feet. Further, the controller did not notice the pilot's incorrect readback of the clearance in which he indicated that he intended to \"maintain 2,000 feet\" until established on the approach. Further, he did not appropriately monitor the flight's progress and intervene when the airplane descended to 2,000 feet msl. As a result, the airplane was permitted to descend below the minimum instrument altitudes applicable to the route of flight and enter the holding pattern well below the published minimum holding altitude.Air traffic control (ATC) recorded automation data showed that the airplane's trajectory generated aural and visual minimum safe altitude warnings on the controller's radar display. However, the controller did not issue any terrain warnings or climb instructions to the flight crew. The controller said that he was not consciously aware of any such warnings from his display. These automated warnings should have been sufficient to prompt the controller to evaluate the airplane's position and altitude, provide a safety alert to the pilot in a timely manner, and instruct the pilot to climb to a safe altitude; it could not be determined why the controller was unaware of the warnings. The airplane was equipped with three pieces of navigation equipment that should have provided visual and aural terrain warnings to the flight crewmembers if they had not inhibited the function and if the units were operating properly. Damage precluded testing the equipment or determining the preaccident configuration of the units; however, the flight crew reported no equipment anomalies predeparture.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight crew's failure to maintain terrain clearance, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain in instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's failure to correctly read back and interpret clearance altitudes issued by the air traffic controller, their failure to adhere to minimum altitudes depicted on the published instrument approach chart, and their failure to adhere to company checklists.Also contributing to the accident were the air traffic controller's issuance of an ambiguous clearance to the flight crew, which  resulted in the airplane's premature descent, his failure to address the pilot's incorrect read back of the assigned clearance altitudes, and his failure to monitor the flight and address the altitude violations and issue terrain-based safety alerts."

The friend advised it would be no problem. Later, the pilot called again and stated, \"I can see St. Croix from my house,\" so that he would fly to St. Croix and get the family member himself. The friend became concerned as the weather was \"real bad\" near St. Croix. The pilot departed St. Thomas and received VFR flight following. The controller asked if he was able to go through the weather.  The pilot responded that he did not have any weather where he was, that there was some lightning around him, but that everything seemed \"pretty good.\" The flight was handed off to St. Croix tower. The tower controller asked what his position was, and the pilot responded, \"Roger we are level at (unintelligible) oh boy we're having some prob.\"  This was the last transmission received.

FSS personnel cannot see the runway.  The pilot contacted the FSS by radio and advised he was departing runway 10.  The FSS specialist replied that there was no runway 10, and then provided an airport advisory.  Airport field maintenance personnel monitored the radio conversations between the FSS and the pilot, and observed the airplane depart on runway 08.

The helicopter departed controlled flight after the collision, descended vertically, and was destroyed by impact forces at ground contact. The airplane also departed controlled flight, the ballistic parachute system was deployed, and the airplane landed nose-down in a thicket of low trees and brush. The flight instructor, commercial pilot receiving instruction, and a passenger in the helicopter were fatally injured. The private pilot on board the airplane was not injured, and his passenger sustained a minor injury. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the airplane, which departed Cleveland, Tennessee on a personal flight about 1247. No flight plan was filed for the helicopter, which departed FDK on a pre-rental check-out flight about 1535. Both flights were conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.Preliminary radar and voice communication information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that the accident airplane first contacted the FDK local controller at 1534:10 approximately 10 miles west of the field at an altitude of 3,000 feet. The local controller acknowledged the pilot's transmission and instructed him to report three miles west of the airport for a left downwind to runway 30. The pilot acknowledged and read back the controller's instructions.At the time the accident airplane contacted the local controller, traffic handled by the tower included two helicopters in the traffic pattern, one airplane conducting practice instrument approaches to runway 23, another airplane inbound from the southeast, and also a business jet with its IFR clearance on request.At 1535:02, the controller cleared the accident helicopter for take-off from taxiway alpha, issued the current winds, and the call was acknowledged.At 1536:49, the pilot of the accident airplane reported that he was three miles from the airport on a 45-degree entry for the downwind for landing on runway 30.At 1537:22, the local controller instructed the airplane to report midfield left downwind for runway 30 and said, \"I have three helicopters below ya in the uh traffic pattern\". At 1537:30, the pilot of the airplane acknowledged the request to report midfield downwind and stated he had two of the helicopters in sight. Immediately after that transmission, at 1537:34, the local controller said, \"Alright uh two echo sierra, I have ya in sight runway three zero, maintain your altitude to\u2026until turning base, cleared to land.\"At 1537:49, the pilot of another helicopter in the traffic pattern reported that an airplane and helicopter were both \"down.\"Witnesses on the ground observed the aircraft converge at the same altitude. One witness who observed both aircraft converge indicated that neither aircraft changed altitude as they approached each other and the two subsequently collided.A flight instructor for the operator in another company helicopter followed the accident helicopter in the traffic pattern for landing abeam runway 30. He said his helicopter had just completed the turn onto the crosswind leg of the traffic pattern, when the accident helicopter came into his view. At the same time, the airplane appeared in his field of view as it collided with the helicopter rotor system.The pilot of the accident airplane was not immediately available for interview.The airplane pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued April 31, 2014. He reported 1,080 total hours of flight experience, of which 1,000 hours were in the accident airplane make and model. The flight instructor held commercial pilot and flight instructor certificates with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued April 31, 2014. Examination of his logbook revealed 832 total hours of flight experience, of which 116 hours were in the accident helicopter make and model.The pilot receiving instruction held commercial pilot and flight instructor certificates with ratings for airplane single engine land, multiengine land, rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued April 29, 2013, and he reported 2,850 total hours of flight experience on that date. Excerpts of a pilot logbook revealed 1,538 total hours of helicopter experience. The 1553 weather observation at FDK included scattered clouds at 4,800 feet, 10 miles visibility, and winds from 330 degrees at 16 knots gusting to 21 knots. FDK was located at an elevation of 306 feet and the air traffic control tower was operating at the time of the accident. The published traffic pattern altitude for single-engine and light-twin airplanes was 1,300 feet mean sea level (msl), and 1,800 feet msl for heavy multiengine and jet airplanes. The traffic pattern was a standard left-hand pattern, and there was no published traffic pattern or altitude for helicopters.The helicopter wreckage and its associated debris came to rest in a self-storage complex between two buildings, with parts and debris scattered in and around the complex. All major components were accounted for at the scene. The main wreckage came to rest largely upright, and included the cockpit, cabin area, fuselage, tailboom, engine, transmission, and main and tail rotors. All components were significantly damaged and deformed by impact forces. The \"blue\" main rotor blade was fractured near its root, and the outboard 11 feet of main rotor spar was located 50 feet from the main wreckage with no honeycomb or blade skin afterbody material attached. Control continuity could not be established due to numerous fractures in the system, but all fractures exhibited features consistent with overload. The airplane came to rest nose down, in a dense thicket of brush and low trees, wedged between tree trunks, and held in that position. All major components were accounted for at the scene, except for the right wing flap, aileron, and right landing gear wheel and tire assembly, which were located between the helicopter and airplane sites. Examination of the airplane revealed that the trailing edge of the right wing was impact-damaged. The flap and aileron hinges were significantly damaged and twisted, and the surrounding sheet metal displayed saw-tooth fractures, consistent with overload.",

The Navajo authorities said the winds were southerly at about 30 knots when the aircraft attempted to land. The windsock is not illuminated, and neither the airport nor the CTAF are attended after dark. The pilot said that after touchdown as the aircraft passed the hangar he observed the windsock sticking straight out indicating a tailwind. The pilot said he applied maximum braking, but could not stop prior to over running the departure end of the runway. The aircraft traveled down an embankment, through a ditch, and collided with two steel irrigation posts before coming to rest. FAA inspectors traveled to the accident site and examined both the runway and the aircraft. The touchdown point for the aircraft was identified as about the midpoint of the runway. Tire marks were apparent from that point to where the aircraft left the departure end of the runway and went through a cattle guard. A ditch was associated with the cattle guard.

Several witnesses who observed  takeoff sequence did not notice any abnormalities or abnormal sounds from the aircraft.  One of the witnesses reported that the aircraft made a left turn with a \"normal\" climb out to downwind, and that the engine sounded normal.  The aircraft appeared \"stable\" in the climb and was parallel to the runway approximately 800-1,000 feet above ground level (agl) on the downwind departure.  The aircraft then  entered a left  turn, and just as the turn was completed,  the aircraft \"did one to one and one-half barrel rolls in level flight.\"  Then, while inverted, the aircraft \"tucked under and went straight down.\" Another witness reported that as the aircraft turned, the aircraft \"rolled over and flew inverted for about two seconds,\"  then \"flew nose first into the ground.\"  No radio transmissions or distress calls were received from the accident aircraft.  Logbooks for the aircraft were not recovered.  Prior to the accident, the aircraft had been stored in a hangar that was operated by a aviation museum on airport property, and had not been flown for several months prior to the morning of the accident.  According to a family member and airport personnel, access to the hangar was not controlled, and that the general public could come in to look at the aircraft.  The wreckage debris was severely fragmented and was distributed over an area approximately 110 feet long and 75 feet wide, in a general north-to-south orientation.  Evidence of an extensive ground fire was observed surrounding the debris, and mostly all of the wreckage debris was found within the boundaries of the fire area.  The main portion of the wreckage, which included the engine, propeller, both wings, and fractured fuselage structure was found in a shallow crater in the southern-most area of the scattered debris.  The orientation of the engine and forward section of the fuselage within the crater exhibited evidence that the aircraft impacted the ground in a nose-low, inverted attitude.  The 3-blade propeller exhibited evidence of rotation at the time of impact.  Mostly all of the wreckage within and adjacent to the impact point was consumed by post-impact fire.  Due to the extensive impact and fire damage, flight control continuity could not be established from the cockpit outboard to the wings, however, flight control cables and push/pull rods that were observed appeared to be damaged as a result of impact.  Flight control cables, rods, and bell cranks within the empennage rearward to the horizontal stabilizer, elevators, and rudder did not reveal pre-impact anomalies.  Several pieces of flight control surfaces, flaps, and wing skin material were found north of the impact crater, and appeared to have been \"blown back\" during the impact sequence.

The aircraft was substantially damaged, there were no injuries.  The aircraft was operated as a non-military Public Aircraft in Restricted Airspace.According to the operator, the aircraft had departed from KXMR at 0736 EDT for a routine patrol in the warning areas east of the airport. The aircraft conducted the launch and patrol without incident. The aircraft departed the patrol area at approximately 1142 EDT for return to KXMR. During the initial approach under VFR conditions, the aircraft conducted a go-around after first touching down. During the first landing attempt, the Sensor Operator (SO) called for a go-around when he noticed that the aircraft was slowing below the recommended landing speed based on the weight of the aircraft (computed reference speed was 102 knots) and that the aircraft was floating. The main landing gear contacted the runway, rebounding the aircraft back into the air. The aircraft remained airborne for the go-around procedure. Flight instrumentation in the GCS recorded a G-Load of +3.8 with the hard landing annunciator illuminating momentarily. Flight was re-established in the traffic pattern for a second landing procedure. Winds were reported from the control tower at 140 degrees at 11 knots with no gusts reported. The approach was made to Runway 13. Upon the second landing attempt to Runway 13, the control tower once again reported winds from 140 degrees at 11 knots. No gusts were reported by the control tower. As the aircraft approached its landing area, a flare to land was conducted resulting in the aircraft maintaining an attitude of approximately 20 feet above the runway (based on laser altimeter information) as power was reduced. The indicated airspeed dropped to approximately 89 knots as the landing gear came into contact with the runway nose wheel first. As the aircraft bounced on the nose wheel, the SO called for a go-around. The PIC stated that the aircraft was already on the ground and did not initiate a go-around at that time. The nose wheel bounced a second time with the height of the rebound being greater than the first. Upon the third contact of the nose wheel with the runway, the nose wheel tire failed and the aircraft rebounded with a higher pitch angle resulting in a high angle of attack warning. During the fourth contact with the runway, the landing gear sheared. The aircraft then fell onto its EO/IR payload (located under the nose portion of the fuselage) and veered off of the runway to Its left. The aircraft came to rest on its nose approximately 30 feet to the left side of the runway. The left winglet was in contact with the sod and its right main landing gear was holding up the right side of the aircraft. The G-Load recorded in the GCS during the accident landing sequence was +5.0. During both approaches and landings the LRE PIC utilized the daytime airframe camera for the approach and landing with the SO utilizing the daytime EO/IR system. The aircraft gross weight and center of gravity were within the limits as stated in the Operators Manual with no indication of CG related issue being present. The Ground Control Station(GCS) was configured in a standard setting that was appropriate for the mission being flown. An analysis was completed and it was determined by CBP UAS engineers that the GCS was working properly and did not contribute the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "an improper flare leading to a nose-wheel first touchdown, which resulted in a pilot induced oscillation (PIO).

According to several witnesses, they heard an increase in engine rpm consistent with the pilot adding power to perform a go-around. Several witnesses reported hearing a subsequent loss of engine power. The nose of the airplane rose and then dropped. The airplane was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain beyond the departure end of the runway. The damage to the airplane and the resultant ground scars were consistent with the airplane being in a stalled condition at the time of the accident. An examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. An examination of the fuel system revealed that the fuel selector was stiff and difficult to rotate. Further examination revealed that the O-rings on the fuel selector valve\u2019s internal spindle were swollen past the plane of the shaft of the spindle, preventing easy rotation. The pilot was aware of the fuel selector valve anomaly; however, a service bulletin addressing the problem with the fuel selector O-rings had not yet been complied with. The fuel blighting evidence at the accident site and the quantity of fuel found in the right fuel tank suggest that the right wing contained fuel at the time of impact. Based on the circumstances of the accident, it is most likely that the engine lost power due to fuel starvation during the go-around with the fuel selector valve positioned to the left tank, and the pilot became distracted when he tried to switch fuel tanks and lost control of the airplane.Toxicological testing revealed the presence of antidepressant and cardiac medications in the pilot\u2019s system. The blood level of the antidepressant medication was higher than usual therapeutic levels, indicating a high dose and prolonged use. The antidepressant medication in the pilot\u2019s system comes with the warning that it may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. In addition, depression is associated with significant cognitive degradation. A review of the pilot\u2019s medical records revealed an extensive history of psychiatric and cardiac issues and subsequent difficulties obtaining a medical certificate for flight. Before the pilot\u2019s most recent medical certification exam, he provided the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical examiner with documentation indicating that he was no longer taking antidepressants. Required standardized neuropsychological testing placed the pilot at average, below average, or mildly impaired when compared with other (somewhat younger) pilots. Based on the levels of antidepressant medication in the pilot\u2019s system, the pilot likely knowingly misreported his medication use to the FAA when he applied for his medical certificate. The pilot\u2019s underlying depression, personality disorder, cognitive issues, and medication use likely contributed to his unwillingness to address the airplane\u2019s fuel selector valve problem. In addition, these conditions would have adversely affected the pilot\u2019s ability to maintain control of the airplane in an emergency.",

The engine hesitated, and he applied more right rudder and full right brake with no results. He aborted the takeoff and applied both brakes to slow the airplane. The airplane exited the left side of the runway and collided with a runway sign; the left main landing gear collapsed, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe.

The pilot attempted to extend the landing gear manually, again with no result. The pilot then decided to fly the airplane to the airport in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which has a control tower, and have the tower controllers visually verify that the landing gear was down. The tower controller at Santa Fe advised the pilot that the airplane's nose landing gear was not extended and the nose gear doors were closed. After several more unsuccessful attempts to troubleshoot the problem, the pilot returned to Los Alamos and landed the airplane with the nose gear retracted, resulting in substantial damage. The airplane was examined and the landing gear was operated by a FAA inspector. During the first gear extension the nose landing gear unlocked, but the nose landing gear doors did not open. A mechanic pushed lightly on the gear doors and they came open, and the nose landing gear came down and locked. Subsequent cycles of the landing gear could not duplicate the problem.",

During the landing, the left main gear collapsed and the left wing and nose of the aircraft dug into the soft soil, sustaining substantial damage. A teardown inspection of the engine revealed fretting wear scars on the crankcase backbone between the number two and three main bearing supports, and the number one, two, and three camshaft journal supports. The number one, two, three, four, and five main crankshaft main bearing supports exhibited fretting wear scars, and the number two and three supports exhibited mechanical damage from bearing shift and rotation.  Additionally, the number two intermediate crankshaft main bearings had extruded from their crankshaft positions in the left and right case halves.  An unapproved red sealant had been applied to the crankcase backbone. The above signatures are all consistent with an engine crankcase assembly that had lost its through-bolt torque.  The crankshaft was fractured through at the number four short cheek between the number two main bearing journal and the number three connecting rod journal. A metallurgical examination of the fracture surface revealed crack arrest marks, which were indicative of a fatigue fracture which emanated from the surface of the number two main bearing journal.

Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact malfunctions. It was noted that while witnesses reported they observed the airplane's landing gear and flaps extended during the beginning of the accident sequence, postaccident observations were consistent with the landing gear and flaps in the retracted position. The pilot had a history consistent with alcohol and prescription drug dependence, and had at least once previously failed rehabilitation treatment. He had been experiencing worsening back pain, and had undergone surgery about 6 weeks prior to the accident, with continuing pain after the surgery. He had been using prescription narcotic medications from multiple different providers for over a year prior to the accident, most recently filling a large prescription for prescription narcotic medications 3 days prior to the accident. Postmortem toxicology testing was consistent with recent use of a prescription anti-depressant, also used to treat nicotine dependence that can increase the likelihood of seizure activity, though that risk remains low. Toxicology testing also was consistent with the relatively recent use of a prescription narcotic medication, but the lack of such medication in the pilot's blood suggests the possibility that the pilot may have been experiencing the effects of opiate withdrawal, which can include agitation, anxiety, nausea, and abdominal cramping, among other symptoms. The pilot may also have been distracted by back pain.

The approach was backed up by an instrument landing system and was stable at 1000 feet above touchdown. During the final approach the crew noted an increasing tailwind. As the first officer (FO) entered the flare, the \u201cretard\u201d automatic callout sounded; this automatic call-out is designed to remind the pilot to move the thrust levers to idle. Despite the callout, the thrust levers remained at climb and the autothrust system commanded increased engine power in an attempt to recover airspeed. The airplane touched down, but then bounced as a result of excess thrust and the position of the thrust levers forward of idle, which prevented deployment of the spoilers. The FO then retarded the thrust levers, which allowed spoiler deployment, and the airplane touched down firmly. During the second touchdown, the FO began pitching the airplane nose up to about 12.5 degrees, which is greater than the specified maximum pitch angle and which resulted in the tailstrike. The captain attempted to add nose-down pitch to prevent the tailstrike but was too late. The aircraft experienced heavy abrasions, dents, and perforations of the skin; the aft galley drain mast and two aircraft antennas were broken; the auxiliary power unit air intake sustained damage and the rear pressure bulkhead was buckled and cracked.",

While setting up for a 45-degree entry into the airport traffic pattern, the pilot of the Pitts heard a radio transmission from another airport and then announced his position on the entry to the airport traffic pattern. While on a downwind leg of the airport traffic pattern, the pilot of the Pitts subsequently heard another radio transmission that another airplane was approaching THA and would be following the Pitts. He then heard a faint radio transmission that there was a red biplane on the runway, but no airport was associated with the transmission. He looked for a red biplane and did not see any airplanes on runway 36. The pilot of the Pitts continued his approach and again did not see any airplanes while on final approach.

The pilot reported that, shortly after, a \u201cvibration\u201d began at an unknown airspeed and that it then increased to a heavy flutter event. The pilot pitched the airplane upward and reduced the airspeed. As the airspeed decreased below 90 KIAS, the vibration stopped, and the pilot landed uneventfully. Postaccident examination of the control horn assembly revealed fractures at the forward and aft trim tab control horn brackets and the rod end clevis. According to the airplane manufacturer\u2019s assembly manual, the aft trim tab control horn was supposed to be attached to the lower skin with four rivets. However, examination revealed that only three of the four rivets were installed; no evidence of a through hole for the fourth rivet was found. The lack of the fourth rivet allowed the aft bracket to flex, and the relative movement between the bracket and the trim tab skin during flight resulted in fretting damage. Examination of the aft bracket\u2019s fracture surface revealed features consistent with an overstress separation.The published never-exceed speed for the airplane was 240 knots true airspeed (KTAS). The airspeed was calculated to be 266 KTAS at the time of the event. The airplane's excessive speed coupled with the incorrect installation of the trim tab control horn likely initiated the flutter in the left elevator trim tab during the start of the air race. The flutter subsequently produced dynamic loads in the trim tab control system that exceeded the material strength of the system components and led to the fracture of the forward and aft trim tab control horn brackets and the rod end clevis before the airplane was slowed sufficiently to stop the flutter.

They heard the helicopter crash, saw smoke, and ran to the crash site. One main rotor blade was found approximately 780 feet from the wreckage. The other main rotor blade was found approximately 975 feet from the wreckage in the opposite direction. Both blades had separated from the main rotor hub at their coning hinges. All components of the helicopter were accounted for with the exception of portions of both coning bolts. The investigation was unable to locate the object observed falling from the helicopter or determine what it was. Examination of the rotor head components, including the recovered portions of the coning bolts, revealed fracture features consistent with overload failure and mechanical damage indicative of mast bumping (contact between the main rotor blades and the mast). The main rotor blade pitch links and attaching hardware displayed compression buckling and bending overload features consistent with an out-of-control main rotor that had diverged from its normal plane of rotation. The helicopter manufacturer reported that the damage signatures were consistent with both low-G mast bumping and low rotor rpm rotor stall. Low-G mast bumping is a phenomenon specific to two-bladed teetering rotor systems in which the rotor disc becomes unloaded, typically due to a cyclic pushover. Low rotor rpm rotor stall is a different phenomenon in which the main rotor blades experience an aerodynamic stall due to low rotor rpm caused either by the pilot raising the collective too much or by a loss of engine power followed by the pilot lowering the collective too slowly. Rotor blade stall can lead to mast bumping. The pilot\u2019s control inputs leading up to the event are unknown, and, therefore, the reason for the main rotor divergence could not be determined.",

The pilot and a passenger were on a local flight and did not return.  The wreckage was located strewn over an area of grassy hills.  The wings and empennage sections were found separate from the main fuselage.  The owner of the airplane had flown with the pilot just prior to the accident flight and reported that the pilot had been doing aileron rolls.  The airplane had flown about 4 hours since its annual inspection.  Prior to that time, the airplane was damaged during a hard landing and sat, unrepaired, for 2 years.  Post accident examination of the airframe revealed extensive corrosion through the wing walk areas and wing spar center section, with corrosion affecting at least 20 rivets that secure the web to the upper spar cap.  A Safety Board metallurgist determined that the area of the wing spar center section corrosion could not have been detected through current inspection methods and procedures.  The critical buckling stress on the upper spar cap was several times as high as the estimated stress carried by the upper spar cap in straight and level flight, which indicates the failure most likely occurred in a steep turn or other high load maneuver.  The collapse of the spar could only occur when enough rivets had corroded to allow the disconnected part of the spar cap to reach its critical buckling strength.  Ercoupe Service Bulletin (SB) No. 18 was issued for the reinforcement of the center section belly skin as a direct result of cracks occurring in the center section belly skin at the rearmost rivet attachment in the center section belly skin outer stiffeners.  Service Bulletin 31 was issued in July 2000, and required inspection within the next 5 hours of operation or at the next 100-hour or annual inspection, whichever occurred first.  The SB was intended to detect corrosion and prescribed certain visual methods of inspection.  AD 2002-26-02 was intended to detect and correct corrosion in the wing center section, which could result in failure of the wing center section structure during flight.  The AD contained three methods of accomplishing the inspection: install inspection openings; use a scope and a light source; or remove outer wing panels to gain visual access to the wing walkway box structure.   AD 2003-21-01 was issued in response to additional reports of corrosion on airplanes found during compliance with AD 94-18-04 R1.  The actions of the AD were intended to prevent wing damage caused by a corroded wing outer panel structural component.

It also called for repetitive inspections every 12 months.  Comparison of the inspection requirements in the Service Bulletins and AD's to the area where the corrosion was present in the accident aircraft revealed that none of the inspection methods would likely have found the corrosion.

The accident occurred during dark night, visual meteorological conditions, about 13 minutes into the night cross-country flight. No lighted roads or round structures were present in the area to provide ground reference to terrain. 1% of the moons disk was illuminated. Over the last 6 minutes of the flight, recorded radar data indicated the airplane's average groundspeed was 100 knots and its average rate of climb was 406 fpm; an average rate of climb of 600 fpm was required to clear terrain along the flight path. An examination of the accident site indicated that the airplane impacted rapidly rising terrain in a near level flight attitude before descending and coming to rest in a rock outcropping. The resultant high-energy impact forces, coupled with the extensive thermal damage, destroyed the airplane. A postaccident examination of the airframe's structure and engine failed to reveal any preimpact failures or malfunctions. The airplane was equipped with a Garmin G1000 Integrated Cockpit System, which incorporates a multifunction color display that is capable of displaying terrain elevation information when selected to the Terrain Proximity page. Due to the extensive impact and thermal damage that the component had sustained, it was not possible to determine if the pilot was using the display to receive topographic data during the airplane's ascent. Records indicate that the pilot had received G1000 training. The Pilot's Guide for the G1000 states: \"CAUTION: Use of Terrain Proximity information for primary terrain avoidance is prohibited. The Terrain Proximity Map is intended only to enhance situational awareness. It is the pilot's responsibility to provide terrain avoidance at all times.\" The flight was departing on a VFR flight plan and was receiving VFR flight following services from the Las Vegas Terminal Radar Approach Control facility.  Air traffic control radar data revealed that the airplane was continuously visible to the controller on his radar display from the departure airport until impact with mountainous terrain. The airplane's course remained constant as he approached and impacted the mountain during the dark nighttime flight. The air traffic controller did not issue a terrain-related safety alert, as required by a Federal Aviation Administration order, because he did not observe a conflict with terrain.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate terrain clearance/altitude during climb to cruise. Contributing to the accident were rising mountainous terrain, the dark nighttime lighting condition, the pilot's loss of situational awareness, and the Federal Aviation Administration controller's failure to issue a terrain-related safety alert."

The airplane impacted terrain 1/3-mile from the approach end of runway 28, and north of its extended centerline.  A witness, located in the airport's administration building, made the following statement regarding his observations:  \"I saw the aircraft in and out of the clouds in a close base for [runway] 28.  I then saw the aircraft emerge from a cloud in a base to final turn [and] it appeared to be approximately 300-400 feet above the ground.  The left wing was down nearly 90 degrees.  The aircraft appeared north of the [runway 28] centerline.  The aircraft pitched nose down approximately 30-40 degrees and appeared to do a 1/2 cartwheel on the ground before exploding.\"  ATC controllers had cleared the airplane to perform a GPS-A (circling) approach.  The published weather minimums for category C and D airplanes at the 5,900-foot mean sea level airport was 3 miles visibility, and the minimum descent altitude was 8,200 feet mean sea level (msl).  Airport weather observers noted that when the accident occurred, the visibility was between 1 1/2 and 5 miles.  Scattered clouds existed at 1,200 feet above ground level (7,100 feet msl), a broken ceiling existed at 1,500 feet agl (7,400 feet msl) and an overcast condition existed at 2,400 feet agl (8,300 feet msl).  During the approach, the first officer acknowledged to the controller that he had received the airport's weather.  The airplane overflew the airport in a southerly direction, turned east, and entered a left downwind pattern toward runway 28.  A 20- to 30-knot gusty surface wind existed from 220 degrees, and the pilot inadequately compensated for the wind during his base leg-to-final approach turning maneuver.  The airplane was equipped with Digital Electronic Engine Controls (DEEC) that recorded specific data bits relating to, for example, engine speed, power lever position and time.  During the last 4 seconds of recorded data (flight), both of the power levers were positioned from a mid range point to apply takeoff power, and the engines responded accordingly.  No evidence was found of any preimpact mechanical malfunction.

A metallurgical examination revealed that the bolt failed in reverse bending fatigue, which is associated with the bolt having insufficient clamping pressure (looseness). The airplane\u2019s last required inspection was about 70 flight hours and 40 gear cycles before the nose gear collapsing, and the nose gear downlock system rigging should have been inspected at that time.

The dual student stated that the right engine loss of power occurred at about 2,000 feet. The flight instructor took control of the airplane and turned back toward the airport. The right engine had a short power recovery and then failed completely. While maintaining VySE, 88 knots, the airplane was descending about 200 feet per minute.

He assisted the flight instructor with the \"Landing with an inoperative engine\" checklist and at this time they feathered the right propeller. The field they picked looked to be flat with grass. After landing they found the braking was not effective on the very wet grass. At the end of the field there was a 12 feet wide and 4 feet deep canal that sloped down.

After the helicopter landed at the East 34th Street Heliport (6N5), the pilot did not shut down the engine while the passengers boarded. The pilot had initially anticipated taking two passengers on the flight, but the two passengers brought two additional adults with them who also boarded the helicopter. The pilot did not conduct a safety briefing or mention life vests available on board the helicopter, complete performance planning, or perform weight-and-balance calculations before takeoff. (The heliport personnel did not conduct a safety briefing and were not required to do so.)The helicopter departed 6N5 in a rearward hover and transitioned over the shoreline from an in-ground-effect condition to an out-of-ground-effect (OGE) condition while climbing to about 60 feet above the water. As the pilot completed a pedal turn into the wind, the helicopter yawed, and what was likely the low rotor rpm audio warning sounded. The pilot believed that he heard an engine-out warning and responded by turning back toward 6N5, which oriented the tail into an adverse (tail) wind condition. He then confirmed normal engine operation by the N1 gas tachometer and concluded that the initial yaw was \u201cweathervaning\u201d as opposed to an engine malfunction. After the pilot increased collective pitch, the helicopter entered an uncommanded right yaw that accelerated into a spin around the main rotor mast that could not be corrected by application of full left pedal. At this point, the pilot believed that the helicopter had tail rotor drive failure or encountered a loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE). Witnesses described the helicopter as descending in an uncontrolled spin before it contacted the water, where it then rolled inverted and sank. The pilot and front-seat passenger, who were not injured, attempted to help the aft-seat passengers evacuate as the helicopter filled with water and sank. One passenger drowned at the scene, and two passengers later died in a hospital from complications of near drowning. (Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 830.2 defines fatal injury as \u201cany injury which results in death within 30 days of the accident.\u201d Because one passenger\u2019s death occurred 33 days after the accident, she is listed as a \u201cserious injury\u201d in this report.) The helicopter was difficult to exit because it was inverted in the water.Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the engine, drive train, main rotor, tail rotor, or structure of the helicopter. Additionally, the main and tail rotors showed indications of rotation at the time of water impact. The investigation determined that the helicopter was loaded to an overweight condition, likely because the pilot did not anticipate having two additional passengers onboard the helicopter and because he did not perform weight-and-balance calculations. The front-seat passenger stated in a postaccident interview that the pilot did not ask for anyone\u2019s weight or perform any calculations before takeoff. The passenger weights that the pilot provided investigators following the accident were significantly less than the weights provided by medical personnel and the surviving passenger. The calculated empty weight of the helicopter at its most recent weight-and-balance check on October 21, 2008, was 1,914.52 pounds, and the estimated empty weight postaccident, including residual water, was estimated to be 2,146.8 pounds. Therefore, investigators determined that the estimated gross weight of the helicopter at takeoff was likely between 3,228 pounds and 3,461.2 pounds. The manufacturer\u2019s maximum allowable gross weight at takeoff was 3,200 pounds.Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular (AC) 90-95, \u201cUnanticipated Right Yaw in Helicopters,\u201d issued in February 1995, described LTE as a critical, low speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that could result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate that does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, could result in the loss of aircraft control. The AC also stated, \u201cLTE is not related to a maintenance malfunction and may occur in varying degrees in all single main rotor helicopters at airspeeds less than 30 knots\u2026Any maneuver which requires the pilot to operate in a high-power, low-airspeed environment with a left crosswind or tailwind creates an environment where unanticipated right yaw may occur.\u201d When operating at airspeeds below effective translational lift, pilots should avoid OGE hover and high power demand situations, such as low-speed downwind turns. Contributing factors for LTE included high gross weight, low indicated airspeed, and right downwind turns. Thus, it is likely that the helicopter experienced LTE shortly after takeoff because all of these factors were present at the time of the accident. Due to the pilot\u2019s ineffective actions and his failure to anticipate and correct for these conditions, he was unable to recover.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to anticipate and correct for conditions (high gross weight, low indicated airspeed, and a right downwind turn) conducive to loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), which resulted in LTE and an uncontrolled spin.

The airplane continued to descend below the tree line and a loud \"crash\" was heard. The passenger recalled that the engine sounded \"like a choke was pulled on the engine, as if you were restricting air\". The pilot then pulled the carburetor heat and tried to lean the mixtures. The engine did not regain full power, and the pilot made an emergency landing in field, and cart wheeled numerous times.  Examination of the accident site revealed, the airplane came to rest in a field nine miles north of the Wilkes County Airport. Examination of the airplane revealed that both wing assemblies were buckled, and outboard sections of the wings were curled upwards. The ailerons and flaps were still connected to the wing assemblies. Fuel was observed in the right and left wing tank when the fuel caps were opened. Examination of the engine revealed valve train movement to the accessory pulley and on all valve assemblies. Compression was attained on all cylinders and spark was produced from the ignition leads. Fuel was found in the supply hose and in the carburetor fuel bowl. Examination of the engine did not reveal any mechanical or flight control anomalies. Review of the North Wilkesboro, North Carolina weather revealed that flight conditions were favorable for carburetor icing. ",

When the main landing gear touched down, a gust of wind lifted the airplane off the runway. The airplane touched down again and then bounced too high to continue the landing. The pilot subsequently initiated a go-around; the airplane was at full power with an airspeed of less than 43 knots. He did not raise the flaps because he was afraid the airplane would descend. The airplane started a slow descent, and the stall warning horn sounded. The airplane subsequently struck a small tree and then the ground, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and wings. The wind at the airport was from 190 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 23 knots at the time of the accident.

Just prior to a loss of radar/radio contact with air traffic control, the pilot was initiating a climb to a higher altitude from which he previously descended where he reported light rime icing.  He reported that he wanted to get between what he described as layers.  Weather data and information indicated that the airplane encountered occasional light rime or mixed icing after the pilot reported light rime icing and later encountered a patch of supercooled large droplets and accumulated moderate to severe icing before its uncontrolled descent.  An AIRMET for occasional moderate rime or mixed icing was issued for an area that included the accident route of flight.The pilot logged a total actual instrument time 39.7 hours since he received his instrument rating in 1982.  He logged 2.7 hours of instrument time in the last 90 days and 1.9 hours in the last 30 days before the accident.  The airplane was not equipped with a wing deice system and did not have a current pitot static system check.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any anomalies which would have precluded normal operation.",

The continued flight in known icing conditions and the flight to an alternate destination not performed by the pilot were additional causes.  A contributing factor was the pilot's lack of qualification as an air carrier."
