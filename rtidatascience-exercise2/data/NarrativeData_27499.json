The public use flight was conducted in order to survey a tollway.  According to the pilot, the helicopter began, \"a sudden right yaw with possibly a raising of the tail.  The aircraft then yawed left, possibly in response to pedal input ... Then started what seemed to be a slower right rotation.\"  The helicopter continued to rotate to the right, descended, and impacted the structure of an overhead road sign, a privacy/guard fence and then came to rest on the ground adjacent to the fence.  The reported winds in the vicinity of the accident site were 290 degrees at 15 knots.  Radar track data showed that the helicopter traveled in a northwesterly direction parallel to an interstate highway, passed a toll plaza, and then began a left turn.  The radar data showed that during the left turn, the wind direction relative to the aircraft ground track entered the region defined in the Federal Aviation Administration \"Rotorcraft Flying Handbook\" (FAA-H-8083-21), as being conducive to weathercock instability.  During this same period, the helicopter's calibrated airspeed was between 4 and 20 knots.  FAA-H-8083-21 states that, \"In this region, the helicopter attempts to weathervane its nose into the relative wind. Unless a resisting pedal input is made, the helicopter starts a slow, uncommanded turn either to the right or left depending upon the wind direction. If the pilot allows a right yaw rate to develop and the tail of the helicopter moves into this region, the yaw rate can accelerate rapidly.\"  FAA-H-8083-21 also states that, \"Unanticipated yaw is the occurrence of an uncommanded yaw rate that does not subside of its own accord and, which, if not corrected, can result in the loss of helicopter control. This uncommanded yaw rate is referred to as loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) and occurs to the right in helicopters with a counter-clockwise rotating main rotor.\"  No anomalies were found with respect to the helicopter.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper in-flight decision while maneuvering which resulted in a tailwind during low airspeed helicopter flight and subsequent loss of tail rotor effectiveness.  The struck sign and fence were factors in the accident."

The approach was backed up by an ILS and was stable at 500 feet above touchdown.  The initial touchdown was firm and main landing gear rebounded, possibly bouncing slightly off the runway.  Control column input and possibly momentum from the touchdown resulted in a rapid pitch down and hard nose gear impact with the runway.  Wing spoilers likely did not deploy due to the main gear bounce and/or throttle position.  Following the nose gear impact, the airplane pitched up as expected and the column was held in a slightly forward position.  Airspeed rapidly decayed, and engine power began to increase as the airplane pitch reversed to a downward motion for a second time.  One of the crew, likely the FO, called \u201cflare flare\u201d and the column recorded a rapid nose up input, followed by a rapid nose down input, and the nose gear again struck the runway very hard, likely causing the majority of the damage at that point.  Following the second nose gear impact, column inputs stabilized at a slightly nose up command, power was set on all three engines, and the go-around was successfully executed.  A slight lag in the power increase on engine number 3 may have contributed to the nose down motion leading to the second nose gear impact, although the large forward (airplane nose down) column movement appears to be a much more significant contributor.  It is unclear why the engine was slower to increase.  Throttle lever angle was not recorded, but the engine operated as expected for all other phases of the flight, including after the impact, therefore it is possible the pilot did not advance the number 3 throttle concurrently with the others.The captain\u2019s flight and duty schedule complied with Federal Aviation regulations, but he experienced a demanding 10-day trip schedule prior to the incident involving multiple time zone crossings and several long duty periods, and reported difficulties sleeping prior to the accident leg.  The captain was likely further affected by a digestive system upset during the accident flight.  It is likely that the captain\u2019s performance was degraded by fatigue and some degree of physical discomfort brought on by a short-term illness. The captain had recently completed upgrade training to DC-10, having previously been flying as an MD-11 first officer.  The training program was fragmented over approximately ten months, and while in accordance with FAA regulations, may have adversely affected his consolidation of skills and experience.",

At that time, there was no one at the FBO who could provide him information on mountain flying, and no posted information was available. She later heard that the pilot planned to take off under visual flight rules and fly through the mountains along the interstate. Radar data showed that the airplane took off to the west, turned south, and then climbed to about 10,400 ft mean sea level (msl). Once the airplane reached the interstate, it turned west toward the mountains and followed the interstate. About 25 minutes after taking off, when the airplane was at 10,200 ft msl, radar contact with the airplane was lost. Witnesses near the accident site were consistent with their accounts, which indicated that the airplane was flying between about 11,000 and 11,500 ft msl (200 to 300 ft above the ground) with the engine producing power. The airplane was in a nose-high attitude when it started turning left away from rising terrain. The airplane then turned about 180 degrees, rolled over to the left, and entered a steep dive before impacting trees and terrain. One of the witnesses indicated that, before the left turn, the airplane\u2019s path seemed pretty flat with little gain in altitude. A postimpact fire ensued, which consumed most of the airplane.A postaccident examination confirmed flight control continuity and revealed no preimpact anomalies with the engine or airplane systems that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot did not use any weather or flight planning services. No evidence was found that the pilot had obtained training in mountain flying. A weather model determined that, at the time of the accident, the density altitude was about 12,850 ft, which would have reduced the airplane's climb rate by more than 90 percent. It is likely that, as the pilot attempted to cross over the mountainous terrain, he raised the airplane's nose such that the airplane was beyond its critical angle-of-attack, which, combined with the airplane's decreased climb performance, led to an aerodynamic stall and loss of control. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s inability to maintain a climb while maneuvering the airplane in high-density altitude conditions that degraded the airplane\u2019s climb performance and his exceedance of the airplane\u2019s critical angle-of-attack, which led to an aerodynamic stall and loss of control. Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s inadequate preflight planning and his decision to fly into mountainous terrain."

The private pilot received minor injuries, and the passenger was uninjured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR flight plan was filed for the flight, conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, destined for the Burlington National Airport (BTV), Burlington, Vermont.According to the pilot, after arriving at POU from Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE), Allentown, Pennsylvania, he purchased 15 gallons of fuel and then sumped the tanks in preparation for the next leg of their flight to BTV.After starting the engine he taxied out, did his engine runup, checked the magnetos, and cycled the propeller. Then during the takeoff from runway 24, he noticed a vibration and unusual noise as he rotated. He believed that it may have been from the wheels and applied the brakes to stop the wheels from rotating and retracted the landing gear but, the vibration continued. He was however unable to continue climbing, as the engine suddenly incurred a partial loss of power.He checked that the propeller, throttle, and mixture, was full forward but the airplane still would not climb. With the airspeed being low, he knew that he could not make it back to the airport without stalling the airplane.There were \"trees everywhere\" and a set of power lines directly ahead of him. He then pulled back on the control wheel, was able to clear the power lines, and then \"forced the nose down\" to prevent the airplane from stalling, and landed gear up about 300 feet from the power lines.According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and pilot records, the pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, airplane single engine sea, and instrument airplane. His most recent application for a FAA third-class medical certificate was dated August 5, 2014. The pilot reported that he had accrued approximately 8,954 total hours of flight experience, of which 6,311 hours were in the accident airplane make and model.According to FAA and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 1979. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on December 17, 2014. At the time of the inspection, the airplane had accrued 6,796.6 total hours of operation.",

The initial takeoff roll was normal with the glider becoming airborne prior to the tow plane.  The glider pilot applied forward stick pressure to remain in ground effect and in proper position relative to the tow plane, which was still accelerating on its takeoff roll.  After the tow plane became airborne the glider began to climb above proper tow position.

A forced landing was made in a corn field, across the corn rows.  The airplane nosed over and caught fire.  Examination of the engine revealed that both left cylinders had no compression, and the cylinder head bolts were found with zero torque.  The lower forward hold down bolt was found backed out 1/8 inch.  After removing the cylinder head and barrels for both left cylinders, evidence of severe combustion gas blow by was found on both barrels and both heads.  Metal was melted out of the heads at the bottom forward and bottom aft hold down bolt areas.  The loose cylinder head barrels would have resulted in a significant loss of engine power.  Toxicology testing revealed that the pilot had recently used two different impairing medications, but it is unclear whether the medication use was relevant to the accident sequence. ",

He noted that the landing gear and flaps were partially down and that he saw the pilot wave his hand out his window. Shortly after, the airplane turned west, and the landing gear began to retract. The friend returned to his previous activities, and, within seconds, he heard a \u201cwhump\u201d followed by silence. He moved to a better vantage point and observed smoke in the direction of his last observation of the airplane. A pilot-rated witness at the local airport reported that he was familiar with the surrounding area and noticed that the airplane was flying low and that it then started flying up a valley between two ridgelines, disappeared from his sight behind the nearest one, and, about 20 seconds later, he saw smoke. The airplane collided with trees, and it was destroyed in a postcrash fire. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failure that would have precluded normal operation. The autopsy found no evidence of a recent or acute coronary event or the presence of medications that would have affected the pilot\u2019s performance. Further, the witness statements did not suggest acute incapacitation or sudden severe impairment, and evidence suggests the pilot was manipulating the controls just before impact.

The airplane was a PZL-Mielec M-18T that had been modified with a Lycoming T53 turbine engine and propeller assembly from an Army OV-1 Mohawk aircraft.  The pilot reported that the flight was uneventful until he was descending through 4,500 feet mean sea level (msl) to enter the right downwind for runway 30.  As he reached 4,000 feet msl he reapplied power, but there was no increase in thrust and the N2 (propeller) warning light illuminated, indicating an overspeed condition.  He immediately reduced power and brought the propeller to high pitch to try regain control of the propeller.  When he reapplied power, the N2 overspeed light illuminated again.  It became obvious to him that he would not make the runway so he executed a forced landing to a rolling wheat field.  He reported that the \"glidepath was steep and the three point landing was firm with a slight drift to the right from a northerly wind gust\" resulting in damage to the right wing spar.  The propeller control assembly, a Mohawk control, part number 557996, serial number SE 15579, was bench tested.  The technician reported that when he started to run the test with the unit at 600 - 700 rpm, the unit went to either high or low pitch with high torque.  He reported there was an \"extreme pressure build-up which erupted out the rear-seal flange.\"  The teardown of the propeller control assembly revealed contamination of the 10 pressure relief valve filter disks, the bottom of the pressure sump, the main pump intake filter, and the scavenge pump filter.  There were no other anomalies found in the propeller control assembly.  The overhaul technician reported, \"With the scavenge pump plugged, you were not moving any oil to the pressurized pump and, therefore, you had no oil to control because that's where your oil is coming from to control pitch change.  So it would be equivalent to a loss of control in terms of what's going to happen.\"  He further stated, \"With no oil pressure you get pitch lock. ... Without the oil to control it from the pressurized sump, you're going to get an over-speed and it'll pitch lock.\"  The airplane operator reported that he used 20-weight (20W) or 30-weight (30W), non-detergent automotive engine oil in the propeller control assembly.  The Army maintenance manual (Technical Manual (TM) 55-1510-217-23) stated that the propeller control unit shall be serviced with hydraulic fluid, Spec MIL-H-5606.  The pilot reported that 30W, non-detergent automotive engine oil was used in the propeller control assembly.  After one flight, the propeller control assembly needed servicing and the pilot added 4 ounces of 50W detergent oil instead of a non-detergent oil.  He reported that the Federal Aviation Administration had not approved the use of automotive engine oil in the propeller control assembly instead of the required hydraulic fluid.  FAR 43.13 states, \"Each person performing maintenance, alteration, or preventive maintenance on an aircraft, engine, propeller, or appliance shall use the methods, techniques, and practices prescribed in the current manufacturer's maintenance manual or instructions for Continued Airworthiness prepared by its manufacturer, or other methods, techniques, and practices acceptable to the Administrator.\"  The airplane had flown 19 hours since the last 100 hour maintenance inspection.

Hotel management did not perform a background competency check prior to utilizing the pilot's services.  The pilot selected the departure site and did not launch pibals to determine the speed and direction of the winds aloft.  The flight commenced from a location about 6 nm north-northeast of the FAA controlled Deer Valley Airport, and the airport's wind was from the northeast.  After takeoff, the balloon drifted into the airport's Class D airspace and traffic pattern. The pilot had no communication with the control tower.  As the balloon drifted through the airspace, the pilot commenced descending at a high rate and impacted hard in an open field about 1 mile west of the airport.  The balloon bounced several times and the pilot failed to turn off the pilot lights or rip open the envelope's deflation panel.

The pilot changed course slightly to fly close to or over the mountains. The airplane subsequently experienced an in-flight breakup. All of the airplane's structural components and flight control surfaces were located at the main impact site. There was no evidence of excessive airspeed or maneuvers that would lead to a structural overload and failure of the wings. Turbulence was present in the area, although it was not believed to be severe and likely did not contribute to the failure. An examination of the airplane wreckage revealed that the left wing spar had buckled upward near the fuselage and the left wing had wrapped around the fuselage near the cockpit. There was compression buckling of the lower spar cap of the left wing's rear spar and compression buckling of the upper and lower spar caps of the right wing's rear spar. The compression damage to both rear spars and the upward buckling of the left wing's main spar are evidence of upward and downward bending of both wings. The upward and downward bending of the wings is consistent with aerodynamic flutter. The structural loading at the inboard section of the left wing was further increased as the trailing edges of the outboard sections moved up and down. Ultimately the left wing failed as it bent upward near the root. Aerodynamic flutter can occur when there is insufficient stiffness in the structure or when the flight controls are not mass-balanced.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various sources and may have traveled in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft incident report.Climbing through FL 230, an Edelweiss Airbus 330-243 experienced an uncontained engine failure of the No. 1 engine.  The flight crew declared an emergency and returned to Miami International Airport, Miami, Florida, to execute an uneventful single-engine landing.  Postincident examination revealed that an oil fire in the high pressure (HP)/intermediate pressure (IP) turbine bearing chamber internal oil vent tube of the No. 1 engine burned through the tube, allowing hot gases into the HP/IP turbine bearing chamber.  The hot gases blew the oil past the oil seals, igniting the rear area of the bearing chamber and providing enough heat to fracture the IP turbine disk drive arm, which caused the disk to overspeed and release its blades through the IP turbine case.  Some of the blades impacted the left wing and a portion of the fuselage.  Due to the fire damage to the No. 1 engine and the loss of a significant portion of the internal vent tube and associated heat shield, the exact cause of the vent tube oil fire initiation is unknown. However, examination of the No. 2 engine's vent tube revealed that it was blocked with carbon deposits.  Because both engines had the same operating time and history, it is likely that the event engine had a similar blockage of its vent tube and that the blockage contributed to the initiation of the oil fire.At the time of the uncontained engine failure, Mobil Jet Oil (MJO) 291 was being used in the incident engines. MJO 291 was approved for use in Trent 700 engines in 1996 but Edelweiss was the only operator using that type of oil.  The incident investigation revealed that the use of MJO 291 produced coking in the sister engine and, by inference, the incident engine's HP/IP bearing chamber internal oil vent tube which resulted in a catastrophic engine failure. There had been a demonstrated coking problem in the same area with another previously approved oil.  A 1999 Rolls-Royce service bulletin (SB) removed ASTO 560 from the list of oils approved for use in Trent series 700 and 800 engines after it was found that significant carbon accumulation was confined to operations using ASTO 560. After the deletion of ASTO 560 from the list of approved oils, no significant buildup of carbon was found in engines over 10,000 hours. As a result, CAA and Rolls-Royce, based upon data available and mindful of the additional threat of a maintenance error associated with such inspections, deleted the 3,000-hour requirement for the on-wing inspection of the HP/IP bearing chamber internal oil vent tube for coking.  If the 3,000-hour requirement to inspect for coking had remained in place, it is likely that the coking in the incident engines would have been found and the engine would not have suffered a failure.  Each time a new oil is introduced, procedures should be developed and implemented to inspect those areas where engine testing or in-service experience has indicated carbon formation is possible - until such time as there is sufficient in-service engine data to support the case for no longer doing so.The incident flight was on an ETOPS route, which, in the event of an engine shutdown, allows one engine operation for up to 180 minutes.  It is recognized that if the flight crew did shut down one engine, the flight could have continued for that time with an unspecified risk for the remaining engine to fail.  Since the sister engine had an unusual coke formation also, by both engines not being monitored after the induction of the new oil, it allowed for the potential of an erosion into the safety margin allowed by ETOPS. This investigation highlights that engine manufactures should take into account the level of risk associated with approving new engine/oil combinations.  Operators also need to take into account the introduction of new oils into their fleets and ensure that sufficient evidence exists to support their use.",
            "probable_cause": "an uncontained engine failure that resulted from the coking (carbon build-up) in a vent tube which led to a fire and the subsequent liberation of the IP turbine blades.  Contributing to the cause of the uncontained engine failure was the absence of measures to adequately monitor the in-service performance of a new engine/oil combination. "

With insufficient runway remaining on which to land and obstacles at the end of the runway that made a straight-ahead off-airport landing hazardous, the flight instructor attempted to maneuver toward the ramp area adjacent to the runway. The airplane subsequently stalled, impacted the runway in a nose-down attitude, and came to rest inverted. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failures or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The flight instructor stated that the takeoff was initiated with the carburetor heat off, despite a placard in the airplane requiring the use of carburetor heat during takeoff and landing. Although the weather conditions at the time of takeoff were conducive to the formation of carburetor ice at glide and cruise power at the time of the accident, it was not possible to determine whether carburetor ice was a factor in the accident. Weight and balance calculations revealed that the airplane was loaded about 68 pounds over its maximum allowable gross weight, and calculated density altitude at the airport about the time of the accident was more than 2,000 feet. Despite these factors, both of which would have adversely affected both the distance required for takeoff and the airplane\u2019s rate of climb once airborne, the pilots elected to conduct an intersection takeoff, which reduced the available runway takeoff distance by nearly 20% and also reduced the diversionary options available in the event of a loss of engine power.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor\u2019s and the pilot\u2019s failure to maintain airspeed after a partial loss of engine power after takeoff for reasons that could not be determined during postaccident examination, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of airplane control. Contributing to the accident were the pilots\u2019 decisions to operate the airplane above its maximum allowable gross weight and to perform an intersection takeoff."

The airstrip had been used by the pilot in the past.  Near the end of the landing roll, the left main landing gear strut fractured above the left wheel axle.  The wheel and the lower end of the gear strut separated from the airplane.  The upper portion of the gear strut dug into the ground, and the airplane nosed over.  The airplane received damage to the right wing, propeller, the vertical stabilizer, and the rudder.  The lower end of the gear strut has four holes drilled through the metal to facilitate the installation of the wheel axle and brake assembly.  An examination of the landing gear strut found areas of cracking, typical of fatigue, emanating from the inboard edge of the forward, upper bolt hole.  One crack developed in an area of two small corrosion pits in the drilled hole.  A second crack developed in an area of the fillet between the drilled hole, and the inboard surface of the strut.  The cracks from the two areas combined to form one crack laterally across the strut and through the aft, upper bolt hole.

He did not return to the airport at the predetermined time, and the wreckage was located on the steep slope of a summit the following day. Flight data recovered from the pilot's handheld GPS unit revealed a track that was consistent with ridge and thermal soaring. For about the first hour of flight the glider maintained ground clearances of between 1,600 and 5,000 feet. For the last 16 minutes of flight the glider continued ridge soaring with reduced ground clearances of between 250 and 1,400 feet. The glider then crested a peak and returned to a valley area performing a figure eight turn. During the last turn the recorded ground speed fell below the stall speed of the glider. Analysis of the weather at the accident site indicated the presence of turbulence and downdrafts, in addition to wind directions that would have indicated an airspeed that was even lower than the ground speed recorded by the GPS. Glider instrumentation, wreckage, and ground scars were consistent with a stall/spin event.

The pilot-owner based the quantity on the fuel gauge reading and his 9 years' experience with the airplane, but did not \"stick\" the tank. Another pilot, seated in the front seat, stated that the pilot-owner also observed \"some\" fuel in the auxiliary fuel tank, as \"indicated by the float.\" After taking off and climbing the airplane to 3,000 feet, the pilot-owner demonstrated some maneuvers, which the front seat pilot then performed. None of the maneuvers were aerobatic, as fuel would have spilled from the non-sealed auxiliary tank. After maneuvering, the pilot-owner advanced the throttle to return to the airport, but the engine remained at what he thought was \"low power\" with \"engine sound continuous - perhaps just above idle.\" The pilot-owner established a glide, activated the fuel boost pump, moved the fuel selector to the auxiliary tank, checked both magnetos, and tried various throttle settings before advancing the throttle to full and returning the fuel selector to the main tank. The pilot-owner subsequently performed a forced landing to a corn field, and upon touchdown, the landing gear sheared and the airplane nosed over. The following day, a Federal Aviation Administration examination of the airplane revealed damage to the left wing spar and rudder, and no fuel present in the fuel tanks, fuel lines or gascolator. An unknown quantity of fuel had leaked out of the auxiliary fuel tank. The pilot-owner subsequently noted, \"it has become obvious that the engine quit for a lack of fuel,\" and that he felt the reason the auxiliary fuel did not \"re-start\" the engine was due to vapor lock.

He applied aft cyclic to slow the helicopter and noticed the rotor rpm starting to decay. After he lowered the collective in an attempt to regain rotor rpm everything appeared to stabilize. The pilot then increased the collective to see if he could re-establish cruise power, but the increase in collective resulted in the low rotor aural warning activating. When the pilot lowered the collective, the warning went out, and when he tried to maintain rotor rpm by using the throttle in the manual mode there was no change, which resulted in the warning system activating again. The pilot then lowered the collective, returned the throttle to the normal position and began a descent, touching down in soft dirt and sliding forward before coming to rest upright. The helicopter was substantially damaged as a result of the hard landing, which separated the tail section. During the postaccident examination, the engine was tested in the gas generator and the power turbine modes, as well as the electronic engine control (EEC) and mechanical engine control (MEC) modes. The engine was observed to run normally to all inputs in gas generator, EEC and MEC control modes, with manual override also observed to function normally.

After flying for several hours, he saw the \"glow of [city] lights\" and thought it was his destination. He attempted to contact the airport by radio, but did not receive a response. He stated that, at that time, he was unable to pick up the VOR. At that point he realized that he must have drifted north and off of his intended heading. He said he adjusted his heading to the southwest, and climbed to a higher altitude. Shortly thereafter, he located his destination, and through radio contact, turned on the runway lights. As he flew over the airport, the airplane's engine began to lose power and then it \"cut out.\" He circled around the airport as he descended and set up for a forced landing on runway 22. On the final approach, he realized that he wasn't going to make the runway. He said that he \"increased the [airplane's] angle of attack,\" but the airplane fell short of the runway. The airplane's right wing struck a fence post and the airplane impacted the terrain approximately 50 yards short of the runway threshold. The airplane's right wing spar was bent outboard of the wing strut, and the nose landing gear was separated from the gear fork. An on-site examination of the airplane revealed that both wing fuel tanks were empty. ",

After crossing over the numbers, the airplane floated longer than the pilot anticipated and touched down just before the 3,000-foot marker. The touchdown was straight and centered. The pilot felt comfortable that he had plenty of runway to safely bring the airplane to a stop and was expecting a smooth and straight rollout. Soon after touchdown, the airplane pulled to the left, and the pilot responded by applying brakes, with more pressure on the right brake. The airplane corrected slightly, and he eased off the brakes. The airplane was still pulling left, so he repeated the process of right-dominated braking, but the plane continued to pull left. At this point, the pilot realized that he was not going to be able to keep the airplane on the runway. He considered locking up the brakes and \u201criding it out\u201d but thought that he could execute a go-around. According to the pilot, he advanced the throttle and eased back on the control stick, and the engine did not respond. The airplane nosed up, stalled, and came down off the left side of the runway. Examination of the flight controls and brake system did not show any preexisting mechanical malfunction or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The reason for the engine\u2019s lack of response, as reported by the pilot, when he tried to initiate a go-around could not be verified. It is unknown whether a go-around with normal throttle response so late in the landing/rollout sequence could have prevented the accident. The reported wind at the airport about 5 minutes before the accident was from 270 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 16 knots. Since the pilot landed on runway 9, the airplane would have encountered a direct tailwind of at least 12 knots, not taking into account the reported 16-knot gusts. It is likely that the tailwind influenced the airplane\u2019s pull to the left after touchdown.",

The official automated surface observation system (ASOS) observation at the time of the accident included winds from 170 degrees at 19 knots with higher gusts to 26 knots, yeilding a crosswind component that varied from 12 to 19 knots.  The pilot reported that the flight was smooth until about 15 minutes from landing at Sedona when turbulence was encountered.  Nearing the airport, he obtained the surface weather from the ASOS recording and noted that the winds were given as from 170 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 21 variable to 190 degrees at 12 knots with higher gusts to 23.  The pilot selected runway 21 and said that during the approach, \"a change in airspeed of 15 knots was observable.\"  He noted that he reduced power after touchdown and a gust of wind \"lifted the aircraft off the runway and I started porpoising and hit the tail on the runway.\"  The accident sequence was witnessed by the owner of a fixed-base operator (FBO) on the airport.  He reported that the pilot was trying to land on runway 21 with a strong quartering headwind that had a significant gust component.  He saw the airplane bounce off the main gear and begin a series of porpoise like pilot induced oscillations where the airplane bounced from the nose wheel to the main gear and back again, with an increasing amplitude.  On the fourth porpoise, the airplane's tail struck the runway.  According to the limitations section of the Cessna T206H Pilot Operating Handbook, the airplane's maximum demonstrated crosswind capability is 15 knots.  Engineering personnel from Cessna reported that the 15-knot crosswind capability is not a limitation, it is only the maximum crosswind component that the aircraft was landed in during certification flight testing.

The private pilot received minor injuries. The passenger was uninjured. The flight departed from Columbus Airport (CSG), Columbus, Georgia, about 0930, destined for Boca Raton Airport (BCT), Boca Raton, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR flight plan was filed for the personal flight, conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, on the day before the accident occurred, he and his wife had departed Southwest Michigan Regional Airport (BEH), Benton Harbor, Michigan, at approximately 1015 then flew approximately 1.5 hours to Monroe County Airport (BMG), Bloomington, Indiana for fuel. After landing at BMG, they had the airplane refueled, filling the tanks with 24 gallons of fuel and then departed for CSG. After flying 3.2 hours, they landed at CSG. The pilot then had the airplane refueled once again, topping the fuel tanks off with 54.3 gallons of fuel and then checked in to a hotel.The following morning, the pilot and his wife returned to CSG from the hotel and departed for BCT at approximately 0930. The pilot advised that the flight was very pleasant with some clouds and build up near Sebring, Florida and that he had entered and flown in instrument meteorological conditions for approximately 42 minutes while at their cruising altitude of 5,000 feet above mean sea level (msl) without any problems. As they were handed off to Palm Beach Approach, they descended to 4,000 feet msl, and were gradually descended down to 2,000 feet msl. A little while later after leveling at 2,000 feet msl they were cleared to 1,000 feet msl. and were handed off to BCT control tower. Moments later, the airplane began shaking violently, a \"loud noise\" was heard, and the propeller stopped rotating, and then began windmilling slowly. The engine however, would not produce any power. The tower then cleared them for a visual approach to runway 05. The pilot realized that they were not going to make the airport and he and his wife began looking for an \"open area\" to make an \"engine out\" landing while he trimmed the airplane and tried to restart the engine. He then spotted what used to be a polo field which was being developed into home sites and turned towards it. He thought it was his only chance to land in an unobstructed area. His wife meanwhile spotted \"wires\" and advised him of them while he continued to fly the airplane and attempted to restart the engine. Then after clearing the last of the \"wires\" he turned the airplane to align it with the polo field and landed. The ground was soft and sandy however, and during the landing roll, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted. The pilot and his wife then released their safety harnesses and egressed.A preliminary examination by a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector indicated that the vertical stabilizer was substantially damaged.

            "narrative": "On April 14, 2015, about 0815 Pacific daylight time, an experimental amateur-built Pitts S2E airplane, N75BH, was destroyed when it collided with trees and mountainous terrain about 3 miles northeast of Lebec, California. The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country personal flight under Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91, when the accident occurred. The airline transport pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) were reported in the area of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed. The accident flight originated at the Bakersfield Airport, Bakersfield, California about 0748, en route to Blythe, California. Family members reported that the pilot recently purchased the airplane and it was being flown to his home in Missouri when the accident occurred. When the airplane did not arrive in Blythe, a concerned family member notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA subsequently issued an alert notice (ALNOT) at 1502.  On April 15, about 1000, the airplane's fragmented wreckage was located by a worker in a remote area of a private ranch.  On April 16, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) examined the wreckage. The on-scene investigation revealed that the airplane impacted a mountainous tree-covered ridgeline, at an elevation of about 4,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The debris field was about 500 feet long from the first observed point of impact. All of the airplane's major components were found at the wreckage site. On April 17, investigators from the NTSB examined the engine and airframe at the facilities of Air Transport, Phoenix, Arizona; the examination revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.    The closest weather reporting facility was Sandberg (KSDB), about 10 miles southeast of the accident site. At 0813, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) reported, in part: Wind  from 340 degrees at 25 knots, peak gusts to 35 knots; visibility, 1 statute mile; clouds and sky condition, 200 feet overcast; temperature, 6 degrees C; dew point, 4 degrees C; altimeter, 30.18 inHg. Witnesses located near the accident site, at the time of the accident, reported that weather conditions were much worse than that being reported at the airport. ",

The airplane was quiet, and was observed gliding with its wings tipping back and forth.  Next, it was observed to corkscrew, or spiral to the ground.  The airplane's propeller was a highly modified constant speed Hamilton Standard 12D40 hub.  Neither of the two 7 pound counterweights were found at the accident site.  Examination of the #2 counterweight bracket revealed a fatigue crack at the proximal end of the counterweight slot.  The propeller's shim plates exhibited impact signatures of the two blades indicating an angular difference of 10 degrees.  The propeller's cylinder was crushed on one side, locking the piston inside the cylinder; the location of the piston inside the cylinder correlated to a blade angle of 34.9 degrees.  If a propeller counterweight had separated in flight, aerodynamic forces would have driven the blade towards fine pitch or low blade angle.  The blade's rotation would be limited to the low blade angle, of 24 degrees, by the remaining portion of its counterweight bracket arm which would contact and be stopped by the propeller\u2019s barrel.  If one blade was at the low blade angle of 24 degrees, the measured angular difference of 10 degrees, would indicate that the other blade was at an angle of 34 degrees.  The agreement between this derived blade angle of 34 degrees and the piston position of 34.9 degrees suggests that one blade was still slaved to its counterweight at the time of impact and one blade was not.",

The pilot and one passenger were seriously injured, and two passengers sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by a private individual. Day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and a flight plan had not been filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight which was destined for Tyler Pounds Regional Airport (TYR), Tyler, Texas.The pilot reported that during his soft field takeoff from the turf runway the airplane had lifted off at an indicated airspeed of 80 mph. As the airplane neared the departure end of the runway the pilot noticed the airplane was not climbing as expected, the indicated airspeed seemed unreliable, and the controls felt mushy and near stall speed. The airplane then impacted trees and the roof of an unoccupied home. The engine separated and fell inside the home which resulted in a structure fire that substantially damaged the home. The airplane impacted terrain about 50 feet from the burning home and came to rest upright after impacting two nearly full propane storage tanks. There was no release of propane and there was no postimpact fire at the location of the main wreckage. Several persons at another nearby home witness the impact and responded immediately to assist the four occupants to exit the wreckage.",

According to the flight crew statements, a large compressor stall and a muffled explosion were felt, followed by the No. 2 engine rollback and No. 2 engine fire warning indication.  The flight crew performed an air turnback and made a successful three-engine landing at DTW.  No injuries were reported.  Examination of the airplane revealed minor impact damage to the left wing, flaps, ailerons, and horizontal stabilizer.  Initial examination of the engine revealed evidence of an undercowl fire, three burn-through holes on the No. 2 engine outboard core cowl, numerous exit hole penetrations in the rear turbine case, and a punctured No. 4 bearing compartment oil pressure supply line.  Disassembly of the No. 2 engine revealed no damage upstream of the stage 3 low pressure turbine (LPT); one stage 3 LPT outer transition duct segment and two stage 3 LPT vane clusters were missing from their normally installed position, and extensive damage downstream of the stage 3 LPT vane clusters was found.  The stage 3 LPT outer transition duct segments were approved but were an older configuration utilizing the riveted rear seal plate design that was prone to failure and had been superceded by a preferred design that incorporated an integral rear seal.Comparing the airplane and engine damage to the requirements for engine debris containment and safety analysis at the time the engine was certificated revealed that the engine did not comply with the containment requirements set forth in Parts 33.19 and 33.75.The undercowl fire was due to a failure of the rear riveted seal plates of the missing stage 3 outer transition duct segment that allowed hot gas path air under the duct segment, causing it to thermally distort and disengage from the rear turbine case.  Once disengaged from the rear turbine case, the stage 3 outer transition duct segment released into the gaspath where it fractured all of the stage 3 LPT blades, which propelled blade fragments through the rear turbine case that punctured the No. 4 bearing oil pressure supply tube.  The atomizing oil mist from the No. 4 bearing oil pressure supply tube ignited when it contacted the hot engine case, which created the undercowl fire.",
