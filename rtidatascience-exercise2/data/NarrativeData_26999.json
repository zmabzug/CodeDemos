The pilot had been issued a student pilot certificate about 7 years before the accident; however, no pilot flight logbooks were recovered, so the pilot\u2019s level of training could not be determined. A postaccident examination of the airframe and flight control system revealed no anomalies. An examination of the engine showed that all of the teeth of one of the two gears in the propeller reduction gearbox were broken off. Additionally, the ball retaining cage on one of the ball bearings that supported the propeller shaft had failed, and several of the balls were missing from the bearing. A sludgelike substance resembling old oil was found in the gear reduction case, and no liquid oil was found, which is indicative of inadequate maintenance. No airplane maintenance records were found. Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the bearing and gear in the propeller reduction gearbox failed as a result of inadequate maintenance (lack of lubrication), which resulted in a loss of propeller thrust and reduced the airplane\u2019s airspeed. The pilot did not obtain adequate airspeed (by lowering the nose), which led to the exceedance of the airplane\u2019s critical angle-of-attack and a subsequent stall and spin to the ground. Because the pilot only held a student pilot certificate with an unknown level of training over the previous 7 years, it is likely that he did not have sufficient experience to handle the in-flight emergency.",

On landing roll the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid off of the runway. Examination of the right main landing gear revealed the drag brace was fractured. The fracture was located at the lower side of a transition from a smaller internal diameter on the upper piece to a larger internal diameter on the lower piece. The region of the fracture surface was flat and perpendicular to the tube longitudinal axis. The region had a smooth, curving boundary, also consistent with fatigue. The fatigue features emanated from multiple origins at the inner surface of the tube.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive (AD) requiring an inspections of main landing gear drag stay units. The AD was prompted by the fracture of a drag stay tube from fatigue cracking that initiated from an improperly machined transition radius at the inner surface of the tube. According to Fokker ,the Fokker F27 Mark 500 airplanes (such as the incident airplane) were not equipped with drag stay units having part number 200261001, 200485001, or 200684001.

The Cessna was departing on runway 19 with a left climbing turnout northbound, and the Grumman F6F-5 warbird was returning to land and had entered the airport traffic area from the north.  The collision occurred about midfield on the left downwind leg for runway 19 when the Grumman overtook the climbing Cessna.  The Grumman pilot was monitoring the Unicom frequency and reported several miles from the airport inbound for the overhead approach to runway 19.  He overheard other aircraft in the pattern and decided to follow an F-86 warbird that was turning base to final for an overhead approach.  He flew over the runway centerline about 600 feet above ground level.  Near the departure end of the runway he looked left to see if there was any traffic on the downwind leg.  No traffic was observed so he announced that he was in the left break for downwind and turned left to the downwind leg and climbed to the pattern altitude.  At pattern altitude he was abeam the departure end of the runway.  He located his reported traffic in the pattern; one was on final, one on base, and the F-86 was on his right on a wide downwind and ahead of him.  He chose to follow the F-86.  About midfield, while straight and level on the downwind leg, the pilot started the Before Landing Check List.  During that procedure he checked his position relative to the runway.  At that instant, another aircraft came into view from below and ahead of him and the collision occurred.  He transmitted the collision information and subsequently landed with substantial damage to the left wing.  The left wing of the Grumman impacted at the base of the rudder and vertical stabilizer of the Cessna, thus severing it from the airplane.  The uncontrolled airport was sponsoring an Air Expo, which consisted of static and aerial formation flights, flybys, and parachuting events.  The airport routinely provides an aeronautical advisory station (CTAF) on 122.725 MHz, and provides wind and preferred runway information.  The CTAF operator at the airport did not recall hearing the Cessna on frequency.  Visual examination of the Cessna's two damaged communication radios with only 25 kc frequency spacing revealed the top radio was selected to 122.7, and the other was 121.902 MHz.  The Grumman airplane had one with 25 kc frequency spacing; however, the pilot was using a handheld VHF radio for transmissions on 75 kc spacing for the airport's CTAF frequency, 122.725.",

Disturbed adhesive and remnants of old clear coat was noted at the seam of the fixed coupling adapter on the aft end of the drive shaft. Disassembly inspection of the No. 5 tail rotor drive shaft driveshaft revealed rotational scoring on the outer surface of the shaft tube and inner surface of the splined adapter at the forward end of driveshaft assembly. In May 1999, the helicopter was involved in a tail rotor sudden stoppage which resulted in damage to at least one tail rotor blade, and tail rotor hub and blades being \"\u2026scrapped due to [tail rotor] sudden stoppage.\" The tail rotor driveshafts were not replaced at that time as required by the maintenance manual, and remained installed until 2004, when they were removed for inspection due to the occurrence in May 1999. The tail rotor drive shafts were inspected and approved for return to service in 2004, by the same facility that had scrapped the tail rotor blades in 1999, which is contrary to the maintenance manual. The driveshafts were reinstalled, and at the time of the accident, the No. 5 tail rotor driveshaft had accumulated 245.8 hours since inspection, and 4,087.4 hours since new. NTSB review of photographs of the tail rotor blades installed in May 1999, revealed evidence of buckling of the skin near the tip of both blades.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of company maintenance personnel to replace the tail rotor drive shafts following tail rotor blade damage in 1999, the failure of maintenance personnel to replace the tail rotor drive shafts in 2004, following their knowledge that the tail rotor blades and hub were scrapped due to tail rotor blade damage, and improper inspection and return to service by an FAA approved repair station for their failure to condemn the tail rotor drive shafts in 2004, all of which resulted in failure of the No. 5 tail rotor drive shaft during approach for landing."

The airplane began a right turn immediately after departure and appeared to be going slow.  A witness was able to distinguish the individual propeller blades on the right engine, while the left engine propeller blades were indistinguishable.  The airplane stopped turning and flew for an estimated 1/4-mile at an altitude of 100 feet.  The airplane then continued the right turn at a steep bank angle before disappearing from sight.  Then the witness observed a plume of smoke.  White and gray matter, along with two ferrous slivers, contaminated the chip detector on the right engine.  The airplane had a rudder assist system installed.  The rudder assist provided additional directional control in the event of a loss of power on either engine.  The NATOPS manual specified that the rudder assist switch should be in the ON position for takeoff, landing, and in the event of single-engine operation.  The rudder boost switch was in the off position, and the rudder boost actuator in the empennage was in the retracted (off) position.  The owner had experienced a problem with the flight controls the previous year and did not fly with the rudder assist ON.  The accident flight had the lowest acceleration rate, and attained the lowest maximum speed, compared to GPS data from the seven previous flights.  It was traveling nearly 20 knots slower, about 100 knots, than the bulk of the other flights when it attempted to lift off.  The airplane was between the 2,000- and 3,000-foot runway markers (less than halfway down the runway) when it lifted off and began the right turn.  Due to the extensive disintegration of the airplane in the impact sequence, the seating positions for the three occupants could not be determined.  One of the occupants was the aircraft owner, who held a private certificate with a single-engine land rating, was known to have previously flown the airplane on contract flights from both the left and right seats.  A second pilot was the normal copilot for all previous contract flights; his certificates had been revoked by the FAA.

Subsequently, the pilot became aware of two drainage ditches crossing perpendicular to his intended path.  The airplane had enough speed to cross the first ditch; however, the main landing gear collided with the second ditch resulting in a nose over.  The airplane came to rest in the inverted position.

He had routine contact with air traffic control, and was advised by the controller to maintain 6,000 feet at 0501 hours when the airplane was 11 miles from the destination airport. Two minutes later the flight was cleared for a visual approach to follow a preceding Boeing 737 and advised to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency at the airport. The destination airport was equipped with an air traffic control tower but it was closed overnight. The accident flight's radar-derived flight path showed that the pilot altered his flight course to the west, most likely for spacing from the airplane ahead, and descended into the water as he began a turn back toward the airport. The majority of the wreckage sank in 4,800 feet of water and was not recovered, so examinations and testing could not be performed. As a result, the functionality of the altitude and attitude instruments in the cockpit could not be determined. A performance study showed, however, that the airspeed, pitch, rates of descent, and bank angles of the airplane during the approach were within expected normal ranges, and the pilot did not make any transmissions during the approach that indicated he was having any problems. In fact, another cargo flight crew that landed just prior to the accident airplane and an airport employee reported that the pilot transmitted that he was landing on the active runway, and was 7 miles from landing. Radar data showed that when the airplane was 6.5 miles from the airport, at the location of the last recorded radar return, the radar target's mode C altitude report showed an altitude of minus 100 feet mean sea level. The pilot most likely descended into the ocean because he became spatially disoriented. Although visual meteorological conditions prevailed, no natural horizon and few external visual references were available during the visual approach. This increased the importance of monitoring flight instruments to maintain awareness of the airplane attitude and altitude. The pilot's tasks during the approach, however, included maintaining visual separation from the airplane ahead and lining up with the destination runway. These tasks required visual attention outside the cockpit. These competing tasks probably created shifting visual frames of reference, left the pilot vulnerable to common visual and vestibular illusions, and reduced his awareness of the airplane's attitude, altitude and trajectory.",

The non-instrument rated commercial pilot and the 5 passengers aboard the airplane were fatally injured.  The airplane was owned and operated by Servicio Aereo Manchupo, of Trinidad, Bolivia.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight for which a VFR flight plan was filed.  The business flight originated from Trinidad at 1245 local.  The round-robin flight was scheduled to transport personnel and cargo to 3 intermediate airstrips (Nuevamente, Cashaschanes and Sumacal) servicing ranches also owned and operated by the owner of the airplane.The foreman that managed the ranch where the airplane intended to land witnessed the accident.  He reported observing the airplane on a left base entry to runway 15.  He added that the airplane overshot the extended centerline for the runway and the airplane was banked into a left turn as it appeared to be attempting to get re-established on the final approach course.  During the turn, the left wing of the airplane collided with the trunk of a 35-foot tall tree located approximately 100 feet west of the extended centerline for runway 15.The accident investigation is under the jurisdiction and control of the Government of the Republic of Bolivia.

The private pilot received serious injuries. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which was departing from Greenbrier Valley Airport (LWB) at the time of the accident. The personal flight had an intended destination of Hanover County Municipal Airport (OFP), Ashland, Virginia. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to a witness who was working at the airport, the pilot began the takeoff roll at the approach end of runway 04 and the airplane lifted off within the first 2000 feet of the runway. The takeoff roll and initial climb appeared \"normal\", and the engine/propeller sounded \"normal\". About 200 feet above ground level the airplane leveled off and continued down the runway centerline. At that time the landing gear remained down, and the flaps remained partially deployed. Then the airplane began a left turn, which increased to a \"very sharp\" left bank and the nose \"dropped\". The wings had rolled back toward level just as the airplane went out of view. A second witness located in a parking lot near the departure end of the runway stated that she saw the airplane \"Wig-Waging,\" which she later described as the wings rolling from left to right at a relatively steep angle but could not recall how steep of an angle it was, but said it was \"considerably greater than normal takeoffs\" she had seen. She stated that she watched the airplane then level its bank angle, then pitched up, and shortly thereafter the nose \"came down.\" She watched the airplane impact the ground and she ran to provide assistance to the pilot.The airplane initially impacted a fence (wood post and wire construction) and then terrain in a pasture about 1/4 mile to the left of the runway 04 centerline, abeam the 1000 foot marker for the reciprocal (22) runway. The accident debris path was oriented on a 323 degree (true) heading, began at a broken fence post located at N 37.86520 / W 80.39936, and was approximately 50 yards long. The major components of the airplane were located with the main wreckage with the exception of the left main landing gear, located about 15 feet from the initial impact point, and the propeller/hub assembly, which was located about 10 feet to the southwest of the main wreckage.",

Personnel from the Walton County, Florida, Emergency Operations Center, stated that at 0021 they received a call from a hospital in DeFuniak Springs, requesting the Airheart One helicopter to transport a patient to Pensacola, Florida. The dispatcher then contacted the pilot of Airheart One and advised him of the request. The pilot stated he would have to check the weather and get back to him. At 0035, the pilot called back and stated they would take the flight. At 0041, the paramedic on Airheart One called via radio and reported they were airborne with three persons on board, 2 hours 20 minutes of fuel, and an estimated time en route to the hospital of 10 minutes. At 0043, the paramedic reported that due to weather they were returning to base. The dispatcher did not talk with the flight after this. At 0050, the dispatcher cleared the Airheart One call, believing that they were back at base due to the short flight time. At 0610, the relief pilot that was coming on duty called the Emergency Operations Center and advised that Airheart One was not at base. Search and rescue operations were initiated and the wreckage of the helicopter was located in Choctawhatchee Bay about 0820. A witness, who was fishing on the northwest side of the Highway 331 bridge reported that between 0030 and 0100, he observed a helicopter flying from south to north parallel to the bridge on the east side. The weather was lightning and thunder and it was just starting to drizzle and rain. He observed the helicopter either fly into a big cloud or fly behind the big cloud. He then saw lightning. He then saw the helicopter making a \"U Turn\" toward the east and then descend at a 45-degree angle to the water. He observed the helicopter by the red light on the belly. He left shortly after this because of the rain. Recorded radar data from Eglin Air Force Base showed that the flight departed the Walton County Sheriff's Department heliport and was first observed on radar at 0040:37 while at 300 feet, 1/10 of a mile east-southeast of the heliport. The flight climbed to 900 feet, while proceeding north bound, across the bay, flying parallel to Highway 331 Bridge. The flight then descended to between 700 and 800 feet. At 0042:18, the flight initiated a turn to the east and at 0042:49, the last radar contact was recorded when the flight was at 700 feet, flying on an east-southeast heading. This position was about 3/4 mile to the east-northeast of the crash site. The 2353 Destin-Ft. Walton Beach Airport, automated surface weather observation was visibility 7 statute miles, ceiling 800 feet broken with remarks lightning distant north, ceiling 700 variable 1300. The airport is located 16.2 nautical miles west of the accident site. The Destin 0053 weather was visibility 7 statute miles, ceiling 600 feet broken, 1,500 feet overcast., remarks lightning distant southeast. The 2355 surface weather observation taken at the Valparaiso/Okaloosa-Eglin AFB was visibility 7 statute, clouds 800 feet scattered, ceiling 2,000 feet overcast with thunderstorm, remarks thunderstorm northeast and east moving southeast. The airport is located 20 nautical miles west-northwest of the accident site. Weather radar data obtained from the Eglin AFB Doppler Weather Radar System show that weak weather echoes were present in the area of the accident at the time of the accident. Additionally, an intense to extreme weather echo was present about 10 nautical miles north of the accident site. At the time of the accident Airmet IFR MIAS WA 200145 was in effect for the accident area. The Airmet called for occasional ceilings below 1,000 feet, visibility below 3 miles, precipitation, mist, and fog. The Airmet was issued at 2045 on October 19, 2004, and was valid until 0300 on October 20, 2004. The helicopter operator's operations manual states that the pilot-in-command is responsible for obtaining a weather briefing. The manual establishes weather minimums for night visual flight rules EMS helicopter operations. The minimums are visual ground light reference, enough to properly control the helicopter, and for local flights within 30 nautical miles of base the cloud ceiling should be a minimum of 800 feet agl and visibility greater than 2 miles. For preflight planning the cloud ceiling should be 1,000 feet agl and visibility should be 3 miles. Metro Aviation, Inc. uses a commercial, computer based, weather service at the Santa Rosa Beach base. The system was online at the time of the accident and received data 6 hours before and 6 hours after the accident. The radar and text data on the system was current and the system had been used to check weather throughout the day of the accident. The exact weather products accessed by the accident pilot could not be identified. Post crash examination of the helicopter showed no evidence of precrash mechanical failure or malfunction of the helicopter structure, flight control system, electrical system, hydraulic system, main rotor system and transmission, tail rotor system, and powerplants and drive shafts. There was no evidence of lightning strike on the helicopter. Postmortem examination of the pilot and 2 medical crewmembers and testing of toxicology samples showed no evidence that could be considered causal to the accident.",

After touchdown the pilot announced to the passenger of having no brakes and retracted the flaps.  She announced to the passenger again of, \"...still no brakes\"; the airplane did not begin to slow until the flaps were retracted.  The airplane traveled off the end of the runway and a left skid was initiated causing the right main landing gear to collapse.  She further reported, \"Note: this runway has been seal coated with black paint sealer.  It is very slick when wet.  Much more so than asphalt.\"  Examination of the main landing gear tires by FAA revealed the damage was consistent with hydroplaning.  Additionally, \"Tread reversal is evident particularly on the right main tire.  Both tires had a section of approximately 10 inches long across the entire width where tread separation was evident.\"  Runway 9-27 was crack sealed and coal-tar sealer/rejuvenator was applied before the accident date.  Following the process, wet friction tests on treated and untreated areas of the runway revealed the treated area of the runway experienced a loss of 0.05 to 0.08 Mu (friction coefficient value) when compared with the untreated area, but the total treated area had an average of 0.72 Mu.

The pilot described it as a \"one way\" strip, explaining that the landing direction was \"uphill\" and the takeoff direction was \"downhill.\" The pilot had operated into and out of the airstrip about 20 times previously. All those flights, as well as that day's inbound flight and landing, were uneventful. After boarding and start up, the pilot back-taxied to the top of the rise that constituted the beginning of the runway. That section of the runway was more steeply sloped (downhill) than the rest of the runway. As the pilot reached the beginning of the runway, he made a 180-degree left turn, and began the takeoff roll; he did not straighten the tailwheel prior to application of takeoff power. As soon as the pilot added takeoff power, the nose \"went about 15 degrees left.\" The pilot continued the takeoff attempt, and tried to recover the desired ground track by application of full right rudder. The pilot saw that the airplane was headed for a golf cart, with a person seated in it, that was situated about 80 feet off the left side of the runway. The pilot opted to turn more sharply left in order to avoid the cart and person, and this action took the airplane on a track that was more divergent from the runway axis. The left main landing gear struck a hummock and fracture-separated from the airplane, which resulted in lower fuselage and left wing ground contact. The airplane slid to a stop, with substantial damage to the fuselage and left wing. The pilot stated that the wind was \"way under\" 10 mph, coming onto the right side of the airplane during the takeoff attempt. He reported that he did not abandon the takeoff attempt at the initial veer off, because he was concerned about the airplane nosing over onto its back during an attempt to stop. One passenger reported that the initial directional excursion was \"almost immediately\" about 45 degrees off the runway axis. Post-accident examination of the airplane did not reveal any pre-impact conditions which would have precluded normal operation. Review of weight and balance information indicated that the center of gravity was very slightly forward of the forward limit, and the airplane might have been very slightly above its maximum certificated takeoff weight. Neither condition would have contributed to the loss of directional control. ",

The pilot noted that when he attempted to lower the landing gear on approach to the intended destination nothing happened.  He elected to divert to an airport with additional capabilities and assistance available.  The pilot stated that he executed the emergency gear extension procedure, however, this procedure was not successful.  The left main landing gear appeared to be fully extended, the nose landing gear was in a \"dragging\" condition, and the right main landing gear was retracted when observed by the tower controller prior to landing.  The pilot noted that the red gear unlocked indicator light was illuminated and the green landing gear down/locked indicators were not illuminated.  Since no further options were available to extend the gear, the pilot executed an emergency landing.  The airplane touched down on the left main wheel which did not collapse initially.  The right wing subsequently dropped and contacted the runway.  The pilot applied left wheel brakes, however, the airplane departed the right side of the runway pavement and came to rest in the grass. The left main landing gear collapsed and a runway light was damaged in the process.  The post-accident inspection revealed that a hydraulic powerpak drain line (Piper part number 46138-00) was ruptured.  The drain line was located in the nose section of the airplane, forward of the cabin pressure bulkhead.  The rupture was approximately one-half inch long.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft incident report.The Boeing 757-200 airplane experienced a fire in the cockpit shortly after the airplane had leveled off at its cruise altitude of 36,000 feet.  As a result of the immediate actions of the flight crew, the fire was extinguished.  As the airplane descended through about 500 feet, the inner pane of the captain\u2019s windshield cracked.  Because he could not see clearly out of his shattered windshield, the captain transferred control of the airplane to the first officer, who was able to land the airplane without incident.Post incident examination of the airplane revealed the J5 terminal block on the captain\u2019s side windshield had ignited and was mostly consumed by fire.  The J5 terminal connector lug was found secured to the terminal block with only a screw; no lock washer was present. Examinations revealed that none of the other terminal block installations on the captain\u2019s and first officer\u2019s windshields contained a lock washer.Further examination of the J5 terminal block did not find any evidence of a condition that would result in the terminal block overheating (such as a misthreaded screw or damaged wiring).  It is likely that the connection between the connector lug and the terminal block was loose because of the missing lock washer.  A loose connection can create a point of high resistance in the electrical path between the terminal lug and terminal block, which can generate temperatures high enough to cause the terminal block to ignite.A review of United Airlines\u2019 maintenance records found that the captain\u2019s No. 1 windshield was installed on January 29, 2007, in accordance with the United Airlines 757 Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM).  A review of the AMM found that it was consistent with Boeing\u2019s AMM and that both AMMs lacked information to alert the maintenance technician that a lock washer must be installed at all power and sensor terminal block installations.  After the May 16, 2010 incident, Boeing released a temporary revision (TR56-1004) to AMM 56-11-01/401 which adds specific instructions for the installation of the lock washer and graphics depicting its installation.  United has revised their AMM per the changes identified in the temporary revision.A review of the airplane\u2019s service history revealed that evidence indicating that an electrical anomaly had recently occurred in the cockpit were clearly available to United Airlines maintenance personnel a day before the incident flight.  Specifically, there were reports of electrical odors in the cockpit on two of the three flights before the incident flight.  On the flight immediately before the incident flight, the captain reported to maintenance that his No. 1 windshield lower outboard power connector appeared burnt and was hot to the touch.  At the time of the maintenance inspection, the lead mechanic thought that the power terminal block was a part of the bus bar.  He referred to the United Airlines AMM, which indicated that the window should be replaced due to the discoloration of the bus bar; however, the limitations section of the manual stated that the item could be deferred for 50 flight hours.  After discussing this with another mechanic, they decided to defer the maintenance write-up for 50 flight hours.  This deferral option was not found in the Boeing AMM.  This lack of clarity may have caused inadequate troubleshooting to be performed as well as the deferral of a failing component that subsequently resulted in a fire.  United Airlines has modified its AMM to enhance the troubleshooting procedures and remove the 50 hour deferral.United Airlines\u2019 maintenance organization was aware of Boeing Service Bulletins (SB) 757-30-0019, revision 2, dated April 19, 2010, which provides instructions for initial and repeat inspections of the terminal blocks.  However, at the time of the incident, United Airlines had not yet performed the actions specified in the SB on the incident airplane, nor were they required to do so by the FAA.  If the actions specified in SB 757-30-0019 had been performed, it is likely that an anomaly would have been discovered at the J5 terminal block and the fire prevented.",
            "probable_cause": "The ignition of the J5 power terminal located on the captain\u2019s No. 1 windshield due to a loose electrical connection between the terminal connector lug and its respective terminal block. The loose connection resulted from a missing lock washer that allowed the resistance in the electrical path to increase sufficiently to generate high enough temperatures to ignite the terminal block.Contributing to the probable cause was the lack of instructions to ensure the lock washer was installed in the J5 power terminal block in the Boeing 757 aircraft maintenance manual (AMM). Additionally, contributing to the incident was the deferral of the related maintenance write-up before the incident, which resulted from information in the United Airlines AMM that stated, \u201cWhen bus bar(s) show signs of blackening or burning, the condition is acceptable for continued service, although the window must be replaced within 50 flight-hours."

He switched the seat belt sign on that had been off, and advised the flight attendant of the potential for adverse weather for the destination area.  At the same time, air traffic control (ATC) advised the flightcrew of amending their arrival to the destination airport.  The ride conditions was requested from the controller who informed the flightcrew that an occasional light chop had been encountered at all altitudes, but no moderate turbulence had been reported.  The captain continued advising the flight attendant via crew interphone, and about 2 minutes after the seat belt sign had been illuminated, the flight encountered moderate turbulence which lasted approximately 15-20 seconds and was not depicted on the weather radar display.  The flight attendant hung up the interphone to check on the passengers, while the first officer advised ATC of the encounter.  Approximately 3 minutes after the weather encounter, the flight attendant advised him that a passenger had been hurt.  A medical emergency was declared and the flight proceeded to Orlando where an uneventful landing occurred.  The flight attendant stated that during level cruise flight with the seatbelt sign off, the passenger who would become injured and her daughter got up to use the lavatory.  The seatbelt sign then came on and the captain advised her on the interphone about the landing and the fact that the airplane was being rerouted.  The seatbelt sign had been on for at least 2 minutes when the flight encountered turbulence.  She hung up the phone and sat down until it was safe to get up then went to assess the situation.  She and the passengers' daughter tried to get the lavatory door open and she then advised the captain of the situation.  The lavatory door was then opened and another passenger assisted the injured passenger to seat 18B.

The airframe and powerplant (A&P;) with an inspection authorization (IA) rated mechanic reported that he signed off the logbooks with the expectation that another mechanic would perform an engine run-up prior to flight. Federal Aviation regulations did not allow delegation of authority with regards to the inspection and that the IA must perform the inspection prior to approving the airplane for return to service. The accident pilot arrived to the maintenance facility prior to the A&P; mechanic, retrieved the logbooks that were signed off, and departed. Oil was noticed on the taxiway that services the maintenance facility, in the engine run-up area, and leading to the runway. The oil cooler return line attach nipple was fractured and gouges were noted on the surface of the hose end socket caused by an inadvertent contact by a wrench slipping off of a nearby bolt or nut and striking the surface of the hose end socket.

About 500 feet mean sea level (msl), she noticed a hesitation in the engine and decided to make a 180-degree turn back to the runway.  The airplane was still high on the approach, so the pilot reduced the airspeed, performed S-turns, and then slipped the airplane to lose altitude.  She was still high, and about halfway down the runway, she further reduced the airspeed, which increased the sink rate.  She lowered the nose to slow the sink rate, and was in the process of raising the nose again to flare for landing when the nose struck the runway.

At the time of the incident, both aircraft were on regularly scheduled 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 passenger flights and operating in full compliance with air traffic control clearances issued by the Federal Aviation Administration's Honolulu Control Facility (HCF). There was no damage reported to either aircraft, or any injuries to passengers or crew.Because of traffic conditions in oceanic airspace, Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center Oceanic Control requested approval from HCF to allow the B752 to enter HCF airspace on R578 at flight level 330, an inappropriate altitude for the direction of flight. HCF approved the request. When the B752 reported 9 miles northeast of FAPIS waypoint on R578, the HCF radar controller issued a transponder code to the pilot. The B752 flew about 35 nautical miles southwest on R578 before the aircraft was detected by radar and appeared on the HCF controller's display. At that time, the B753 was northeast-bound at flight level 330, also on R578, opposite direction to the B752 and in radar contact with HCF. When the B753 was about 5.3 nautical miles from the B752, the pilot of the B753 reported that they had received a resolution advisory from their on-board anti-collision system and executed an emergency descent. The B752 reported that they had also responded to a resolution advisory and climbed. According to FAA separation standards, the two aircraft should have been at different altitudes 10 minutes before they passed.

The pilot was able to return the airplane to level flight, but it rocked left and right, with the left aileron going up and down from stop to stop. The pilot chose to perform an emergency landing in a field next to an airport. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the two aileron push-pull rod bolts were missing. The bolts and associated hardware were not located among the wreckage. The airplane had undergone extensive maintenance about 5 months before the accident. A review of the airplane's maintenance manual revealed that the nuts installed in the airplane control system are self-locking nuts, which can loosen if insufficient torque is applied to them. It is likely that maintenance personnel applied improper torque to the aileron's push-pull rod self-locking nuts, which resulted in the eventual loosening of the nuts and the separation of the left aileron's push-pull rod and hardware.",

The two pilots were brothers and both were retired airline pilots. The left seat pilot owned a share in the airplane and had logged 50 hours in make/model. The right seat pilot had flown light aircraft previously, but had never flown the Beech S35. Wreckage examination disclosed the landing gear was up and the flaps were fully deployed. The throttle, mixture, and propeller controls were full forward. The throwover control wheel was in the right position. According to pilots familiar with the S35 Bonanza, it has conventional flight and stall characteristics in uncoordinated flight or in a cross-controlled stall. Chapter 5-2 of FAA's 'Airplane Flying Handbook' (FAA-H-8033-3) states: 'In a cross-control stall, the airplane often stalls with little warning. The nose may pitch down, the inside wing may suddenly drop, and the airplane may continue to roll to an inverted position. This is usually the beginning of a spin. It is obvious that close to the ground is no place to allow this to happen. Recovery must be made before the airplane enters an abnormal attitude (vertical spiral or spin); it is a simple matter to return to straight-and-level flight by coordinated use of the controls. The pilot must be able to recognize when this stall is imminent and must take immediate action to prevent a completely stalled condition. It is imperative that this type of stall not occur during an actual approach to a landing, since recovery may be impossible prior to ground contact due to the low altitude.' ",

The weather conditions at the airport included overcast skies at 400 feet, and a visibility of 2 miles in mist.  About 2 minutes after departure, the accident pilot requested to return to the seaplane base, stating in part, \"it's really thick out here.\"  No further communication was received from the pilot.  The pilot of the first Piper airplane to depart also decided to return, and spotted the tail of the accident Piper protruding from the water about mid-channel of the inlet.  The first Piper pilot notified air traffic control (ATC) of the situation, and then landed on the water to render any assistance.  The first Piper was not equipped with any position locating equipment, consequently, the accident location was an estimate by the pilot.  The accident Piper sank within about 2 minutes, and no survivor was observed.  The accident pilot and the airplane have not been found.  A witness located on the shore of the inlet saw the accident Piper appear from the base of a fog bank that was over the inlet.  The airplane descended out of the fog about 100 feet above the water in a left bank of about 45 degrees, and about 20 degrees nose down.  The airplane descended until it collided with the water about mid-channel, impacting the water with the left wing first, and immediately began to sink.  Water search efforts were initiated that involved the use of a 2-crew hovercraft, a Coast Guard rigid-hull inflatable boat (RIB), a fire department rescue RIB, a commercial tug, and a volunteer underwater mapping vessel.  The use of helicopters was unsuccessful because of low ceilings and low visibility.

The temperature and dew point at the nearest reporting point about 6 nautical miles from the accident site near the time of the accident were recorded as 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 55 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively. Plotting these values on a carburetor icing probability chart indicated that the airplane was operating in the range for serious icing at glide power.

Each wing tank holds 20 usable gallons; total fuel capacity 40 gallons. The pilot this was the first flight in this aircraft, and her first solo banner tow flight. Her prior flight experience was gained primarily in a Cessna 210 and North American T-28. The pilot reported that she had returned to the airport after a 3-hour mission and entered the traffic pattern to drop the banner. The engine quit on downwind. The pilot dropped the banner and attempted to make the runway, but landed about 30 feet short in the dirt and nosed over in soft soil. The pilot stated that following the engine failure she lowered full flaps.  The pilot reported that she had been feeding off the right tank during the last 40 minutes or so of the flight and may have forgotten to reposition the selector to the both position before entering the traffic pattern and inadvertently ran one tank dry. The pilot noted that this aircraft has a fuel system significantly different from the other banner towing aircraft in the operator's fleet that she flew in during the dual banner towing training flights. She said she repeatedly asked the operator for a manual on the aircraft to learn the system differences but was told that one was not available. An FAA inspector examined the aircraft and found no fuel in the right tank and about 13 gallons in the left.

The airplane touched down about 6 ft right of the runway centerline. Shortly after touchdown, the nosewheel began to shimmy violently. The pilot applied maximum braking to both pedals simultaneously to reduce the speed as he applied back stick pressure, but the nosewheel continued to shimmy. The nosewheel fork then failed, and the nose landing gear dug into the runway, which caused the airplane to veer off the right side of the runway. The nose landing gear collapsed in the soft ground, and the airplane subsequently nosed over. The postaccident examination of the nose landing gear, shimmy damper, and nosewheel revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.The examination of the runway revealed a skid mark produced by the nosewheel tire, which indicated that the tire skidded back and forth while the airplane's direction continued straight down the runway. According to Federal Aviation Administration guidance, wheelbarrowing occurs when a pilot permits the airplane weight to become concentrated about the nosewheel during takeoff or landing, which can cause of a loss of directional control. One of the most common causes of wheelbarrowing during the landing roll is the simultaneous touchdown of the main wheels and nosewheel with excessive speed. The guidance states that \u201cheavy braking should be avoided until the wings are devoid of lift and the airplane\u2019s full weight is resting on the landing gear,\u201d which is contrary to the pilot\u2019s actions. The circumstances of the accident were consistent with the airplane wheelbarrowing during the landing.",

The airplane was in instrument meteorological conditions, and when he saw a clearing in the clouds, the pilot made a \u201cstandard rate\u201d spiral down through it. After exiting the clouds, he found a suitable place to land. On the approach, about 300 feet above ground level, the airplane started to porpoise. The pilot attempted to correct the porpoise, but the nose of the airplane struck the top of a tree before impacting the ground.Postaccident examination of the airplane\u2019s flight controls did not reveal any mechanical anomalies. The engine examination revealed that incorrect pistons were installed at the time the engine was overhauled about 350 hours before the accident, but this did not play a role in the accident. The airplane was equipped with a dual alternator system. A postaccident interview with the pilot revealed that he attempted to energize the alternator\u2019s field utilizing the pilot operating handbook procedure for a single alternator system. The dual alternator system emergency procedure was a supplement for the pilot operating handbook, and the checklist that was located in the airplane did not contain the normal or emergency procedures that were required for the dual alternator system. The emergency procedure for the dual system stated to depress the ALT RESTART switch, located next to the circuit breaker panel; the pilot stated that he did not know about the ALT RESTART switch. The No. 1 alternator was tested and examined. The No. 1 alternator functioned for 5 minutes during the test before it stopped producing power. It showed signs of excessive heat consistent with overloading when examined internally. The No. 2 alternator was not tested due to accident damage. The internal examination revealed burnt windings.The onboard engine data monitoring system indicated that the battery voltage decreased rapidly just prior to the loss of electrical power. A postaccident examination of the airplane\u2019s electrical system revealed that the alternator restart battery pack did not contain enough voltage to reenergize the alternator field in the event that an alternator failed. A functional test of the system was required every 25 hours to ensure it worked correctly. The batteries were required as per the Airplane Service Manual to be replaced annually or sooner if the alternators cannot be restarted under a heavy load electrical load. A review of the airplane\u2019s maintenance records revealed that most recent documentation for the alternator restart system batteries change was about 12 years ago.It is likely that the No. 2 alternator failed at an unknown time, which resulted in the entire electrical system on the airplane feeding off of the No. 1 alternator. The No. 1 alternator subsequently overloaded and failed, and the airplane\u2019s battery was unable to sustain the electrical system demand.

The pilot's husband, who was a commercial pilot and former naval aviator, reported that he witnessed the accident flight, which consisted of two landings. He stated that the first landing appeared to be fairly flat, consistent with an insufficient landing flare upon touchdown. After landing, the pilot taxied the airplane to the approach end of the runway for the next takeoff. On the second landing, the airplane again appeared to have a flat pitch attitude upon touchdown. The airplane bounced, which was followed by an audible increase in engine power. The airplane then entered a nose-high pitch attitude as it began a slow climb. The airplane climbed about 100 feet above the runway before the pilot\u2019s husband heard another increase in engine power and observed the airplane enter a descending left turn. The airplane still had a nose-high pitch attitude and was in a 60-degree left bank when he lost visual contact with the airplane as it descended toward hangars located on the northeast side of the airport. Two additional witnesses provided similar statements about the airplane's pitch attitude, engine operation, and flightpath following the bounce and subsequent aborted landing. These witnesses also reported seeing the airplane enter a nose-low, left spin shortly before it collided with the hangars. The postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

The pilot radioed air traffic control personnel that the engine was losing power and would not sustain flight.  He was attempting to make it to an airport when the airplane impacted trees in mountainous terrain.  An airframe inspection was conducted with no discrepancies noted that would have precluded normal operation.  The engine was equipped with a single-drive dual magneto that remained secure at its mounting pad.  During manual rotation of the crankshaft, investigators could hear the \"snapping\" of the coupling, but no spark was observed at any of the leads.  Magneto-to-engine timing could not be established because the contacts were not breaking electrical continuity.  A functional check by the magneto manufacturer revealed that both magneto primary circuits had short-circuited to ground in all magnet positions, which was consistent with the breaker points not opening.  Disassembly revealed that the plastic cam followers were melted and smeared in the direction of normal cam rotation.  The breaker cams, made of sintered iron material, are supposed to be impregnated with oil per the service manual or production instructions for lubrication purposes at each overhaul.

In accordance with the Service Support Manual instructions for the magneto, during this process the breaker cams and contact points should be inspected for lubrication, wear, burning, or melting.  The on-scene examination revealed that the pilot was not wearing his shoulder harness, which remained stowed in the stowage sheath above the pilot's cabin door.

A loud noise and smoke followed as the airplane slid down the runway. The data retrieved from the DFDR indicated that the airplane was descending through an indicated altitude of 1,450 feet, on an indicated heading of 226 degree, and an indicated airspeed of 146 knots. The airplanes heading changed to 135 degree as the airplane descended through 225 feet, and the indicated airspeed read 95 knots. As the airplane descended, the indicated airspeed was between 95 to 90 knots for about 15 seconds. The last five seconds of the flight, the indicated airspeed decreased to 83 knots. The last recorded data on the DFDR read that the airplane was on an indicated heading of 137 degree, indicated airspeed of 83 knots, and recorded a vertical acceleration of 4 g. At the time of the accident the airplane had several interior items removed. The weight and balance calculation sheet for that flight was not submitted for the investigation by the operator of the airplane. The pilot stated the airplane had 3,600 pounds of fuel on board at time of departure. Reference to Cessna's Section IV-Performance Standard Charts for stall speeds for the model 550, with full flaps and landing gear extended, a non-banked stall speed at 12,000 pounds gross weight is 80 knots calibrated airspeed.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in a stall and undershoot of the runway."
