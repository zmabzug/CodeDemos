According to the G36 Pilot Operating Handbook, the engine\u2019s electric boost pump provides pressure for starting and emergency operation only. The handbook cautions that use of the electric boost pump during normal operations can result in an overly rich fuel/air mixture, possibly flooding the engine. If either pilot inadvertently activated the fuel boost pump while attempting to retract the landing gear during the go-around, it could have resulted in a temporarily rich fuel/air mixture, reducing the available engine power and possibly distracting the pilots during the go-around. Although, the examination revealed that the electric fuel boost pump system switch was in the \u201cOFF\u201d position and that the pump was not operating at the time of impact, it is possible that the pilots recognized that the electric fuel boost pump system was on during the go-around and switched it off before the crash. The position of the switch and the reduced engine power likely distracted the pilot, who did not maintain adequate airspeed during the go-around, which resulted in a loss of control.",

During descent, the right alternator failed, and the owner performed the emergency gear extension procedure.  Following an emergency gear extension, the landing gear of this model airplane cannot be retracted until the system has been ground serviced.  A mechanic reported that about 7 months prior to the accident, with the owner present, he removed the oil filter from the left engine, found it packed with metal shavings and told the owner that the engine needed overhaul.  Two other mechanics reported that approximately three weeks before the accident, they installed an oil filter on the left engine, changed the oil, and cleaned the oil pressure regulator.  They ground ran both engines with no discrepancies noted.  One of the mechanics reported that following the engine run, the left engine oil filter was removed, examined, and no metal was found.  The landing gear was not serviced.  According to the owner, the pilot was \"hired\" by one of the two mechanics to ferry the airplane with the gear extended to a location where the gear could be serviced.  While en route, the pilot reported a loss of power on the left engine, that he was having trouble feathering the engine, that the airplane would not maintain altitude and he was looking for a place to land.  Witnesses observed the airplane flying low, wheels down and losing altitude.  They further observed it roll into a steep left bank, hit trees and a fence, catch fire, come to rest inverted on a road and burn.  Post accident examination of the left engine revealed a hole in the right crankcase half over the #3 cylinder attach point.  Disassembly of the left engine revealed that the #3 connecting rod was separated from the crankshaft, and the rod bolts, rod cap, and top of the rod were deformed.  The #5 piston pin had one cap missing.  Scoring was noted on the crankshaft journals, and the main bearings exhibited discoloration and deformation consistent with oil starvation.  The cylinders exhibited deformation, scoring in the barrels, and deposits on the domes.  The camshaft exhibited discoloration and scoring on the camshaft lobes.  Disassembly of the left propeller revealed that it was in the vicinity of low pitch/latch position and not rotating at impact.  The disassembly of the right engine and propeller did not reveal any discrepancies that would have precluded operation prior to impact.

Approximately 8 minutes into the flight, about 350-400 feet above the Hudson River while on an approach to land, a 20-inch section of the composite main rotor blade trailing portion, aft of the spar, fractured from the rest of the blade. The pilot reported an immediate decay in main rotor speed with a prominent and abnormal vibration. She also saw a piece of debris, most likely the liberated piece from the main rotor blade, fly from the left rear of the helicopter forward, past the cabin. She made an emergency autorotation onto the water after activating the emergency float system. The helicopter landed upright on its floats; however, the main rotor blades struck the water and the tail boom, resulting in substantial damage to the tail boom. The occupants were rescued by boaters and were not injured. Detailed examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of flight control system component failures or malfunctions other than the main rotor blade fracture.The main rotor blades (part number 355A-11-0030) were manufactured from glass fiber reinforced composite material with a foam core. From the leading edge to trailing edge of the blade, the blade is constructed with a spar, wedge-shaped foam core, trailing edge roving, and trailing edge tab sandwiched between skin layers and skin reinforcement layers. The skin, skin reinforcement, and trailing edge tab layers are made with glass fabric reinforcement. The trailing edge roving is made of unidirectional glass fibers aligned approximately parallel with the spanwise direction of the blade.The main rotor blade that fractured was examined at the manufacturer\u2019s facility with oversight by France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA), and results of the examination were reviewed by the NTSB Materials Laboratory. The National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory also examined sectioned pieces of the blue and yellow main rotor blades submitted by Eurocopter. Physical and microscopic examination of the main rotor blade showed that the fracture was due to fatigue cracks that initiated near the trailing edge of the blade near blade station 1300. It was discovered that the fatigue cracking most likely occurred due to out-of-specification deviations in the alignment of the trailing edge roving fibers within a transition region where the trailing edge roving shifts toward the trailing edge and where skin reinforcement layers end.In the areas of the deviations, the unidirectional fibers of the roving were not properly aligned with the spanwise direction of the blade, likely resulting in localized changes in stiffness at the trailing edge. With this type of fiber misalignment, some of the longitudinal stresses normally carried by the roving layers would be shed to adjacent skin and trailing edge tab areas, which can result in fatigue cracking in these adjacent layers. The undamaged fracture features in the trailing edge roving of the blue main rotor blade section revealed fiber fractures with mirror fracture surfaces across the fiber diameters indicating they were substantially weakened when they fractured. The mirror fractures in the fibers could be evidence of progressive fracture through the trailing edge roving due to fatigue or environmental attack.The fracture surface overall was relatively rough and did not form a flat plane typical of fatigue fracture in tension, such as observed in some areas of the skin. However, some of the fibers had a step at one side or both sides of the fracture that could suggest a mixed mode of loading including tension and transverse shear, which could theoretically explain the overall roughness of the fractures. Also, as cracking progresses the matrix material surrounding the fibers will crack, allowing environmental exposure that could potentially weaken the fibers. The fractographic evidence indicates the trailing edge roving was likely significantly weaker than expected. The weakening of the trailing edge roving fibers could occur due to mechanical damage to the surfaces of the fiber during the fatigue cracking process or could be due to an environmental attack of the fibers as cracking progressed. In either case, the strength of individual fibers was less than expected in a large area of the trailing edge roving.The total extent to which the trailing edge roving was weakened is unknown due to post-fracture damage and the unknown extent to which the trailing edge roving might have cracked before final fracture. In previous cases of skin cracking, an intact trailing edge roving was required to maintain crack stability. In this case however, the evidence shows the trailing edge roving was likely significantly weaker than expected. The previous cases cannot be used as evidence for crack stability in this case due to the weakened condition of the trailing edge roving. Given the extent of cracking in the skin and evidence of weakening in the trailing edge roving, it is likely that the cracking at the trailing edge of the blue blade had proceeded to an extent to cause fracture of the blade.The deviation in the trailing edge roving fibers occurred during the manufacture of the accident blade and it is likely that the trailing edge fibers shifted during the curing process. The skin layers of the blades are somewhat translucent after curing, and manufacturing records showed that the inspector who performed the visual examination after curing flagged the transition area of this blade for a radiographic inspection. It is possible that the inspector observed an anomaly in the trailing edge roving; however, the out-of-specification deviations in the trailing edge roving were not detected by the radiographic examination.A record search by the blade manufacturer of 9,761 similar blades revealed that one other blade had been flagged for radiographic inspection near blade station 1300 during visual examination and subsequently passed radiographic inspection. That blade was returned to the manufacturer\u2019s facility and examined. The blade was sectioned, and the trailing edge roving showed no significant deviations from the as-designed position. The two other blades from the accident helicopter were also examined at the manufacturer. The trailing edge roving in these blades did not show any significant deviations from the as-designed position.The main rotor blade was rated for a service life of 20,000 hours and the fracture/separation occurred after about 8,077 hours. The manufacturer stated that prior to this event there had been no reported similar main rotor blade failures.",
            "probable_cause": "The fatigue fracture and in-flight separation of a 20-inch section of the blue composite main rotor blade trailing edge, aft of the spar, due to inadequate manufacture, and the manufacturer\u2019s subsequent failure to detect an out-of-specification deviation in the rotor blade\u2019s trailing edge roving."

Earlier in the day, the weather in the area was not suitable for flight operations, but the pilot, along with another company pilot, performed the company risk assessment and decided that, under the current conditions, flights could depart. The pilot reported that the first two legs were uneventful. However, he noted that, upon landing at the end of the second leg, about 3 inches of slush covered the runway, with as much as 6 inches in some areas, and that the wind was from the east at 12 to 15 knots. After loading passengers, the pilot decided to taxi from the north parking ramp to the opposite end of the runway for a northerly departure. The pilot and witnesses stated that the airplane\u2019s takeoff performance was degraded due to the runway contamination, but the airplane was still able to lift off just past the midfield point. The pilot stated that after the airplane lifted off in a nose-high attitude, he immediately started a shallow left turn to avoid the rising terrain at the north end of the runway. He said that after the airplane cleared a retaining wall on the west side of the runway, it encountered a downdraft, and the pilot was unable to maintain a climb. The airplane impacted the ocean about 100 yards offshore. There is no official weather reporting at the airport. About 35 minutes before the accident, the nearest official weather reporting station, located 9 nautical miles northeast of the airport, reported wind from 170 degrees at 3 knots. About 10 minutes after the accident, it reported wind from 170 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 15 knots. The airport is tightly constrained on both sides by terrain and water, and the runway condition is difficult to maintain due to sea erosion and lack of suitable maintenance equipment. According to the airport manager, there is a contract maintenance provider in the village, and, on the morning of the accident, it was determined that runway conditions did not require maintenance. The contractor stated that the weather was very dynamic that day; he asked the pilot of the first airplane that landed if any maintenance was required on the runway and was told that the runway was fine. However, given the contamination on the runway, the accident pilot likely lifted off farther down the runway than normal. The airplane\u2019s attitude and slow airspeed, combined with the unfavorable wind conditions he encountered after he executed the shallow turn, likely resulted in an aerodynamic stall.A review of the operator\u2019s flight risk assessment form showed that, for the conditions during the accident flight, the pilot and another company pilot should have assigned three of the five risk areas a value that requires additional management approval before flights could be released. Instead, they agreed that conditions were appropriate for flight and were allowed to exercise operational control to release the flights for departure, which placed the flight at risk for an accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s decision to takeoff from a contaminated runway with unfavorable wind conditions, and his failure to maintain airspeed during the initial climb, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the operator\u2019s inadequate procedures for operational control and dispatch."

Once the weather conditions improved, the pilot departed and proceeded to the first destination where he landed uneventfully; at that time, the pilot had been on duty for about 14 hours. After landing, the pilot did not call the company's director of operations as he was reportedly instructed to do when the flight was dispatched. One witness at the airport reported that the pilot seemed anxious, which the individual  attributed to his being late and not because of the weather.The pilot obtained weather information for the second destination from a friend (who was a flight instructor) and subsequently departed on the visual flight rules (VFR) flight to his second destination. At the time of departure, the destination forecast was a ceiling of 1,500 ft and visibility of 6 miles. After establishing contact with the approach controller, the pilot was informed that the airport was operating under instrument flight rules (IFR). The controller asked the pilot his intention, and the pilot replied that he wanted an IFR clearance. The pilot confirmed with the controller that he was capable and qualified for IFR flight and was provided an IFR clearance.The pilot was instructed to turn right to intercept the localizer at a 30-degree angle and was cleared for the instrument landing system runway 24 approach. (Postaccident examination confirmed that one navigation receiver was set to that approach.) The airplane then banked left, and, during portions of the turn, the bank rate was three times greater than a standard banked turn, and the pilot began flying in an east-northeasterly direction while descending. The bank angle reduced and was changing at the end of the radar data. About 2 seconds after the last radar return, the pilot stated, \"say again for two echo Juliet.\" This response likely indicated that he was not prepared for the approach clearance instructions or was distracted by cockpit duties. The controller immediately instructed the pilot to level the wings and climb, but there was no reply.A performance study indicated that the airplane made a left bank of about 60 degrees (a rate of turn of about 11 degrees per second) during the last seconds of flight before it crashed about 0.3 mile from the last radar target. The airplane was fragmented after impacting trees and terrain on a magnetic heading of about 284 degrees. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the flaps and landing gear were retracted, and there was no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction of the airframe, flight controls, or engine. There were no reported issues with the localizer at the airport following the accident.Although one witness reported hearing a sputtering sound coming from the engine likely about the time that the flight was being vectored by the air traffic controller on the downwind leg, the pilot did not advise the controller of any problems during that or any subsequent portion of the flight. Additionally, a witness who was located less than 1/2 nautical mile from the accident site reported that the engine sound was steady. Further, a cut portion of tree made by the propeller was consistent with the engine developing power.Although windshear advisories were in effect and windshear was reported from a flight crew about 29 minutes after the accident, the wind encountered by the airplane at the time of the accident likely would not have caused the pilot to turn in a direction opposite that instructed by the controller. The pilot was reportedly in good health, and his communications with the controller indicated that he likely was not impaired at the time of the accident.Although the autopilot programmer/computer was too badly damaged to functionally test, the steeply banked turn opposite that instructed by the air traffic controller was likely the result of pilot input and not the result of an autopilot malfunction. The roll servo was tested, and the lowest reported override force was slightly less than the lowest limit. Thus, if the autopilot had commanded greater than 90 percent of a standard-rate turn, the pilot would have been able to easily override the roll servo.It could not be determined if the engine-driven vacuum pump was operating or the standby vacuum system was engaged; however, the electrically driven instruments, such as the turn coordinator, and flight instruments consisting of the airspeed indicator, altimeter, and vertical speed indicator would have provided the pilot with roll and pitch information.Although the pilot was instrument-rated and had recently passed his instrument proficiency check, he was only qualified to fly VFR in revenue operations. He was also not current to fly at night, which was unknown to company personnel at the time of dispatch. In addition, although the flights could have been completed within the pilot's duty day if there were no delays, company personnel should have recognized that weather was causing delays and that the pilot was continuing to fly beyond his duty day. Thus, the company's dispatch procedures were lacking in that they allowed the pilot to fly in night, instrument meteorological conditions beyond his duty day, and company personnel were seemingly unaware that he initiated the flight and was not current to fly at night.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane while being vectored to intercept the localizer during night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Contributing to the accident was the operator's inadequate dispatch procedures, which did not prevent the pilot from flying beyond his duty day, flying at night for which he was not current, or flying in IMC for which he was not qualified by the company."

He and the other balloon pilots flying that day compared the weather information and agreed that the forecast weather provided suitable conditions for a safe flight that morning. However, because the wind conditions on the ground were light and erratic, they delayed taking off. The pilots continued monitoring the current and forecast weather using their wireless devices. The wind eventually calmed, and, after putting up additional pibals, they determined that the wind at altitude would take the balloons to the east-southeast and then south at 3 to 5 miles per hour. At takeoff, the wind was calm. The balloon traveled to the east-southeast and then, about 1,000 to 1,200 feet above ground level, the balloon turned toward the south. The first 30 to 40 minutes of flight were smooth, and the balloon traveled slowly to the southeast. About 40 minutes into the flight, at an altitude of 6,200 feet mean sea level, a wind gust buffeted the balloon. The pilot reported the condition to the other pilots who were flying in the area, and they responded that they were experiencing similar conditions at various altitudes. As he looked at the other balloons, the pilot noticed significant distortions in the envelopes indicative of high winds. The pilot briefed his passengers on a high-wind landing and landed in a cleared construction area. As the balloon touched down, he pulled the deflation lines, and the balloon deflated in seconds; however, the envelope concaved, and the balloon was dragged for several hundred feet until it came to rest on the side of a highway. A review of meteorological data available at the time of the preflight briefing indicated, in part, that wind from the west existed at 10 knots or less before takeoff. The National Weather Service (NWS) terminal area forecast expected easterly wind shifting to the northwest at 13 knots during the anticipated flight with wind from the north gusting to 23 knots after 1000 mountain daylight time. The NWS area forecast did not expect any high winds across Colorado. The NWS Aviation Forecast Center had no advisories current for low-level turbulence or high winds over Colorado surrounding the anticipated flight. However, shortly after takeoff, a sudden increase in windspeed occurred across the region with wind gusts from 20 to 38 knots. The NWS misjudged the timing and underestimated the magnitude of the frontal boundary moving across the region. It is likely that, if the pilot had known about the gusting wind at the time of takeoff, he may not have chosen to fly that day.",

The commercial rated pilot and non-pilot rated student were fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by Hanger Aviation, Inc. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local instructional flight. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to a witness, the airplane began its takeoff roll on runway 35 with \"40 degrees of flaps.\" Multiple witnesses stated that the airplane lifted off the ground about midfield and that it \"immediately looked unstable.\" A witness added that the wings were banking to the right and left. When the airplane reached an altitude about 100 feet above ground level, it entered a continuous left turn and subsequently rolled wings level on a westerly heading. The airplane then entered a nose down attitude followed by a right wing low attitude and was in a \"straight downward dive\" when it impacted the ground. The airplane impacted a field of sparse vegetation about 1100 feet northwest of the departure end of runway 35. The airplane came to rest in a near vertical, nose-down, position and was orientated on a 310 degree heading. All major components of the aircraft were accounted for at the accident site. The initial impact point was about 3 feet forward of the main wreckage. The wings remained attached to the fuselage and exhibited leading edge crush damage that spanned the entire length of each wing. Flight control continuity was confirmed for all control surfaces from the cockpit.

The controller subsequently asked the accident pilot if he could reduce his speed,\"a little bit.\"  The accident pilot responded that he was slowing down.  Less than a minute later, the controller told the accident pilot that he was cleared to land.  The accident pilot's last radio transmission was his acknowledgement of the landing clearance.  The controller stated that he did not see the accident airplane other than on the radar scope, but did see a plume of smoke on the final approach course for the active runway.

Inspection of the flight controls and engines disclosed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical problems.  Low speed flight reduces the margin between a safe operating speed and an aerodynamic stall.  Wing \"wobble\" at low speeds is often an indicator of an incipient aerodynamic stall.

Another witness reported seeing the airplane come over the tree line behind his residence and impact the ground in a nose-low attitude.

The witness observations are consistent with the pilot attempting to climb at too steep a pitch angle, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.

Another witness reported that the pilot then assisted the passenger and the lapchild into the front seat of the glider and ensured that the restraints were properly latched and snug. The pilot then got in the rear seat, and he secured his own lap belt and shoulder straps. Several witnesses noticed that, after takeoff, the tail dolly was still attached to the glider, and the glider operations dispatcher made a radio call to \u201cabort...abort...abort.\u201d The takeoff continued, and several witnesses observed both the tow plane and the glider lift off normally. When the tow plane was about 50 feet above ground level (agl), the glider suddenly pitched nose up about 45 degrees, and the tow plane disconnected from the glider and turned left. The glider subsequently turned right and continued to climb steeply until it was about 150 to 200 feet agl. The glider then began what appeared to be a controlled left turn with the nose level. While the glider was turning, witnesses saw it suddenly pitch nose down and descend. Wreckage evidence showed that the glider impacted terrain at a 30- to 45-degree nose-down angle. The glider\u2019s rapid, near-vertical descent is consistent with the pilot\u2019s loss of control of the glider because of an aerodynamic stall. An on-scene examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.Two other pilots reported that they had previously inadvertently made takeoffs in the same model glider with the tail dolly still attached. Both of them reported that the flight characteristics did not change in that condition. A postaccident weight and balance calculation showed that the glider\u2019s weight and balance were still within the allowable range with the addition of the tail dolly.At the time of the accident, the pilot had cardiac hypertrophy and severe coronary artery disease. His physician had examined him 3 days before the accident and had ordered several tests. It is likely that, if the pilot had undergone a stress test, he would have failed it, and further evaluation would likely have led to a coronary artery bypass graft operation in the following few days. The pilot\u2019s wife reported that the pilot had spent the day of the accident engaging in strenuous activity, including teaching students and moving the glider around. Given the extent of coronary artery disease found on the pilot\u2019s autopsy, it is likely that the pilot\u2019s sudden awareness of the emergency situation (takeoff with the tail dolly attached) and physical exertion before the flight led to an acute coronary event and that this event contributed to his loss of control.",

The captain reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.The private weather observer on duty at the destination airport the day of accident reported that he notified the pilots via radio that he could occasionally see a cold storage camp located 1 1/4 miles away but that he did not have 1-mile visibility. He said that, the weather was \u201cbad\u201d and that, at times, he could not see the runway. He said that he instructed the pilots to use their own judgment. Based on reported weather observations, at the time of the accident, the visibility had deteriorated to 1/2 mile in heavy blowing snow. Therefore, it is likely that the flight crew lost sight of the runway during the visual approach, which resulted in the airplane touching down short of the runway.According to the company\u2019s General Operations Manual (GOM), operational control was held by the flight coordinator for the accident flight, and the flight coordinator and pilot-in-command (PIC) were jointly responsible for preflight planning, flight delay, and release of the flight, which included the risk assessment process. The flight coordinator who had operational control of the flight and released it the day of the accident had not completed flight coordinator training, which was required per the company\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved operations training manual. She assigned the flight a risk level of 2 (on a scale of 1 to 4), which, according to company risk assessment and operational control procedures, required a discussion between the PIC and flight coordinator about the risks involved. However, the flight coordinator did not discuss with the flight crew the risks and weather conditions associated with the flight.\u00a0At the time of the accident, no signoff was required for flight coordinators or pilots on the risk assessment form, and the form was not integrated into the company manuals.A review of FAA surveillance activities revealed that aviation safety inspectors had performed numerous operational control inspections and repeatedly noted deficiencies within the company\u2019s training, risk management, and operational control procedures. Enforcement Information System records indicated that FAA inspectors observed multiple incidences of the operator\u2019s noncompliance related to flight operations and opened investigations but that the investigations were closed after administrative action had been taken. Therefore, although FAA inspectors were providing surveillance and noting discrepancies within the company\u2019s procedures and processes, the FAA did not hold the operator sufficiently accountable for correcting the types of operational deficiencies evident in this accident, such as the operator\u2019s failure to comply with its operations specifications, operations training manual, and GOM and applicable federal regulations.",
            "probable_cause": "The captain\u2019s decision to initiate a visual flight rules approach and attempted landing into an area of instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in the airplane touching down short of the runway. Contributing to the accident was the operator\u2019s inadequate procedures for operational control and flight release and its inadequate training and oversight of operational control personnel. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s failure to hold the operator accountable for correcting known operational deficiencies and ensure compliance with its operational control procedures."

When the airplane failed to return, it was reported missing and a search was started. No emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal was received from the airplane. The Civil Air Patrol suspended its search activities after about 1 month. About 1 year later, a hiker found some of the pilot\u2019s personal effects, and an aerial search located the airplane wreckage about 0.5 mile from the personal effects. The accident occurred in remote mountainous terrain at an elevation of 10,000 feet. After the wreckage was discovered, a review of radar data from September 3, 2007, revealed a track that ended about 1 mile northwest of the accident site. This 20-minute track showed the airplane flying south along the crest of a mountain range with elevations greater than 13,000 feet.During the search efforts, aircraft had flown over the accident location but did not see the wreckage. Additionally, the 20-minute track had been ruled out as the accident flight due to a witness report of seeing the airplane near Yerington at the time of the track. The witness reported the time of his sighting based on a telephone call with a friend. The search team initially used the time provided by the witness. Later, it was determined from the telephone company\u2019s time log that the witness-reported time was off by 1 hour.Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane was on a northerly heading at impact, indicating that the pilot had executed a 180-degree turn after radar contact was lost. Ground scars and distribution of the heavily fragmented wreckage indicated that the airplane was traveling at a high speed when it impacted in a right wing low, near level pitch attitude. A postimpact fire consumed the fuselage, with the exception of its steel frame. The wings were fragmented into numerous pieces. The ELT was destroyed. Damage signatures on the propeller blades and the engine crankshaft indicated that the engine was operating at impact. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any malfunctions or failures that would have prevented normal operation.Visual meteorological conditions existed in the accident area at the time of the accident. Mean winds at 10,000 feet were from 220 degrees at 15 to 20 knots; some gusts of 25 to 30 knots may have occurred. Moderate turbulence and downdrafts of at least 400 feet per minute probably occurred at the time and in the area of the accident. The magnitude of the downdrafts likely exceeded the climb capability of the airplane, which, at a density altitude of 13,000 feet, was about 300 feet per minute.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane. Contributing to the accident were the downdrafts, high density altitude, and mountainous terrain."

The controller advised him that he did not have radar contact and asked the pilot for his position, but the pilot did not respond.  About a minute later, the pilot of an airplane on the ground reported that he had seen the accident airplane on TCAS, and that it appeared to be on a short final for runway 32.  Shortly thereafter, the accident pilot transmitted, \"can you see the field or the runway?  i'm trying to get down.\"  The airplane flew over the airport from south to north, made a 180-degree turn, and flew over it from north to south.  The bottom of the airplane became briefly visible to a witness on the ground.

The pilot related that after a mechanic replaced the propeller governor,  the airplane's engine and governor appeared to be operating normally, so they began their flight back to the operator's base.  He said that about 10 minutes after departure, while in cruise, level flight, he noted a light sheen of oil forming on the windshield, and he elected to make a precautionary landing on a remote beach.

An engine log book notation, entered by TCM, indicated that the reason for removal was: \"...for compliance with CSB 99-3A.\"  According to a representative from TCM's in-house analytical laboratory the crankshaft was a remanufactured part that reportedly was ground undersize, and re-nitrided at TCM.   In the presence of an NTSB Investigator, the engine was disassembled.  The investigator noted a significant amount of heat discoloration, with modest circumferential scoring of two forward most  bearings, just aft of the fractured propeller shaft, indicating a localized loss of lubrication.  He added that the oil transfer collar assembly was fractured in one location.         ",
            "probable_cause": "An in-flight fracture of the engine crankshaft during descent, precipitated by restricted oil flow through an internal engine oil passage/port."

She reported that the Cessna 150 was at an altitude slightly below her airplane's altitude.  She entered a climbing right turn and, subsequently, the airplanes collided.  The Cessna 172's right main landing gear separated and its right wing and aileron were structurally damaged.

He attempted to restart the engine, which momentarily fired, but it did not stay running. The propeller, which initially was windmilling after the power loss, eventually came to a stop, and the pilot was unable to get the engine to rotate by activating the starter. He therefore made a power-off forced landing in a nearby open field, and although the flare and touchdown were uneventful, during the landing roll, the aircraft encountered a pair of eight inch high berms and nosed over onto its back. A post accident inspection of the aircraft and engine determined that the fitting that attaches the oil pressure gauge line to the engine had come loose, and oil had escaped from the area around the fitting. Further inspection revealed that the loss of oil lead to extensive thermal and mechanical damage to the primary lower end engine components, and that the engine had seized as a result of that damage.

Although the pilot could have detected the decreasing oil pressure at that time, he did not report a loss of fuel pressure and engine power to the air traffic controller until about 6 minutes later. Data also indicate that there were multiple additional indications and cues of a loss of engine oil pressure in the cockpit but that the pilot did not respond to these in a timely manner. The operations manual indicates that the pilot should land as soon as possible if the engine oil pressure drops and then to prepare for a loss of engine power and an emergency landing. The pilot\u2019s delayed recognition of the drop in engine oil pressure was likely the result of a breakdown in her instrument scan, specifically, her systems monitoring during the climb and initial cruise phases of flight, during which time, her attention was likely directed at airplane control, power management, and navigation. The reason for the loss of engine oil pressure could not be determined during postaccident examinations due to postcrash fire damage.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to detect multiple indications and cues in the cockpit of the steady loss of engine oil pressure, which resulted in a catastrophic engine failure over terrain unsuitable for landing. Also causal was the loss of internal engine lubrication for reasons that could not be determined during postaccident examinations due to postcrash fire damage."

The flight proceeded uneventfully until it was established on the VOR/DME-C approach. Radar data indicates that after turning inbound towards the VORTAC from the DME arc, the airplane began its descent from 10,600 feet to the VOR crossing altitude of 9,200 feet. Enlargement of the radar track showed the airplane correcting slightly to the left as it proceeded inbound to the VORTAC at 9,400 feet. Shortly thereafter, aircraft track and altitude deviated 0.75 miles northwest and 9,700 feet, 0.5 miles southeast and 9,600 feet, and 0.5 miles northwest and 9,400 feet before disappearing from radar. Witnesses said the weather at the time of the accident was 600 foot overcast, 1.5 miles visibility in \"misting\" rain that became \"almost slushy on the ground,\" and a temperature of 36 degrees Fahrenheit. One weather study indicated \"an icing potential greater than 50% and visible moisture\" in the accident area.

He attempted an engine restart with negative results, and made a forced landing in a field.  During landing, the airplane collided with a terrain terrace/berm and nosed over.  The airplane was recovered, and an engine run was conducted under the supervision of the FAA.  The airplane's engine controls, propeller system, battery source, and electric fuel pump were used, and an alternate fuel source was supplied to the engine. Several attempts to start the engine were unsuccessful.  An examination of the Airflow fuel injection system was found to be missing the necessary safety wire on the purge valve stop screw.  The stop screw had migrated out of the purge valve housing approximately one-eighth of an inch.  The purge valve was isolated from the fuel system by routing the fuel supply line directly to the fuel flow divider/distribution block.  The engine was started, ran at idle power, advanced to a high power setting, and shut down with the mixture control.  Examination of the airplane log books, additional documents maintained by the registered owner, and work orders from the manufacturer, revealed the purge valve and distribution block had been returned to the manufacturer as a complete assembly on two occasions by the registered owner. The purge valve and distribution block were repaired, sent back to the registered owner as a complete assembly, and installed on the airplane by the registered owner.  The manufacturer's installation and service manual states, \"Leak check all connections and plumbing before starting engine.  Lock wire all hardware.  Make sure to lock wire the stop screw.  If removal of the valve is necessary make sure to relock wire the purge valve stop screw.  Failure to do so will result in sudden stoppage of the engine if the screw backs out.\"  The registered owner stated he did not remove the safety wire from the purge valve mounting bolts or stop screw.  The manufacturer stated all components that left their shop were assembled, tested, and tested in limits, as well as lock wired.  Review of the Work Order/Job Progress Sheet used by the manufacturer during the assembly of the purge valve on December 4, 2002, revealed the relock wire had been signed off by the technician as having been completed.  The Work Order/Job Progress Sheet used by the manufacturer during the assembly of the purge valve by the technician during the last repair on January 13, 2005, was not signed off by the technician as having  been safety wired as required by the manufacturer's installation and service manual.",

The flight was being operated as Flight 202, by Sea Port Airlines, Inc., dba Wings of Alaska, as a visual flight rules (VFR) scheduled commuter flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135. The commercial pilot sustained fatal injuries, and four passengers sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions were reported at the Juneau International Airport at the time of departure. Flight 202 departed the Juneau Airport about 1308, for a scheduled 20 minute flight to Hoonah, Alaska. A company flight plan was on file and company flight following procedures were in effect.According to Juneau Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) personnel, the pilot requested and received taxi clearance to depart for the 20 minute VFR flight to Hoonah at 1306. The flight was cleared for takeoff about 2 minutes later by the ATCT specialist on duty with no reported problems. About 15 minutes later, Juneau Police dispatchers received a 911 cell phone call from a passenger on board that the airplane had crashed. About 1336, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Alaska received a 406 Mhz emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal assigned to the accident airplane. At 1421, after being notified of an overdue airplane, and after learning about reports of an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal along the accident pilot's anticipated flight route, search and rescue personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Sitka, began a search for the missing airplane. About 1650, the crew of a U.S. Coast Guard HH-60 helicopter located the airplane's wreckage in an area of mountainous, tree-covered terrain. A rescue swimmer was lowered to the accident site and discovered that one of the airplane's occupants, the pilot, died at the scene, and four others had survived the crash. The four survivors were hoisted aboard the HH-60 helicopter in two trips, and then transported to Juneau.Assisted by the crew of a United States Coast Guard HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), along with three members from Juneau Mountain Rescue, reached the accident site on the afternoon of July 18.The on-scene examination revealed that the airplane impacted at large spruce tree, at an elevation of about 1,250 feet mean sea level. After the initial impact, the airplane fuselage separated into two pieces. The forward section of the airplane, consisting of the cockpit and engine, separated just forward of the main landing gear assembly and came to rest inverted about 50 feet forward of the initial impact point. The remaining section consisting of the main cabin, wings, and empennage came to rest inverted just below the initial impact point.  The wreckage path was on approximately a 215 degree heading, and uphill (All headings/ bearings noted in this report are magnetic). The average heights of the trees surrounding the accident site were in excess of 100 feet tall.All of the airplanes major components were found at the main wreckage site.The closest official weather observation station is Juneau, which is located about 18 miles east of the accident site. On July 17, at 1253, an Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) was reporting in part: Wind, 110 degrees at 14 knots; visibility, 7 statute miles in light rain and mist; clouds and ceiling, 200 feet few, 3,500 feet overcast; temperature, 57 degrees F; dew point, 55 degrees F; altimeter, 30.24 inHg.The accident airplane was equipped with an avionics package known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), which is also known as \"Capstone.\" ADS-B technology provides pilots with situational awareness by displaying the airplane's position over terrain, while using GPS technology, coupled with an instrument panel mounted, moving map display. The ADS-B equipment installed in the accident airplane included two Chelton multifunction display (MFD) units. One MFD provides the pilot with a moving map with terrain awareness information, and the other provides primary flight display information. The two MFD units were removed from the wreckage and shipped, to the NTSB vehicle recorder laboratory, Washington, D.C.The airplane was equipped with a Continental Motors IO-520-F reciprocating engine.

The private pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, destined for Sumner County Regional Airport (M33), Gallatin, Tennessee. According to a friend of the pilot, the pilot had departed M33 earlier in the day and had flown out to his property to visit with him. The landing was uneventful, and while the pilot was there he borrowed some tools from the property owner and increased the tension on the drive belts. Later on he started the helicopter and took off and departed to the southwest. The property owner assumed at this point that the pilot was heading back to M33 but, a little while later he observed the helicopter coming toward him in a nose low attitude, at approximately 400 feet above ground level, and at a \"high rate of speed.\" The helicopter then suddenly pitched over, began to tumble, and then impacted in an inverted attitude, and a postcrash fire ensued. Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that during the impact sequence the helicopter first made ground contact with the forward portion of the cockpit. It then tumbled along the ground on an approximate magnetic heading of 030 degrees for approximately 90 feet before coming to rest on its left side. Examination of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation of the engine.Examination of the helicopter's structure and flight control system also did not reveal evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions which would have precluded normal operation of the flight control system. During the examination however, a piece of angle iron was discovered in the debris field along with numerous broken cable ties.According to the property owner, he observed that the piece of angle iron was attached to the helicopter when the pilot landed and took off from his property and advised that the pilot had attached it to the helicopter's tail boom for weight and balance purposes.Preliminary review of weight and balance data supplied by the kit manufacturer indicated that the center of gravity of the helicopter was dependent on the pilot's weight, installed position of the battery, and position and weight of any ballast installed. Preliminary calculations based on the supplied weight and balance data, weight of the pilot, and weight and position of where the angle iron was observed to have been mounted on the helicopter's tailboom, indicated that the helicopter's center of gravity was outside of the manufacturer's approved envelope. The pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. He did not possess a rotorcraft helicopter rating or an endorsement for solo flight in a helicopter. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on August 19, 2014. He reported on that date, that he had accrued approximately 1,200 total flight hours.According to FAA records, the helicopter was issued a special airworthiness certificate on October 6, 2008. According to aircraft maintenance records, the helicopter's most recent conditional inspection was completed on May 5, 2011. At the time of accident, the helicopter had accrued approximately 51 total hours of operation.",
