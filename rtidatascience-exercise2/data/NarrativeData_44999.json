The private pilot was seriously injured, and the commercial pilot-rated passenger was fatally injured.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated from Moore County Airport (SOP), Pinehurst, North Carolina. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to a friend of the pilots, the purpose of the accident flight was to reposition the airplane in order to have maintenance performed on the alternator. The accident airplane departed from SOP, and due to concerns related to the airplane's electrical system, the pilots kept the landing gear extended for the duration of the flight. The friend departed SOP a short time later in his own airplane, and arrived in the area of SCR prior to the accident airplane. The friend recalled that the airport's automated weather observation system was reporting a visibility of 7 statute miles, scattered clouds at 400 feet, and an overcast ceiling at 9,000 feet. He also reported that a \"haze\" layer was present near the north side of the airport that was not present toward the south. The friend subsequently maneuvered his airplane so that the accident airplane could enter the traffic pattern and land first.The accident airplane initially entered the traffic pattern on a downwind leg for landing on runway 22, but upon noting the haze to the north, the pilots announced that they would transition over top of the airport to a left downwind for landing on runway 4. The friend intermittently observed the accident airplane as it maneuvered, and noted that while on the downwind-to-base turn to the runway, the airplane was in close proximity to the runway, in a left bank and nose-high attitude. When he next saw the airplane, it was in a nose-down attitude, heading toward a stand of trees that bordered the runway's east side, short of the runway threshold. The friend did not observe the impact, but when he did not receive a reply to his inquiries as to their position, assumed that the airplane had crashed. He subsequently orbited the area where he last observed the airplane and located the accident site. He then landed his own airplane, contacted emergency services, and proceeded to the accident site in order to render assistance.The pilot seated in the left front seat held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land. He held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) third-class medical certificate, which was issued in June 2014. On the application for that certificate, he reported 1,430 total hours of flight experience. The pilot-rated passenger seated in the right front seat held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single and multi-engine land, and instrument airplane, as well as a flight instructor certificate with ratings for airplane single and multi-engine land, and instrument airplane. According to the friend, she was not operating in the capacity of a flight instructor on the accident flight. She held an FAA second-class medical certificate, which was issued in September 2014, and on the application for that certificate, she reported 4,900 total hours of flight experience.An FAA inspector examined the airplane at the accident site and identified the initial impact point as a tree located about 500 feet southeast of the runway 4 approach threshold, about 300 feet southeast of the extended runway centerline. The wreckage came to rest about 65 feet from the initial impact point, on a 65-degree magnetic bearing. First responders advised the inspectors of an odor of fuel at the accident site, but that there was no post-impact fire.

After the throttle position was checked, the pilot-in-command realized that there was a reduction in engine power as the engine rpm went to idle. The pilot lowered the collective to enter an autorotation descent at 60 knots.  The helicopter collided with the ground in a marshy area with a tail low attitude.  The engine continued to run at idle power until the crew shut down the engine using the throttle and fuel valve handle.  The pilot did not report any mechanical malfunctions with the helicopter prior to the accident.  Examination of accident site revealed the wreckage crashed in a densely vegetated and marshy area, three miles east of Ruskin, Florida and 18 miles south of Tampa, Florida.  Examination of the aircraft revealed damage to the bottom of the fuselage, one main rotor blade was severed three and a half feet from blade-retaining bolt, both pitch change links fractured, the tail boom severed just forward of the horizontal stabilizers, one tail rotor blade was bent 90-degrees near the root of blade and the lower leading edge of the aft vertical fin was damaged.  It was also noted that the engine to transmission drive shaft exhibited a bend of 10-degrees.  Examination of the engine revealed no anomalies in the general physical condition and security of the engine as it was mounted in the accident helicopter.  King Laboratories in Tampa, Florida tested the fuel samples both from the helicopter and the tank from which the helicopter was refueled.  The samples were determined to be in compliance with the standards established for Jet A fuel.  The first five attempts to preform a functional test-run of the engine were unsuccessful and the original fuel control was replaced.  On the sixth attempt, the engine ran without issue.  The power turbine governor and fuel control were bench tested at the Honeywell facility and no pre-existing conditions were identified that would have prevented normal operation in either assembly.  An additional engine run with the original controls installed was performed at the Rolls-Royce plant and the engine ran without irregularities and nearly to performance standards for new production engines.

A 25-foot line and 140-gallon Bambi Bucket were attached to the helicopter's cargo hook.  The pilot then flew to a reservoir to pick up the first load of water.  There were no witnesses at the reservoir; however, witnesses nearby observed the helicopter drop down towards the reservoir behind a tree line and then rise back up above the tree line.  Two witnesses provided conflicting statements.  One reported that the helicopter spun rapidly in a clockwise direction, then stopped spinning and descended slowly back out of view below the tree line.  This witness reported that he could not hear the engine.  The other witness reported that the helicopter spun violently in a counterclockwise direction, and the engine was loud, then \"shutdown or stalled,\" and the helicopter stopped spinning and descended slowly out of view.  The helicopter was found approximately 10 feet from shore completely submerged in the reservoir with the exception of the right skid, which protruded from the water.  Small trees, with limb diameters ranging between 1 and 2 inches, were freshly cut along the bank in the vicinity of the helicopter.  Examination of the helicopter after it was recovered from the reservoir revealed damage consistent with the fuselage impacting the water in a level roll attitude with a nose down pitch attitude.  Damage to the main rotor blades indicated that they were rotating at nominal operational RPM at the time of impact.  No evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunction was found during the examination.  Disassembly of the engine, fuel control, and power turbine governor revealed no evidence of any anomalies that would have prevented the engine from producing power prior to impact.

The pilot began to taxi along the shore, but then decided to take off again to regain his bearings and land at his intended destination. At the time of the takeoff, night had already fallen, the moon was full, there were no clouds and lighting was flat. Surface conditions were \"full glass\" with no ripples, and the airplane's navigation lights and landing lights were illuminated. The pilot flew the airplane out over the lake, intending to make a 180-degree turn and land back towards a dock. During the final turn, he lost \"visual height reference,\" and after leveling the wings, he set up for a low-sink-rate, glassy water landing. He thought the airplane was about 100 feet above the water when it was only \"mere feet\" above the surface, which the airplane impacted at a high speed and a high sink rate. Upon impact, the floats tore off the airplane, which then nosed over. Both occupants exited, and as they were swimming to shore, they were picked up by a boat. The pilot did not note any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.

The pilot subsequently performed an autorotation. During the autorotation, the left front door opened, and the cabin then filled with black smoke. The pilot subsequently landed the helicopter upright in an open area, and he and the passengers egressed. The pilot stated that, upon exit, he saw fire originating from about 2 ft aft of the right forward door; the fire consumed most of the helicopter. \u000b\u000bExamination of the helical power train drive assembly revealed that the No. 4 bearing rollers were exposed to intense heat and that one of the rollers exhibited evidence of flat spotting, consistent with a skidding roller. The No. 4 bearing separator was fractured through one roller pocket at three locations, and the fracture surfaces were oxidized, which prevented the identification of a specific fracture mode. Signatures observed on the No. 4 bearing and the pinion gear were consistent with damage generated from the bearing spinning on the pinion gear. It is likely that the failure of the No. 4 bearing generated heat, which caused the expansion and softening of the aft end of the power train pinion gear and resulted in the gear disconnecting from the turbine shaft-to-pinion gear coupling splines. As a result of this disconnection, the load on the power turbine was suddenly removed, which resulted in an overspeed of the 3rd- and 4th-stage turbine wheels and the subsequent separation of their shrouds and blades, some of which were liberated from the engine. Several exit holes caused by high-energy debris were found in-line with the fuel control unit and power turbine governor, which likely was the source of the in-flight fire. Oil filters that had been retained by the operator\u2019s mechanic during previous troubleshooting were examined, and they contained particles consistent with two different alloys used to manufacture the pinion gear and bearing races, respectively, indicating that a problem existed before the accident flight.\u000b\u000bAbout 15 years before the accident, the manufacturer issued a service bulletin (SB) that outlined the replacement of both the Nos. 3 and 4 bearings with updated bearings before the end of 2002, which was 11 years before the accident. During engine disassembly, the No. 3 bearing was found to have been replaced with the updated bearing as outlined in the SB; the maintenance logbooks did not indicate when this bearing was replaced. However, the No. 4 bearing was found to have the same serial and part numbers as the original bearings installed in the engine about 17 years before the accident.

The pilot made a wheels up  forced landing into a field. Maintenance history revealed that the engine had a propeller strike on February 19, 2003. The engine was removed from the airplane and sent to Certified Engines Unlimited, for special  inspection. The engine had a total time since major overhaul (TTSMOH) of 509.2 hours. On March 21, 2003, the engine was reinstalled on the airplane and returned to service. On May 13, 2003, the engine was removed and sent to Certified Engines Unlimited, due to a crankshaft counterweight failure TTSMOH 535.1 hours. The counterweights were replaced and the engine was reinstalled on the airplane June 12, 2003. On October 7, 2003 while in cruise flight the airplane had a catastrophic engine failure TTSMOH 734.1 hours. Examination of the engine at TCM found the crankshaft  fractured through the number one connecting rod journal forward fillet radius and upper counterweight hanger blade. The rear upper crankshaft counterweight was detached from its hanger blade. One plate and snap-ring was forced from their locations on each side of the counterweight by mechanical action of the pins. The counterweight plates of this counterweight were bowed outward in relationship to their installed positions. One of the snap-rings was fractured in two pieces and both snap-rings that were not in place exhibited signatures of being forced from their retaining grooves in the counterweight. The remaining rear counterweight exhibited sever mechanical damage and was intact on the hanger blade. The forward set of counterweights, pins, plates and snap-rings were intact and undamaged and had free and unrestricted movement on the hanger blades.",

The aircraft settled and impacted the ground.  The pilot stated that the engine was still spooling down as he exited the aircraft.  When the engine compressor section was examined, it was determined that the internal compressor case plastic coating was cracked with sections of the plastic missing.  Erosion which exceeded the manufacturer's allowable limits was visible through the first four vane stages and was most evident in the lower case half.  According to the engine manufacturer, when compressor erosion is unchecked it will eventually result in a fatigue fracture of one of the vanes due to a loss of stiffness.  The maintenance manual states that the compressor case should be replaced if any vanes are cracked, broken, or show any evidence of tip rub on the rotor spacer.  It further states that corrosion or erosion can cause damage to the compressor blades and vanes that can result in engine failure.  The manufacturer specifies inspection intervals of the compressor case should be determined by the operating environment, but in any case, should not exceed 300 hours. The compressor case halves had were replaced in December 1996 and had accumulated approximately 600 hours at the time of the accident.  They had not been inspected since being overhauled.  The pilot reported that the helicopter had been operating in desert terrain. ",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot, who was SK Jets\u2019 president, owner, and director of operations, received a call from one of his company schedulers about 0335, notifying him about a trip for his largest customer to transport a doctor and a medical technician from Mayo Clinic Heliport, Jacksonville, Florida, to Shands Cair Heliport, Gainesville, Florida, to procure an organ for transplant. To prepare for this flight, the pilot reviewed aviation routine weather reports (METARs) and terminal area forecasts (TAFs) on the Internet; however, he did not obtain a standard weather briefing from a Federal Aviation Administration-approved source. At the time of his review of the METARs and TAFs, weather conditions near the departure heliport were visual meteorological conditions (VMC), with visibility of 10 miles and a broken cloud ceiling at 7,000 feet. Weather conditions were also VMC near Shands Cair Heliport, with visibility of 6 miles and a broken cloud ceiling at 1,600 feet. A TAF included a temporary condition during the estimated time of arrival near Shands Cair Heliport of instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) with visibility of 4 miles in mist and an overcast cloud ceiling at 400 feet. Just before the accident flight, the helicopter completed a short, uneventful repositioning flight from the operator\u2019s home base at a nearby airport to Mayo Clinic Heliport. During that flight, although the helicopter initially climbed to about 1,000 feet above ground level (agl), it then flew between 700 and 900 feet agl, possibly due to a low cloud ceiling. About 0537, the helicopter picked up the doctor and medical technician at Mayo Clinic Heliport, departed, and proceeded southwest, flying a track slightly south and east of a direct course to Shands Cair Heliport. The pilot likely selected this route of flight so that he could navigate by landmarks and fly low in order to stay out of clouds. The pilot contacted an air traffic controller 4 minutes before the accident to ask about the status of restricted airspace, which he learned was inactive at the time. The transmissions were routine, and there was no evidence that the pilot or helicopter were experiencing any problems. During the en route portion of the 17 minute accident flight, the helicopter\u2019s altitude varied between about 450 and 950 feet agl. The helicopter\u2019s airspeed was about 100 to 110 knots. The last three radar returns were consistent with a right turn of about 45 degrees and a 300-foot descent, which placed the helicopter on a near-direct west course to Shands Cair Heliport at an altitude about 450 feet agl. The accident site was located about 1/2 mile south of the last radar return, with a southerly debris path, consistent with a significant change in course and left turn with a continued descent. The 320-foot-long straight debris field, with descending cuts into trees, was indicative of substantial forward speed at the time of impact. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the engine, drive train, main rotor, tail rotor, or structure of the helicopter. Additionally, there was no indication of an in-flight fire. The accident helicopter was not certified for instrument flight rules (IFR) flight and did not have an autopilot or radar altimeter. Further, the helicopter\u2019s global positioning system did not have an optional modification that would have included a terrain and obstacle warning feature. The operator\u2019s general operating manual (GOM) noted that unless otherwise approved by the director of operations or chief pilot, the weather minimums for visual flight rules (VFR) flight in a helicopter at night were a 1,000 foot cloud ceiling and 3-mile visibility. The GOM did not address whether the pilot, as director of operations, could approve himself to deviate from the night VFR minimums in a helicopter. All weather information suggests that there were areas of both VMC and IMC along the route of flight. The recorded weather near Mayo Clinic Heliport about 16 minutes after departure, when the helicopter was nearly halfway between Mayo Clinic Heliport and Shands Cair Heliport, included a broken cloud ceiling at 700 feet. Further, airmen\u2019s meteorological information (AIRMET) Sierra was in effect at the time of the accident and indicated the potential for IFR conditions with mist and fog covering the route of flight and accident site. Although the pilot likely did not receive this AIRMET, the pilot did receive the information about the TAF indicating possible IMC. A former company helicopter pilot familiar with the flight route described the accident area as susceptible to fog due to swampy terrain and indicated that once fog develops (which would obscure the ground and surface features), the area was a \u201cblack hole\u201d at altitudes of 200 to 400 feet agl, and a flight was effectively in IMC in these circumstances. During postaccident interviews, other company pilots stated that they would have accepted the trip based on weather reports presented but would have arranged a backup plan, such as ground transportation or transportation by fixed-wing aircraft, if the flight could not be completed. There was no evidence the pilot had arranged such a backup plan in the event that the trip could not be completed as scheduled due to the potential for IMC. (Although SK Jets used a flight risk analysis tool [FRAT] to assess risk of both helicopter and fixed-wing flights, a FRAT form was not recovered for the accident flight. However, had the FRAT form been filled out, it would have shown that the flight was low risk.)The pilot\u2019s financial pressure as the owner of the company likely influenced his decision to continue flight into deteriorating weather conditions. The operator\u2019s business had declined several years before the accident as a result of economic recession. The accident helicopter had been leased days before the accident. The operator\u2019s only IFR certified helicopter, which was the largest customer\u2019s preferred helicopter, had been down for maintenance for 4 months while the operator attempted to secure loans for engine maintenance. The pilot was scheduled to meet with this customer in the coming weeks to obtain clarification about the customer\u2019s requirements. The pilot was also aware that his largest customer had begun identifying other aviation companies that might better fulfill its needs. Thus, the pilot would have been highly motivated to complete trips as requested so that he could demonstrate the reliability of his service. Additionally, due to the economic downturn, the pilot\u2019s company had lost millions of dollars during the 3 years before the accident. Therefore, the pilot likely wanted to make the most of every revenue generating opportunity. Review of the pilot\u2019s medical history revealed a 30-year history of hypertension and several other conditions, including insomnia, all of which were well controlled with medication. A postmortem analysis indicated that the levels of medication for insomnia that were in the pilot\u2019s system at the time of the accident were below the therapeutic range and did not imply impairment. His routine conversation with a controller just minutes before the accident suggests that he was not incapacitated.Regarding the pilot\u2019s work, rest, and sleep history, review of company records revealed that the pilot had not flown in the 7 days before the accident and had spent the previous 2 days with family, celebrating his anniversary and a holiday, indicating that he was not overworked during the days before the accident. The pilot experienced some circadian disruption during the 2 nights preceding the accident. Although he normally awoke about 0630, he awoke about 0800 the day before the accident and about 0330 the morning of the accident, and the accident occurred before his normal waking time. In addition, the pilot had experienced some sleep restriction for 2 nights preceding the accident. He obtained about 5 hours of sleep during each of those nights. However, according to the pilot\u2019s wife, the pilot had been a 6 hour a night sleeper for the past 50 years and felt well rested on 6 hours of sleep. In addition, he supplemented his nighttime sleep with a 1- to 1 1/2-hour nap during the afternoon the day before the flight. Therefore, the reduction in his recent sleep, compared with his reported sleep need, was very small. Although the pilot likely experienced some fatigue on the morning of the accident because of circadian disruption and reduced sleep, the pilot\u2019s reduction in total sleep was quite low compared to his reported sleep need, and the National Transportation Safety Board was unable to determine the extent to which fatigue might have affected the pilot\u2019s preflight decision-making and performance during the accident flight.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s improper decision to continue visual flight into night instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain. Contributing to the pilot\u2019s improper decision was his self-induced pressure to complete the trip."

After multiple attempts to lower the landing gear, the flight instructor declared an emergency, took control of the airplane, and prepared for a gear-up landing. During touchdown, the airplane left the paved portion of the runway, and was substantially damaged.A postaccident examination of the landing gear system revealed that the hydraulic nose gear door actuator line on the right side of the aircraft failed due to fatigue at the flared end of the line. Review of maintenance records revealed that a high pressure electric fuel pump had been installed in close proximity to the failed line. No identification information or manufacturer information was present on the line and the straight sections of the tubing were not completely straight indicating that it had been bent by hand. A wear mark corresponding to significant contact with another object was observed on the aft side of the upper horizontal portion of the line which was covered by a plastic sleeve wrapped in electrical tape. It was likely that contact at that location produced excessive bending loads on the hydraulic line at the flare which lead to the fatigue fracture. Removal of the plastic sleeve which appeared to have been installed as a chaff guard revealed the existence of two other wear marks on the hydraulic line, one of which was approximately 50 percent of the wall thickness deep. The location of the wear marks corresponded to the location of the electric pump that had been installed and its fuel line fittings.According to the Federal Aviation Administration, tubing should not be nicked, cut, dented, collapsed, or twisted beyond approved limits. When inspection shows a line to be damaged or defective, the entire line should be replaced or, if the damaged section is localized, a repair section may be inserted. Minor dents and scratches in tubing may be repaired. Scratches or nicks not deeper than 10 percent of the wall thickness in aluminum alloy tubing, that are not in the heel of a bend, may be repaired by burnishing with hand tools. Lines with severe die marks, seams, or splits should be replaced. Any crack or deformity in a flare is unacceptable and cause for rejection. A dent less than 20 percent of the tube diameter is not objectionable unless it is in the heel of a bend.",

He then observed the wind sock in the 'calm' position, and taxied the airplane to the approach end of runway 13 for takeoff. During the takeoff roll the airplane encountered a gust of wind from 120 degrees, which 'lifted the airplane off the ground prematurely.' The airplane 'stalled;' subsequently, the left wing contacted the ground first and the airplane ground looped.

The controller advised him to land at an airport that was 4 miles away. Shortly after, the pilot contacted the alternate airport\u2019s air traffic control tower (ATCT) and reported that he was low on fuel. The tower controller cleared the airplane to land, and, about 30 seconds later, the pilot advised that he was not going to make it to the airport. The airplane subsequently impacted a field 3.25 miles southeast of the airport. One witness reported hearing the engine sputter, and another witness reported that the engine \u201cdid not sound right.\u201d Forty-foot power lines crossed the field 311 feet from the point of impact. It is likely that the pilot was attempting to avoid the power lines during the forced landing and that the airplane then experienced an inadvertent stall and an uncontrolled collision with terrain. About 1 quart of fuel was observed in each fuel tank. No evidence of fuel spillage was found on the ground; no fuel stains were observed on the undersides of the wing panels, wing trailing edges, or engine nacelles; and no fuel smell was observed at the accident site. However, the fuel totalizer showed that 123 gallons of fuel was remaining. Magnification of the annunciator panel light bulbs revealed that the left and right low fuel pressure annunciator lights were illuminated at the time of impact. An examination of the airframe and engines revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. About 1 month before the accident, the pilot had instructed the fixed-base operator at Camden, Arkansas, to put 25 gallons of fuel in each wing tank; however, it is unknown how much fuel was already onboard the airplane. Although the fuel totalizer showed that the airplane had 123 gallons of fuel remaining at the time of the crash, information in the fuel totalizer is based on pilot inputs, and it is likely the pilot did not update the fuel totalizer properly before the accident flight. The pilot was likely relying on the fuel totalizer instead of the fuel gauges for fuel information, and he likely reported his low fuel situation to the ATCT after the annunciator lights illuminated. ",

            "narrative": "On July 29, 2015, about 1400 eastern daylight time, an experimental amateur-built Mosquito helicopter, N285XE, was substantially damaged during a forced landing near Winchendon, Massachusetts. The commercial pilot/owner/builder was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local flight, which originated from Jaffrey Airport (AFN), Jaffrey, New Hampshire. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.The pilot completed an uneventful 40-minute flight in the airport traffic pattern at AFN, then landed and refueled the helicopter with 93 octane automotive fuel. He subsequently departed about 1300 for a flight in the local area. About 1 hour into the flight, and while flying at an altitude of 2,500 feet msl, the pilot felt the helicopter suddenly \"kick from loss of torque.\" He then observed that the engine rpm had dropped to about 30 percent, and he was unable to increase engine power using the throttle control. The pilot responded by performing an autorotation to an open field. During the landing, the helicopter touched down \"hard,\" and the main rotor system struck the tailboom, resulting in substantial damage to the airframe and tail rotor drive system.About two weeks after the accident, the pilot conducted a test run of the engine on the airframe. Review of video from the test run showed engine started without hesitation and ran at idle rpm with no obvious deficiencies noted. The pilot subsequently inspected the engine following the test run and noted that the interior of the engine was contaminated with liquid coolant. A detailed examination of the engine was scheduled for a later date.According to Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness records, the single-seat helicopter was issued experimental amateur-built aircraft operating limitations in April 2015. The helicopter was equipped with an Innovator Technologies Inntec 800 two-stroke engine, rated at 85 hp. At the time of the accident, the airframe and engine had accumulated 25 total flight hours.",

After parking, the pilots reported to the attendants that the airplane\u2019s fuel/air mixture was difficult to establish at such a high-density altitude and that, if the engine was operated too lean, its temperature exceeded normal operation parameters. Later that day, the pilots departed in dark night conditions.

The airplane, with the pilot/owner and a pilot-rated passenger aboard, had departed the east coast in the morning and had been en route for about 16 hours. It could not be determined which of the two pilots was manipulating the flight controls at the time of the accident. The planned length of the last leg of the flight was 660 nm, which was about equal to the airplane\u2019s calculated maximum range for a no wind condition with a 45 minute reserve. Radar data revealed that during the last few minutes of the flight, the airplane changed course several times toward different nearby airports. These heading excursions were most likely due to a decision by the pilots to divert to an alternate airport after realizing that the destination airport could possibly be beyond the current range of the airplane. The last radar return was about 0.1 nm south of the accident site, which was located in a remote, sparsely populated area. Examination of the accident site revealed signatures, including tree strikes and wreckage distribution, consistent with controlled flight into terrain.  Postaccident examination of the engine and airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilots lost situational awareness and failed to maintain terrain clearance. Conditions conducive to controlled flight into terrain included fatigue due to the pilots\u2019 long duty day, the dark night light condition, the lack of ground lighting in the region, and the fact that neither pilot was instrument rated.",

The private pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the personal flight that was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.The airplane was built by the pilot and based at SEF. Its construction was based on a Sonerai homebuilt airplane kit, and it was equipped with a converted Volkswagen 75-horsepower automobile engine. The fuselage was constructed of steel tubing with fabric covering and the wings were constructed of aluminum. The airplane was issued an experimental special airworthiness certificate by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on July 7, 2009.According to a friend of the pilot, about 2 years prior to the accident, the pilot was flying the airplane when it experienced a loss of engine power just after takeoff, due to a clogged fuel filter. The pilot landed back on the runway and the airplane sustained a propeller strike. The accident flight was the airplane's first flight since that incident. Recent maintenance included replacing the fuel filter and converting the airplane from a tailwheel to tricycle landing gear configuration.Witnesses near the accident site reported hearing a \"spitting and sputtering\" engine as they observed the airplane descending from a low altitude. The airplane touched down on the ground, slid for about 75-feet and came to rest upright, adjacent to a canal, behind a residence that was located about 1 mile from SEF. The right aileron, nose landing gear, and wooden propeller fragments were located along a ground scar leading to the main wreckage. A postcrash fire destroyed the cockpit, and consumed the propeller and all fuselage fabric coverings forward of the empennage. The right wing sustained impact damage to the tip and forward outboard leading edge. The inboard 4 feet of the left wing was consumed to the spar and the majority of the wing was fire damaged. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit controls to the rudder and elevator control surfaces. The respective left and right aileron connections were displaced consistent with impact damage. The airplane's entire fuel system, which included the fuel tank located aft of the engine, the carburetor and fuel filter were consumed by fire. The engine was also fire damaged, and subsequently retained for further examination.The pilot reported 1,950 hours of total flight experience on his most recent application for an FAA third class medical certificate, which was issued on November 10, 2014.",

The airplane's airspeed began to decrease as the airplane climbed to about 47 ft above ground level and then began rolling left; the recording then ended. Witnesses reported observing the airplane roll, descend, and impact terrain. The data and the witness statements are consistent with the airplane having experienced an aerodynamic stall. A postaccident examination of the composite propeller found that it did not display signatures of rotation during impact, consistent with a total loss of engine power. The engine manufacturer's initial installation used a single battery with a series of breakers and relays to provide power to the engine components and other equipment. This design was subsequently replaced by a dual-battery design that incorporated a simpler wiring harness. The airplane was originally wired for a single-battery operation, and a second battery was subsequently added. However, the simpler wiring harness was not used; instead the electrical path from the alternator to the alternator sense wire used a complex series of fuses to provide power to the components; one of these fuses was found open, which is indicative of an electrical power failure and would have led to the loss of engine power. Although the onboard avionics device did not record the airplane's loss of engine power, descent, or impact with terrain, the interruption of the recorded data likely resulted from the electrical failure. The pilot had removed the airplane\u2019s slats 9 days before the accident; the accident flight was the pilot\u2019s first flight in the airplane with the new configuration. According to the kit designer, the airplane was not designed to fly with the slats removed because it would result in a higher stall speed with a distinct stall break and roll if the flight was not coordinated. In addition, the pilot had recently resumed flying after not having flown in about 45 years. Although he had received 2 hours of dual instruction about 2 months before the accident, after a test flight in a company airplane, another pilot assessed the accident pilot\u2019s piloting skills as poor and advised him to obtain further instruction; however, the accident pilot did not do so. Given his lack of recent flight experience, he was likely not properly prepared for how to respond to a loss of engine power and the subsequent stall.",

The FAA inspector who responded to the accident site reported that fuel was in the fuel tanks.  A visual inspection of the engine revealed no obvious mechanical failures.  Investigators made unsuccessful attempts to run the engine; it would start, but would not remain running.  The engine driven fuel pump was removed and investigators noted that the mating splines in the drive shaft were severely worn.  A review of the engine logbook revealed that a field overhauled engine and an overhauled fuel pump had been installed on the airframe about a year prior to the accident; an annual inspection had been completed at the time of the engine installation.  The owner reported a total of 149.38 hours of operation since the annual inspection.  An FAA approved repair station had overhauled the fuel pump.  The fuel pump was submitted to the Safety Board Materials Laboratory for further examination.  A senior metallurgist observed wear and metal flow on the square key portion of the fuel pump shaft.  There was no evidence of cracking or wear of the drive gear splined teeth.  The metallurgist manually rotated the fuel pump and was able to achieve only intermittent engagement between the square key and corresponding slot.

The student pilot sustained minor injuries and his two passengers sustained serious injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day meteorological conditions were reported at the time of the accident at a location near the accident site. The local area flight was originating at the time of the accident.According to first responders, the pilot reported that the airplane experienced a loss of engine power shortly after departing on runway 32 (2,600 feet by 160 feet, grass/turf). The airplane subsequently impacted a cornfield about 50 feet past the runway's departure threshold.The closest aviation weather observing station was located at the Southwest Minnesota Regional Airport (MML), Marshall, Minnesota, about 17 miles northeast of the accident site. At 0855, the automated surface observing system reported: wind 320 degrees magnetic at 8 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear sky conditions, temperature 13 degrees Celsius, dew point 08 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.21 inches-of-mercury.",

He reported that he was 5 minutes from landing, and said he was circling to the left, to land the opposite direction from the published approach. The traffic pattern for the approach runway was right traffic. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and the weather conditions included a visibility of 3 statute miles in light rain and mist; few clouds at 400 feet, 1,000 feet overcast; temperature, 55 degrees F; dew point, 55 degrees F. The minimum descent altitude, either for a lateral navigation approach, or a circling approach, was 580 feet, and required a visibility of 1 mile. The missed approach procedure was a right climbing turn. A circling approach north of the runway was not approved. Witnesses reported that the weather included low clouds and reduced visibility due to fog and drizzle. The airplane was heard, but not seen, circling several times over the city, which was north of the runway. Witnesses saw the airplane descending in a wings level, 30-45 degree nose down attitude from the base of clouds,  pitch up slightly, and then collide with several trees and an unoccupied house. A postcrash fire consumed the residence, and destroyed the airplane. A review of FAA radar data indicated that as the accident airplane flew toward the airport, its altitude slowly decreased and its flight track appeared to remain to the left side (north) of the runway. The airplane's lowest altitude was 800 feet as it neared the runway, and then climbed to 1,700 feet, where radar contact was lost, north of the runway. During the postaccident examination of the airplane, no mechanical malfunction was found.  Given the lack of any mechanical deficiencies with the airplane, it is likely the pilot was either confused about the proper approach procedures, or elected to disregard them, and abandoned the instrument approach prematurely in his attempt to find the runway.  It is unknown why he decided to do a circle to land approach, when the tailwind component was slight, and the shorter, simpler, straight in approach was a viable option.  Likewise, it is unknown why he flew towards rising terrain on the north side of the runway, contrary to the published procedures. From the witness statements, it appears the pilot was \"hunting\" for the airport, and intentionally dove the airplane towards what he perceived was an area close to it. In the process, he probably saw trees and terrain, attempted to climb, but was too low to avoid the trees.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain altitude/distance from obstacles during an IFR circling approach, and his failure to follow the instrument approach procedure.  Contributing to the accident was clouds."

Both airline transport pilots were uninjured, and the airplane sustained minor damage. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the instructional flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The local flight originated from Laurence G. Hanscom Field (BED) Bedford, Massachusetts at 1245. According to the flight instructor, she was giving the pilot an insurance company checkout in the airplane. They departed with 72 gallons of fuel onboard with the pilot at the controls. After performing several touch-and-go landings at a nearby airport they decided to return to BED. About 8 miles from their destination they received clearance to enter downwind for runway 11. They completed the pre-landing checklist and began a descent. After leveling off at 1,700 ft. mean sea level and about 5 miles from the airport the engine started running \"very rough and shaking violently.\" The pilot then handed off the flight controls to the flight instructor. The pilot performed the emergency checklist and about 15 seconds later the propeller stopped turning completely. The flight instructor pitched for best glide while they searched for a suitable landing site. They selected a field to their right and turned to initiate their approach. At 600 ft. msl the pilots decided they would not make the field and elected to activate the parachute system. They pulled the handle \"according to the placard\" and shut off the mixture. The parachute deployed and the pilots felt a \"very strong backwards pull\". The airplane then rocked back and forth. The pilots shut off the fuel selector, fuel pump, magnetos and switches while descending in a slight nose down attitude. The airplane eventually impacted the ground and came to rest in a swamp.The wreckage was retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

Upon completion of the observation flight, the pilot returned to the police department and shut down the helicopter to allow the two officers to exit. The pilot then restarted the helicopter and departed en route to an airport where he could refuel the helicopter.  A witness near the accident site stated that he heard the helicopter\u2019s engine sputter and stop and saw the main rotor separate from the helicopter. The helicopter entered an uncontrolled descent and impacted terrain.Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that there was no usable fuel on board and that the main rotor mast separated as a result of overload due to mast bumping (main rotor hub to rotor mast contact).  No preimpact mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter were noted. Mast bumping typically results from a low-G flight condition caused by the pilot pushing the cyclic control forward abruptly from either straight-and-level flight or after a climb. Pushing the cyclic forward abruptly is contrary to the appropriate actions for entering an autorotation, which are lowering the collective pitch control to the full down position, adding antitorque pedal as needed to maintain heading, and applying cyclic as needed to maintain proper airspeed.Review of the pilot\u2019s medical records indicated that he had a history of depression, anxiety, and obstructive sleep apnea. Each of these conditions had been documented and treated since 2007, and none were reported to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on the pilot\u2019s airman medical application in 2010 or earlier. Any of these conditions may have disqualified the pilot from obtaining an airman\u2019s medical certificate. Postmortem toxicological testing indicated that the pilot was taking alprazolam, an anti-anxiety medication, and venlafaxine, an anti-depressant. Alprazolam is one of a class of drugs which may worsen obstructive sleep apnea, and venlafaxine can cause fatigue and dizziness. The fact that the blood level of venlafaxine found was higher than normal therapeutic levels makes it more likely that the side effect of dizziness occurred and impaired the pilot\u2019s performance.   ",
            "probable_cause": "The total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion, which resulted from the pilot's inadequate preflight planning and decision-making, and his improper control inputs following the loss of engine power, which resulted in mast bumping and separation of the main rotor. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's improper judgment in acting as a pilot with disqualifying medical conditions."

Because there was a jet being moved at the west-most portion of the open area preceding the ramp, the pilot chose to taxi north through east portion of the open area that was next to the where his tie-down spot was.  The pilot said he was taxiing at a normal \"fast walking pace\" with engine power set at 1,000 rpm.  As he approached the north side of the open area, the pilot said he heard a loud banging noise and felt the airplane pitch over on its nose.  The pilot said the tires had contacted a helicopter dolly, \"causing a sudden stop and pitch-over.\"  The airplane's impact with the dolly caused substantial damage to the bottom fuselage structure and the landing gear strut attach points.  The helicopter dolly was a 10-by-10 foot square, 1 foot high, wooden deck.  The platform had a metal frame with castered wheels, foot pads, and a \"Y-shaped\" tow bar.  The deck was a natural wood color.  The frame around the deck was painted white.  The dolly was located at the northwest corner of the TAC Air ramp abeam the A3 taxiway, and approximately 18 feet south of the west to east running yellow taxi stripe that leads from taxiway \"A\" to the ramp.  The pilot said that while taxiing, he was actively scanning for conflicts and noting all aircraft and vehicles in the vicinity.  He said never saw the dolly until the airplane struck it.  The pilot said about his airplane, \"... it has decent forward visibility when in the three-point configuration and normally does not require weaving to be able to see objects off the nose.  At only one foot high, completely flat, and neutral in color, the object (helicopter dolly) is quite difficult to spot.  The dolly was placed in a common movement area.\"  The area through which the pilot taxied was considered a non-movement area.  According to the 2005 Aeronautical Information Manual, non-movement areas are taxiways and apron (ramp) areas not under control of air traffic.  Aircraft clearance from other aircraft or objects while taxiing in these areas is the responsiblity of the pilot.  FAA  inspectors observed a faded \"NO TAXI\" marking on the non-movement  area approximately 30 feet south of the helicopter dolly.  The marking was located such that the pilot would have taxied over it before striking the helicopter dolly.",

The pilot initiated an emergency landing along a county road but switched to another road to avoid power lines.  Upon touchdown, the aircraft departed the side of the road and struck a fence post.  The engine was examined and test run, and no discrepancies were observed.  The pilot stated that 'other pilots at the scene agreed the conditions could cause carburetor icing.' According to the FAA inspector present at the accident scene, 'the conditions were a classic setup for carburetor icing.'  The Van's Aircraft construction and operating manual states that one method of building the carburetor heat system is to 'run a 2-inch air hose from a heat muff and position it to feed into the alternative air inlet of the carb[uretor] air box,' which is the method by which the pilot constructed the airplane.  According to the inspector, the 2-inch hose is not large enough to adequately supply enough heat to the carburetor to sufficiently melt the ice. The aircraft was issued an airworthiness certificate by the FAA on August 24, 1995. ",

The company pilot subsequently asked the accident pilot a question, to which the accident pilot did not respond. There were no further communications with the accident pilot. A lone hiker in the area reported observing the airplane fly from her left to her right in a right bank and below the rim of a canyon before it went out of sight. The airplane reappeared about a minute later, this time flying from her right to her left and still below the rim of the canyon, but lower and in a steep bank before it again went out of sight. The hiker subsequently came upon the airplane wreckage and reported its position to local authorities. The airplane was located in a confined canyon about 38 miles southwest of the destination airport. Wreckage and impact signatures were consistent with the airplane having impacted terrain in a nose low, right wing down attitude before impacting two trees. Propeller signatures were consistent with rotational forces being applied to the crankshaft at the time of impact. There was no postcrash fire.
