The airplane was equipped with an onboard satellite weather receiver, and, once airborne, the pilot contacted air traffic control and requested a deviation due to weather. The air traffic controller issued a deviation left of the planned course, and the pilot deviated accordingly. Shortly after reaching a cruise altitude of 23,000 feet mean sea level (msl) while in instrument meteorological conditions, the pilot saw a lightning flash, and the airplane subsequently entered a rapid ascent. Shortly after, he disconnected the autopilot and neutralized the flight controls, the stall warning sounded, and the pilot felt a \u201cfalling and twisting sensation.\u201d At this point, he suspected that the airplane was in a steep spiraling descent or spin; however, he could not confirm the airplane\u2019s attitude because the gyroscopic instruments had tumbled. Shortly after, the airplane exited the clouds, the pilot saw ground lighting, and he then initiated a recovery to a level flight attitude at an altitude of about 8,300 feet msl. After regaining control of the airplane, the pilot returned to the departure airport and subsequently landed without incident. The left and right elevators sustained substantial damage during the rapid descent.A significant meteorological information advisory and a severe thunderstorm watch were valid for the accident area at the time of the accident and warned of the potential for severe thunderstorms, hail, extreme turbulence, and wind gusts. The preflight weather briefing obtained by the pilot included this information. Postaccident review of upper air soundings and weather radar images indicated that the airplane passed through an area with gravity waves that likely caused extreme updrafts and/or downdrafts, windshear, and turbulence. Although current weather forecasting technology is able to predict environments conducive to the generation of gravity waves and gravity-wave ducts, the technology lacks the ability to predict if, where, and at what intensity these phenomena may form. Therefore, neither the pilot\u2019s preflight weather briefing nor his onboard weather satellite receiver would have detected the gravity-wave conditions along the airplane\u2019s flight route.",

The pilot, who did not possess an instrument flight rating, had received a standard weather briefing from a flight service station prior to departure.  The briefer advised the pilot that a cold front existed perpendicular to the airplane's route of flight that produced multiple cloud layers to 30,000 feet, overcast conditions, rain, nimbostratus clouds, moderate turbulence, and moderate icing conditions along the frontal boundary.  The airplane's radar track depicted the airplane cruising at 13,400 feet mean sea level (msl) on a steady southeasterly course.  Analysis of the weather conditions showed that the flight encountered instrument meteorological conditions and ice as it approached the frontal boundary.  Weather radar imagery depicted an encounter with the western edge of two bands of radar echoes, which could be associated with strong up- or downdrafts that could result in an upset to the airplane.  If the autopilot system were engaged it would have masked the trim and heading changes that usually accompanies ice accumulation, and upon disengagement of the autopilot system, the airplane would be in an unbalanced flight condition.  Recorded radar data showed that the last radar return in line with the southeasterly course occurred at 0901:54, with a mode C reported altitude of 13,400 feet msl.  The next three radar returns occurred between 0901:59 and 0902:14, and depicted the track in a right-hand turn and a descent to 12,400 feet msl, which was the last identified altitude.  This change in altitude corresponded to a 3,000- to 4,000-feet-per-minute rate of descent.  Numerous primary targets in patterns indicative of an in-flight breakup were identified in the same vicinity from 0902:14 to 0903:08.

The flight path and speed of the test balloons confirmed the weather forecasts obtained earlier, and he saw no significant winds either on the ground or aloft. Early in the flight, the pilot noticed that the winds aloft had increased significantly. He descended to assess how close to the ground the increased winds were, so that he could start to plan for a landing. As the balloon came close to treetop level, he experienced increased wind speeds, and decided to land as soon as possible. The pilot prepared the passengers for a fast, hard, drag landing. As he approached the landing site, he allowed the balloon basket to drag through the top of trees in an effort to reduce speed. The pilot estimated that they decreased their horizontal balloon speed by 50 percent. Once clear of the trees, and over the landing site, he vented the balloon to facilitate a fast descent into the field. He informed the passengers that they would have a very hard landing and warned them to get ready for impact. Two passengers had squatted in the balloon to avoid contact with the treetops, and never returned to the correct landing position, as previously instructed by the pilot. Those passengers sustained serious injuries during the hard landing. The reported wind at a nearby airport, about 30 minutes prior to the accident, was from 190 degrees at 5 knots.

As he reached the taxiway he steered to follow the centerline, however, the airplane continued to turn to the right. He reported, in part, that the left brake inputs were not responsive and the airplane continued to the right and collided with a standing occupied Cessna. Both airplanes sustained substantial damage, but neither the solo airline transport pilot of the Piper, or the commercial pilot and five passengers (skydivers) aboard the Cessna, were injured. Post accident examination of the Piper's brake assembly by inspectors from the Federal Aviation Administration revealed no evidence of abnormal wear or fluid leaks. The inspectors performed a function test on the brake systems and reported the assemblies did not properly engage when the brake pedals were actuated.

The airplane was being flown manually by the copilot, who reported that the landing approach speed (Vref) was 106 knots. The pilot-in-command (PIC) estimated that the airplane \"broke out\" of the clouds about two miles from the runway. Both pilots stated that the airplane continued to descend toward the runway, while on the glide slope and localizer.

The airplane impacted terrain about 35 miles east of the departure airport along a direct route to the destination airport. Examination of the airplane and engine revealed no preexisting mechanical anomalies and, at the crash site, a lack of damage to surrounding trees and the symmetrical aft crushing of both wings indicated that the airplane impacted the ground vertically, while in a stall/spin. Witnesses and recorded weather observations revealed the presence of heavy rain and high winds in the vicinity of the accident site at the time of the accident and the student pilot's flight instructor and a friend told him not to fly on the day of the accident due to the weather. At the time of the accident, the student pilot had accumulated 26 hours of total flight experience. Toxicology testing and evidence found in the wreckage suggested that the pilot had likely taken at least twice the prescribed dose of stimulant medications in the 40 hours preceding the accident, and likely ingested alcohol around the time of the flight.

A Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular (AC) stated that impact ice forms when moisture-laden air at temperatures below freezing strikes and freezes on parts of the airplane.  The AC further stated that pilots should be particularly alert for such icing when flying in snow, sleet, rain, or clouds and that it is usually preferable to use carburetor heat or alternate air as an ice prevention means, rather than as a deicer, because fast forming ice which is not immediately recognized by the pilot may significantly lower the amount of heat available from the carburetor heating system.

            "narrative": "On August 15, 2015, at 1002 eastern daylight time, a Cessna T206H; N63TV, was substantially damaged when it impacted trees and terrain after a loss of engine power during initial climb at Essex County Airport (CDW), Caldwell, New Jersey.  The commercial pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, destined for Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey. The positioning flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to a friend of the pilot, the purpose of the flight was to pick up the owner of the airplane at TEB for a flight lesson.Review of air traffic control (ATC) information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that prior to the accident, the pilot had requested to taxi and advised the air traffic controller that he had the current weather that was being transmitted by CDW's automatic terminal information service. The controller subsequently instructed the pilot to taxi to Runway 22 and to hold short of the runway at intersection \"November,\" which is normally used for airplanes departing on Runway 22. The controller then cleared the pilot for takeoff with a left turnout. Shortly after becoming airborne, the pilot advised that he had a \"problem\" declared an emergency, and requested to \"return to the field immediately.\" The controller then cleared the pilot to land on any runway and the pilot reported that he was unable to maintain engine power. There were no other communications from the airplane.  The airplane then rolled to the left, impacted trees and terrain, and a \"large fireball\" was observed.Review of security camera video revealed that during the takeoff the airplane appeared slow to accelerate and did not rotate until approximately half way down the runway. Once airborne, the airplane reached an altitude that was just above the trees that surrounded the airport before descending and turning left, where it then disappeared from view and a smoke cloud was observed to rise from behind a tree line.The accident site was located in a wooded area approximately 0.3 miles from the departure end of Runway 22. Examination of the accident site revealed that airplane impacted terrain on a 020 degree magnetic heading after striking several trees. Further examination revealed that the airplane impacted in a nose down inverted attitude. During the impact sequence, the engine was separated from its mounting location. The empennage was displaced approximately 20-degrees to the left of the fuselage centerline and was partially separated from the aft fuselage, and the wings were separated from their mounting locations. The fuselage came to rest upright on a 100 degree magnetic heading against the base of a tree. The majority of the fuselage was then consumed by a post impact fire.Examination of the wreckage revealed that the wing flaps were in the up position, the elevator trim was approximately neutral. The fuel selector valve was in the \"BOTH\" position and there was no evidence of blockage in the valve or fuel lines. Control continuity was established from the ailerons, elevator, and rudder, to the flight controls in the cockpit. There was no evidence of any inflight structural failure.Examination of the propeller and engine revealed that there was no evidence of propeller rotation during the impact sequence. Attempts to rotate the drive train by hand were unsuccessful. There was no evidence of any type of blockage in the intake or exhaust systems. The magnetos were fire damaged. The spark plug electrodes displayed evidence of black sooty deposits indicative of carbon fouling. A portion of the No. 3 piston's skirt was missing and metal fragments were present in the lubrication system.According to FAA records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane, a flight instructor certificate with a rating for airplane single engine, and a ground instructor certificate with an advanced ground instructor rating.  His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on March 30, 2015. He reported on that date, that he had accrued 1,690 total hours of flight experience.According to FAA and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 2009. Its most recent annual inspection was completed on April 17, 2015. At the time of the inspection, the airplane had accrued 1,155.4 total hours of operation.Portions of the engine, turbocharger system, and fuel injection system were retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

A postaccident examination revealed that the engine\u2019s single  magneto P-lead terminal end had made contact with an adjacent fabric covered steel braid oil cooler hose line. Closer examination of the ignition lead disclosed that chaffing had exposed the metal strand layer of the hose. The grounding of the magneto would have rendered the engine unable to produce power due to the lack of an ignition source. The condition of the propeller blades at the wreckage was consistent with the engine not operating at the time of ground impact.",

The flight instructor stated that they did not use carburetor heat nor did they clear the engine during the glide. The pilot landed the airplane and while still rolling, advanced the throttle for takeoff. Immediately after liftoff, the flight instructor noted that the engine was not accelerating above 2,100 rpm. She took control of the airplane, checked the engine instruments, fuel tank selector position, and fuel pressure, and confirmed that the throttle and mixture controls were full forward. The flight instructor did not apply carburetor heat. The flight instructor estimated that the airplane reached a maximum height of about 200 feet above ground level before impacting trees and a power line. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical discrepancies that would have prevented normal operation. Although the fuel tank selector valve was found slightly out of the detent for the right tank position, it still offered about 80 percent of the normal opening for fuel to pass. According to the engine manufacturer, carburetor ice can form \"under moist conditions (a relative humidity of 50 percent to 60 percent is moist enough) with any outside air temperature from 20 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\" The calculated relative humidity at the time of the accident was 79 percent.

She landed the airplane in the pasture the previous day due to a loss of engine power. She reported that the loss of power was due to debris in the right fuel tank, which was subsequently removed by a mechanic. She measured the length of the field and found that it was shorter than is typically required, but elected to continue with the flight due to the downhill slope of the field. The owner of the pasture mowed a path for the takeoff and the pilot and her husband inspected the takeoff area for rocks and other obstructions. She also determined a \"no-go\" point on the ground in case the airplane did not accelerate adequately. She removed all unnecessary items from the airplane and prepared for takeoff. During the takeoff roll, the airplane did not accelerate as expected. She aborted the takeoff past the designated no-go point and was unable to stop the airplane before it collided with a fence post. The airplane caught fire as the pilot was exiting the cockpit. The airplane received structural damage to the left wing and fuselage and the pilot experienced second-degree burns.

The pilot serviced the airplane to capacity with fuel and departed about 1 hour later. Turbulent crosswind and high density altitude conditions (9,369 feet) existed at the time of departure. A witness saw the airplane taxi along the 3,400-foot-long departure runway for about 1/3 of its length before beginning to accelerate. The passengers reported that, compared to previous flights, the airplane accelerated slower and took off farther down the runway, as would be expected due to the high density altitude. The pilot reported that the takeoff progressed normally until the airplane reached an altitude of about 200 feet above ground level. At that point, the airplane would no longer climb, and, certain that they would not be able to return to the airport, the pilot attempted to maneuver the airplane for landing in the field ahead. The passengers reported that, once airborne, the airplane rocked from side-to-side, and the stall warning horn operated continuously. The witness observed the airplane in an unusually nose-high attitude throughout the flight until it suddenly descended out of her view. The airplane impacted the ground in a flat attitude, sustaining crush damage in the vertical plane. Although the horizontal stabilizer sustained tree-strike damage, the wings did not; this damage pattern was consistent with the nose-high attitude observed by the witness. The airplane was loaded within its center of gravity envelope and was about 125 pounds below maximum gross weight. No evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure was noted during the postaccident examination of the airframe and engine. Review of recorded engine monitor data revealed that an appropriate level of power was being produced, and all engine parameters were normal. Although the mixture control was found in the full rich position, the pilot recalled that he leaned the mixture during taxi, and the power output determined from the engine monitor data was consistent with an appropriately leaned mixture. The pilot did not recall the extended runway taxi reported by the witness, however, performance calculations indicated that the remaining runway length would still have allowed for takeoff and adequate terrain clearance.",
