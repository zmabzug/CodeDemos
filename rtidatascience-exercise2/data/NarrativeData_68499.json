He did not file a flight plan, did not receive any other services for the accident flight, and departed in night visual meteorological conditions. According to GPS and air traffic control data, the airplane was flying on a southwesterly heading before it turned right. It subsequently turned left and then right before it entered a descending left turn and impacted terrain. Examinations of the airframe and engines revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Further, there was no evidence of a medical impairment that would have affected the pilot's performance. A review of the plot\u2019s logbooks revealed no entries for night or instrument flight in the year before the accident.A National Weather Service observation from about 15 miles southwest of the accident site showed rapidly changing conditions with a band of snow moving across the region at the time of the accident. In addition, the next observation showed a lowering ceiling that was overcast to broken from 3,200 to 2,800 ft above ground level; snow started falling about 26 minutes after the accident. Considering the weather conditions around the time of the accident, it is likely that the pilot inadvertently encountered instrument meteorological conditions in light snow with no visible surface lights and, as a result, had to transition to relying solely on the instruments.

He further reported that the takeoff rotation occurred about 3,100 ft down the 7,395-ft-long runway, that the airplane\u2019s nose rose to a higher pitch attitude than expected, and that the tail felt heavy or \u201csquishy.\u201d The pilot reduced the throttle setting to lower the airplane\u2019s nose, but the airplane\u00a0entered a left yaw with the left wing down. The pilot reapplied full throttle, but the airplane rolled slightly left. At this point, the airplane was over the dirt area between the main runway and the adjacent taxiway. The pilot suspected that the main landing gear dragged at different points with the airplane\u2019s nose still in a high-pitch attitude. The fuselage struck the ground, and the airplane subsequently slid to a stop. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.According to the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook, given the reported meteorological conditions at the time of takeoff, the airplane\u2019s normal rotation speed would have been 82 KIAS for a 0-degree flap configuration at the maximum gross weight of 5,092 lbs, and\u00a0the liftoff speed would have been 85 KIAS; the airplane\u2019s computed gross weight at the time of the accident was 5,218 lbs. In addition, the normal takeoff ground roll would have been 3,150 ft, and 4,800 ft would have been required to clear a 50-ft obstacle. Based on the evidence, it is likely that the\u00a0pilot rotated the airplane at a slower airspeed than the published normal rotation speed with the airplane over its maximum gross weight limit and that the airplane was unable to climb after liftoff.

Prior to the accident takeoff, the windsock was indicating variable winds from 290 degrees.  The CFI and the student had a brief discussion about downhill and downwind takeoffs.  After a preflight, they taxied to the runway.  The airplane did not accelerate as expected, and the remaining runway was insufficient to abort.

An on-scene inspection disclosed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomalies with either the flight controls or engine.  Fuel samples were collected from the helicopter's carburetor and fuel tanks.  Analysis disclosed water in the carburetor fuel, but none in the fuel tanks.  A fuel sample was also taken from the pilot's storage tank at his residence, which was under a building without rain gutters.  The fuel from the storage tank had a layer of water and sediment.  Detailed analysis of the water and sediment found in the carburetor fuel indicated that the contamination was consistent with run-off from a building's roof.  The helicopter's engine was provided fresh fuel and operated successfully.  During the investigation, an aviation mechanic related that about two weeks before the accident, the pilot had lost one of the helicopter's fuel caps, and had obtained a replacement cap.  ",

A search and rescue (SAR) crew located the airplane after the issuance of a family concerned alert notification (ALNOT).  A review of the radar data showed a target consistent with the accident airplane at a mode C reported altitude of 12,300 feet mean sea level (msl) at 1103:45.  The target continued in a westerly direction, and at 1104:56, the mode C altitude was 5,000 feet, which equates to a calculated 9,400 feet per minute (fpm) rate of descent.  The last target was 12 seconds later at 1105:08, at a mode C altitude of 3,300 feet.  The primary wreckage consisted of the fuselage, right wing, landing gear, and engine.  The left wing was 1 mile west of the main wreckage on the eastern slope of a mountain peak.  The left main wing spar separated from the inboard stub section, with compression wrinkles noted in the webbing of the outboard left main wing spar.  The lower spar cap had a smooth fracture surface and the upper spar cap had an angular fracture surface, features consistent with the wing failing in negative aerodynamic loading.  The right wing main spar remained attached to the stub carry through spar and the webbing was also wrinkled.  Analysis of the meteorological conditions disclosed that a strong west-southwesterly jet stream was advecting mid- and high-level moisture from off Baja, California, into the southwestern United States.  Light rain and rain showers were occurring over southern California and were associated with this moisture advection.  The closest weather reporting facility was somewhat downstream of the accident location with respect to cloud movement.  Observations made from the facility during the hour before the accident indicated that the cloud ceiling lowered during that period to around 11,000 feet.  One Pilot Report (PIREPs) near Blythe, California, confirmed the presence of towering cumulus (TCU) in the area.  Radar and satellite data indicated that convective clouds were in the accident area and rapidly increasing in altitude with very strong vertical motion around the accident time.  In addition, deviations in the accident airplane's mode C altitude data just before the accident indicates that strong up- and downdrafts were present in the area.  Strong jet stream winds near 100 knots were present in the area about the height of the convective clouds.  Therefore, isolated strong convective downdrafts were possible in the area of the breakup.  While proceeding westbound, the airplane was probably in the vicinity of the northern edge of a rapidly developing convective buildup.

The helicopter was registered to and operated by PHI, Inc. Lafayette, Louisiana, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The commercial pilot and two paramedics received only minor injuries and the helicopter was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a company flight plan was filed for the local repositioning flight that was originating at the time of the accident. The pilot reported that he had completed all pre-takeoff hydraulic checks and that after liftoff, he commanded a slight left turn. However, the helicopter kept turning and entered a spin. The pilot added that the pedals were jammed or locked, in the neutral position. Video from a security camera mounted on the hospital helipad revealed that the helicopter began to yaw in a counterclockwise direction as it lifted off the helipad. The helicopter completed several rotations before it impacted the roof top, and came to rest adjacent the helipad. A small post-crash fire started, but was extinguished shortly after the helipad's fire suppression system activated. Examination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter came to rest on its right side. Several cuts/scars on the roof were consistent with impact from the main rotor blades or skids were observed. Continuity of the drive unit was confirmed throughout the tail rotor system; all major structural components of the helicopter were accounted for on scene. The wreckage was recovered from the hospital's roof top and transported to a secure location for further examination.",

Radar data showed that the airplane departed 23 minutes later. According to air traffic control data, shortly thereafter, the ground and departure controllers contacted the tower controller and asked if the airplane had departed yet; the tower controller responded, \u201cI have no idea. We have zero visibility.\u201d Weather conditions about the time of the accident included a 200-ft overcast ceiling with about 1/4-mile visibility.Only five radar targets identified as the accident airplane were captured, and all of the targets were located over airport property. The first three radar targets began about midpoint of the 6,500-ft-long runway, and each of these targets was at an altitude of about 60 ft above ground level (agl). The final two targets showed the airplane in a shallow right turn, consistent with the published departure procedure track, at altitudes of 161 and 261 ft agl, respectively. The final radar target was about 1/2 mile from the accident site. Witnesses reported observing the airplane impact trees in a wings-level, slightly right-wing-down attitude at high speed. Examination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies of the airplane.\u000b\u000bThe pilot\u2019s personal assistant reported that the pilot had an important meeting that required his attendance on the day of the accident flight. His early arrival to the airport and his request to have the airplane prepared for an immediate departure were actions consistent with self-induced pressure to complete the flight. Due to the poor weather conditions, which were expected to continue or worsen, he likely felt pressure to expedite his departure to ensure he was able to make it to his destination and to attend the meeting. This pressure may have further affected his ability to discern the risk associated with departing in low-visibility and low-ceiling conditions.\u000b\u000bAs noted, the weather conditions were so poor that the local air traffic controller stated that he could not tell whether the airplane had departed. Such weather conditions are highly conducive to the development of spatial disorientation. Further, the altitude profile depicted by the radar data and the airplane\u2019s near wings-level attitude and high speed at impact were consistent with the pilot experiencing a form of spatial disorientation known as \u201csomatogravic illusion,\u201d in which the pilot errantly perceives the airplane\u2019s acceleration as increasing pitch attitude, and efforts to hold the nose down or arrest the perception of increasing pitch attitude can exacerbate the situation. Such an illusion can be especially difficult to overcome because it typically occurs at low altitudes after takeoff, which provides little time for recognition and subsequent corrective inputs, particularly in very low-visibility conditions.\u000b",

Shortly after departure, during the initial climb, a witness saw the airplane in a steep turn, followed by the nose dropping, and the airplane entering a spin prior to impact. A flight instructor, familiar with accident type airplane, also saw it prior to impact, and said he thought the wing flaps were extended approximately 20 to 30 degrees. During the wreckage examination, the  wing flap indicator was found damaged, and read about 28 degrees down.  The flap actuator jackscrew measurement equated to flaps extended about 30 degrees.  A separate electrical supply was connected to the flap motor, bypassing the internal electrical circuits, and the motor was energized. The jackscrew successfully raised and lowered the flaps. The fuse for the electric flap motor was removed from the instrument panel. Beneath the fuse holder, the instrument panel was marked:  \"FLAPS   SLO-BLO.\"  The fuse had the markings: \"BUSS AGS 10\" on the side.  An examination of the fuse revealed that it was blown (nonfunctional). The Operators Manuel states:  \"Note: A special \"SLO-BLO\" fuse protects the wing flaps circuit.  If this fuse is replaced, care should be taken to assure that the replacement fuse is of the proper type and capacity.  A \"SLO-BLO\" fuse is identified by an integrally mounted spring encircling the fuse element.\"  Additionally, the manual calls for a SLO-BLO fuse rated for 15 amps.  On flap operation, the following is noted; \"Flap deflections of 30 and 40 degrees are not recommended at any time for take-off.\" An examination of the engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical anomalies that would have prevented normal operation. The gross weight of the airplane was estimated to be approximately 1,770 pounds, or about 170 pounds over the allowable gross weight.,  ",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor's failure to maintain sufficient airspeed to avoid a stall during takeoff-initial climb. Factors contributing to the accident are the instructor's decision to takeoff with excessive flaps, the improper maintenance replacement of the flap fuse, and the inability to raise the flaps due to a nonfunctional flap fuse."

He was advised that he was 4 miles from the nearest suitable airport. Air traffic control lost radar and communications with the pilot and the airplane crashed at the approach end of a runway at the airport. Visual examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2 connecting rod penetrated through the top of the aft section of the engine case. Examination of the accessory case revealed that a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SE5743NM Aviation Development Corporation oil filter adapter was attached to the accessory oil filter adapter fitting. A visual inspection of the oil filter adapter revealed that the O-ring between the mating surfaces was extruding 3/4 inch. Visual inspection of the O-ring revealed that it was leaking oil for an undetermined amount of time and was dry rotted and brittle. Review of the STC revealed that the O-ring was the incorrect part that was installed on the engine. A review of the engine and airframe logbooks did not reveal when the installation of the improper O-ring was performed. The engine had accumulated about 351 hours of operation since manufacture.",

The pilot initially decided to make an emergency landing in a field, but no suitable landing areas were found, and the helicopter's #2 engine was determined to be producing sufficient power to sustain flight.  The pilot therefore elected to continue the flight to the airport, and called the Medford tower and requested an emergency landing with fire crews standing by.  The medical crew on board the helicopter subsequently reported that they smelled \"something burning.\"   Approaching the airport, the Medford tower controller advised the pilot that the aircraft was trailing smoke, and subsequently advised the pilot that the helicopter was on fire.   The pilot elected to make a fast run-on landing, and subsequently landed on taxiway A at the airport.  The aircraft occupants evacuated the helicopter without injury, and ARFF successfully extinguished the fire.  The fire extensively damaged the helicopter's #1 engine compartment, engine cowling, outer surfaces of the #1 engine, and transmission compartment.  The fire also partially burned/melted through the main rotor flight control tubes, and molten metal and debris were ingested into the #1 engine compressor.  Post-accident examinations disclosed that the fire occurred in the #1 engine compartment, external to the #1 engine.  The #1 engine compartment contained puddles of oil on the pan below the engine, and the #1 engine oil tank was found to be empty.  The #1 engine oil out line (a line carrying oil from the engine accessory gearbox to the oil tank) was found to be leaking at a B-nut fitting at one end of the line.  Additionally, the engine's right exhaust stack and right exhaust extension were found to be cracked around portions of their circumference under a V-clamp.  Disassembly examination of the #1 engine N1 gas producer turbine assembly at the engine manufacturer's facilities disclosed that the first-stage nozzle and turbine wheel were burned consistent with exposure to excessive TOT, and that the second-stage nozzle and turbine wheel were generally intact.  Examination of the three main bearings located in the turbine assembly (Nos. 6, 7, and 8) disclosed that the number 8 bearing was oiled and rotated freely, the number 6 bearing was dry but intact and rotated freely, and that the number 7 bearing was dry and slightly notchy but was able to be rotated.  The Rolls-Royce accident investigation report concluded that \"There were no hardware failures on any part of the engine\", that \"The damages to the 1st stage nozzle and 1st stage turbine wheel were the result of operation at an excessive TOT\", and that \"The engine was operating with the external fire well advanced as evidenced by the ingestion of fire debris and molten metal into the compressor.\" ",

The pilot responded that he was going to stay below 1,900 feet and that he should be fine. The lineman recalled looking at the automated weather observing system monitor, and it was reporting 1,800-foot ceilings and 10 miles visibility locally. Witnesses reported that the airplane\u2019s takeoff and departure were normal. The lineman stated that the weather at the time was visual flight rules with light rain. The airplane was not captured on radar, and the pilot was not in radio contact with air traffic control. According to witnesses near the accident site, they heard the airplane flying overhead but did not see it due to heavy fog. One witness reported that shortly after hearing the aircraft overhead, he heard a loud splash in a nearby lake and, as he turned toward the lake, he saw a large spray of water. Shortly thereafter, a large amount of debris was observed in the water. About 30 minutes elapsed between the time the airplane took off and when it impacted the lake.The airplane was recovered from the lake and exhibited severe fragmentation, consistent with a steep, high-speed descent and impact. A postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

The intention was to perform a sightseeing flight, with multiple stops at backcountry airstrips. The flight instructor was carrying a personal locator device, which transmitted position data at 10-minute-intervals but no altitude information. This data revealed that the airplane landed at three airstrips. Shortly after the airplane departed the third airstrip about midafternoon, the instructor\u2019s personal locator began a series of transmissions all from the same location, about 1.2 miles from an unused airstrip. These transmissions continued from that location for about the next 12 hours; however, no emergency or alert notifications were received from the personal locator or the airplane\u2019s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) during that period. When the airplane had not returned to the original departure airport by nighttime, search and rescue efforts were initiated.  The wreckage was located in the early morning hours the next day on the edge of a plateau in remote wilderness, at an elevation of 6,900 feet mean sea level. The airplane wreckage came to rest on an uphill slope and was mostly consumed by postimpact fire. The terrain north and east of the accident site fell away to steep canyon walls, which descended to a confluence of rivers 1,500 feet below. Area weather conditions included low-level thermal activity, wind gusts, and light turbulence, which would have been further exasperated at the accident site due to the surrounding terrain. The flight instructor and the aft seat passenger were fatally injured on impact; however, the pilot sustained serious injuries and was able to extricate himself from the airplane. However, he eventually succumbed to his injuries before the airplane was discovered. Although the airplane was equipped with a 406-MHz ELT and evidence suggests that it activated during the accident, it had become separated from the airplane\u2019s structure (and thus its antenna) during the impact sequence, which limited its transmission range. As a result, no ELT transmissions were received by search and rescue (SAR) satellites. Had the ELT remained connected to its antenna, it would have effectively transmitted an alert signal, thereby providing SAR personnel with a rapid indication that an accident had occurred. Under such circumstances, the airplane would most likely have been discovered earlier, possibly during daylight hours.  The pilot's injuries fell within the \"severely\" injured category, and analysis of emergency evacuation and trauma treatment resources revealed that with prompt ELT notification, medical response would have been greatly augmented, and he may have survived the accident. Furthermore, although a personal locator device survived the accident intact, it was ejected from the airplane during the accident sequence and was not within easy reach of the pilot.",

The Cessna departed controlled flight after the collision, descended vertically in a spiral, and was destroyed by impact forces at ground contact. The Searey entered a descending right turn, and performed a forced landing to a thicket of low brush, and was substantially damaged. The commercial pilot and passenger on board the Cessna were fatally injured. The private pilot and passenger in the Searey were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for either airplane, each on local personal flights which departed BQR at 1009 (Seareay) and 1012 (Cessna), respectively. Both airplanes were participating in an Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Young Eagles event, and the flights were conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.Several witnesses provided statements, and their accounts were consistent throughout. They each said their attention was drawn to the sound of the airplanes and/or the sound of collision. The airplanes were both traveling westbound as one airplane overtook the other, or was on top of the other, before one airplane (Cessna) was seen to \"tip\" or \"roll\" inverted before it descended vertically in a spiral. The second airplane (Seareay) descended in a 180-degree turn and the sound of the engine was increasing and decreasing, \"revving\" or \"sputtering\" throughout the descent.Preliminary radar information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that both airplanes were assigned discrete transponder codes. The data depicted both airplanes traveling westbound on roughly the same ground track. The Cessna was at 1,774 feet and 90 knots groundspeed and the Searey was further west, at 1,575 feet and 70 knots groundspeed. As the Cessna approached the Searey from the east, it descended slowly to 1,625 feet. At the same time, the Searey climbed slowly to 1,625 feet. For the last few seconds of the Cessna's flight, both airplanes were depicted at 1,625 feet, and in close lateral proximity. Radar contact with the Cessna was suddenly lost in the vicinity of its accident site, while a descending right turn was depicted for the Searey.The 1054 weather observation at Buffalo International Airport (BUF), 5 miles west of the accident site included clear skies, calm winds, and 10 miles visibility.The Cessna came to rest on flat, wooded terrain and all major components of the airplane were accounted for at the scene. The airplane came to rest nose down with the engine buried beneath the instrument panel in the initial impact crater, and was severely deformed by impact forces. The leading edges of both wings were uniformly crushed aft in compression. Control continuity was established from the cockpit area to all flight control surfaces. Both propeller blades displayed similar twisting, bending, leading edge gouging and chordwise scratching. The Searey came to rest upright in a dense thicket. Examination of the airplane revealed that the trailing edge of the right wing flap displayed a series of parallel slash marks, and the structural tubing was severed, and the fracture surfaces were smeared. The structural cable between the wing strut and the empennage was still attached at each end, but missing a section about 5 feet in length in the middle. The two severed ends displayed features consistent with overload separation. The empennage displayed a vertical opening and parallel slash marks.",

He made the decision to do so because he heard pilots had reported some openings in the overcast layer that might allow him to descend through the clouds as he neared his destination. When he got near the destination, he discovered that there was no way through the overcast so he returned to the backcountry airstrip. The next day he decided to follow a group of pilots to the same planned destination, but by another route that he was not familiar with. When the other pilots started their engines, the accident  pilot realized that he had not yet dipped his fuel tanks to measure fuel quantity, and that the ladder that he needed to perform that function was under camping gear in the airplane. Therefore, so as not to get separated from the pilots he was going to follow en route, he elected to not sump the tanks prior to departure. As he approached the destination airport, one fuel gauge read empty, and the other read one-quarter, but its needle had stopped moving/bouncing, which the pilot thought was a, \"\u2026bad sign.\" Soon thereafter the engine lost all power, and although the pilot tried to stretch the glide to the destination airport, he ultimately had to make a forced landing in what appeared to be an open field.

The commercial pilot was not injured. The aerial application flight was being conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 without a flight plan. The local flight departed about 1400.According to the pilot he was conducting a spray pass when he lost elevator authority. As he was completing the spray pass, he closed the gate, pulled up, and detected that the elevator was not connected. The pilot was able to control the airplane with variable power settings and performed a forced landing to a field. The only visible damage to the airplane was impact damage to the propeller.",

He immediately reached down and turned the fuel selector from the \"left main\" tank to what he thought was the \"auxiliary\" tank position.  Subsequently, the engine stopped producing power.  He then switched the auxiliary fuel pump to the \"on\" position, thinking that the engine would resume running momentarily, but it did not.  The pilot then looked to the airport and realized that he would not be able to make it to the runway.  The pilot then began to look for a suitable location for a forced landing.  The pilot extended the airplane's landing gear and elected to land in an open pasture.  After touching down in the pasture, he observed a ditch in his path which he would not be able to avoid.

He landed and the maintenance facility did a post flight examination of the airplane for any discrepancies; none was observed.  The pilot elected to conduct a local flight to break in the engine.  The pilot did an engine run up, departure, and climb to 2500 feet, where he remained for a little over one hour.  While descending to traffic pattern altitude, he reduced the throttle and the engine lost power.  He then placed the throttle back to full power, turned on the electric fuel pump, checked the mixture was full rich, and attempted to restart the engine several times.  The pilot then realized he would not make the runway and made an off airport landing, incurring substantial damage to the airplane. When the FAA inspector and the mechanics arrived at the scene they inspected the aircraft visually for fuel and found no fuel in the right tank and 11 gallons in the left.  According to the pilot the fuel selector valve was on the right tank position at the time of engine failure. Examination of the fuel lines and fuel manifold revealed little fuel. The gascolator was about half full of fuel when removed. When fuel was drained from the right header tank very little fuel was observed. The engine was examined for a propeller strike and afterwards run on a test stand; no discrepancies were noted.",

            "narrative": "On August 19, 2015, about 2230 mountain daylight time, a Cessna 172P, N62731, collided with mountainous terrain during low altitude flight near Helena, Montana. The private pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed about the time of the accident, and a flight plan was not filed for the local flight. The flight originated from the Helena Regional Airport (HLN) at 2215 and was destined for White Sulphur Springs Airport (7S6), White Sulphur Springs, Montana. According to local law enforcement, the pilot contacted his wife about 2207 and subsequently departed for 7S6, with a family member onboard. The following morning Salt Lake Center recorded an electronic locator transmitter signal near Bozeman, Montana that was also picked up by a low flying aircraft. The pilot's flight instructor then initiated an aerial search and located the airplane about 0830 the day after the accident.The airplane impacted an area of rising mountainous terrain in a valley between two ridges at a terrain elevation of 5,046 feet. The initial impacted point (IIP) was identified by a green marking that resembled an aircraft position light located below an aluminum material transfer mark that spanned about 13 feet in length on a vertical rock face. The outboard section of the right wing was located at the base of the rock face about 30 feet from the IIP. Multiple sections of right wing were located in a tree that sat on a hillside about 30 feet beyond the IIP and surrounded by portions of the right wing and propeller at the base of the tree. Both the engine and left wing were located in the energy path about 20 feet from the tree, but before the main wreckage which was located about 20 feet beyond the engine at a lower elevation.An onsite examination of the airplane by the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge revealed that the airplane impacted right wing first and subsequently came to rest on the downhill slope about 70 feet from the IIP. The rudder, trim and elevator cables were traced from the cockpit to their respective control surfaces. Both the elevator trim tab actuator and aft chain were intact and in their original position within the horizontal stabilizer. The flap bell crank and jackscrew assembly had separated from the right wing and were found in the energy path about 30 feet from the main wreckage. The flap jackscrew measured 2.9\", consistent with a 10 degree flap position, which corroborated the flap indicator position. Both propeller blades were accounted for at the accident site and exhibited chordwise scratches, leading edge nicks, and bending. The 2153 recorded weather observation at HLN, located approximately 18 nautical miles west of the accident site, included winds from 250 degrees at 5 knots, visibility 5 statute miles, haze, an overcast cloud layer at 4,800 feet, temperature 22 degrees C, dew point 4 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.86 inches of mercury.The density altitude at the time of the accident from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was 7,192.1 feet. The pilot, age 59, held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land that was issued on September 30, 2014. A review of the logbook revealed that the pilot had accumulated a total of 280.4 flight hours; 276.9 of which were in the accident airplane make and model, and 3.8 were at night. The pilot accumulated a total of 0.8 night flight hours in the preceding 8 months.  ",

During an emergency descent/ landing, the pilot said he switched the fuel selector valve from one tank to the other.  During the landing roll, the engine power suddenly returned.  The right main landing gear tire struck a runway edge light fixture, and the right main gear collapsed, damaging the propeller and the right wing lift strut.  During recent maintenance, a mechanic had removed the fuel selector valve for lubrication and inspection.  The mechanic reported that he noticed the fuel valve shaft did not have an index shape to properly match the selector handle position, and consequently  was careful to reinstall the handle on the valve as he found it.  The mechanic performed about a 10 minute engine run after reinstalling the valve.  He said the pilot also ran the engine for about an additional 10 minutes before departure.  The fuel selector handle is attached to the valve shaft by a screw, and can be rotated 360 degrees.  The handle incorporates an arrow to provide visual reference for fuel tank selection that matches placard markings on a metal trim panel.  An examination of the airplane was conducted at a recovery facility by FAA personnel, 18 days after the accident.  Prior to the examination, the fuel valve handle and trim panel were removed by recovery personnel, but reportedly replaced in the position found before recovery.

The Cessna 185 was registered to and operated by Talkeetna Air Taxi, Inc., Talkeetna, Alaska as a visual flight rules (VFR) on-demand commercial air tour, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 135, when the accident occurred. The commercial pilot and three of the four passengers sustained no injuries, with the fourth passenger sustaining minor injuries. The Cessna 172 was registered to Artic's Air Academy, LLC and operated by the student pilot as a VFR cross-country flight under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91. The student pilot and sole occupant of the airplane sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area at the time of the accident. The Cessna 185 departed Talkeetna Airport about 1456 for a non-stop flight seeing tour around Denali National Park, and a VFR flight plan was on file. The Cessna 172 departed Palmer Airport, Palmer, Alaska, about 1625 destined for Talkeetna airport with no flight plan on file. After the collision, both airplanes remained joined together during and after impact with the ground. The debris field was about 460 feet long with the initial fragments located about 62 feet prior to the runway threshold. The main wreckage came to rest about five feet off of the left side of the runway. During a preliminary review of FAA Flight Service Station recordings of the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF), 123.6, both airplanes can be heard transmitting position reports in relation to the airport traffic pattern.The closest weather reporting facility is Talkeetna Airport.

The private pilot and student pilot were fatally injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to a private individual, and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91. Dark night conditions prevailed for the flight, and a visual flight rules flight plan had not been filed. The flight originated from Shively Field Airport about 2315.The pilot had called the airplane owner at 2306 Saturday night stating that he was in Saratoga and that he was preflighting in the dark. The airplane wreckage was found by a local rancher about 0815 Sunday morning, September 21. First responders confirmed both occupants were fatalities. The initial point of impact was a shallow 7-foot-long ground scar that contained green/blue lens fragments. The ground scar was oriented in direct line of the main wreckage on a magnetic bearing of 240 degrees. The main wreckage was located 130 feet from the initial point of impact on the same bearing. The airplane was upright oriented on a bearing of 212 degrees magnetic. The cockpit had split open behind the engine firewall; the left wing was attached, and the right wing had separated at the wing root.

After fueling the airplane, the pilot and passenger departed. A ground witness who is a pilot and former Federal Aviation Administration controller was in an automobile located near the destination airport and observed the airplane make a high and fast approach to runway 21. Unable to land, the pilot executed a go-around. The airplane returned for a second approach to runway 21, which was again flown high and fast and terminated in another go-around. The witness described the airplane's climb and left crosswind turn at the departure end of the runway with a pitch attitude of 45 degrees nose up and the airplane's left bank angle about 60 degrees. The witness stated that he lost sight of the airplane and came upon the crash site next to the road on which he was traveling. The airplane was oriented in a northerly direction. The witness reported that the wind, which he estimated at 5 knots, was also coming from a northerly direction. The accident airplane was found on near level soil about 1/4-mile southeast of the departure end of runway 21. The airplane was in a nose-down attitude, with the engine buried in the sandy soil to an estimated  1-foot depth at about a 45 degree angle. Crush deformation and ground scars were consistent with a stall/spin loss of control. The pilot's route of flight between the departure airport and the destination could not be determined; however, a more or less direct flight would be about 30 minutes.Except for the magnetos, examination of the wreckage disclosed no evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure in the airframe or core engine components. Both magnetos had been displaced from their respective mounting pads. When the left magneto was removed, investigators noted that the castellated nut, washer, and cotter pin that secure the magneto drive gear and impulse coupler were missing. The respective threads on the shaft were undamaged, indicating that the nut was not mechanically forced off of the shaft but that it backed off during operation. The nut and associated washer were found in the oil sump, but the cotter pin was not located. The magneto drive gear that attaches to the subject magneto shaft, which is an engine part and must be installed onto the magneto when it is installed on the engine, exhibited no visible witness marks on the inside bore. Witness marks would have been present if the cotter pin had been in place and worked its way out of the castellated nut and shaft during operation of the engine. The rear of the engine case within the accessory section, which corresponds to the location of the magneto drive gear, exhibited a rotational burnishing signature consistent with having prolonged contact with the subject gear while the engine was operating. In addition to these observations, metal particles were found in the oil filter, all of which indicate that the airplane was operated with the improperly assembled drive gear for a sustained period of time.The left magneto sustained impact damage that precluded functional testing. The right magneto \u201cE-gap\u201d was found to be excessively out of the manufacturer\u2019s specifications during the examination; however, the magneto produced a weak spark during hand rotation of the drive. The internal magneto timing was 34 degrees \u00b1 1.5 degrees. According to the magneto manufacturer, \u00b1 5 degrees is the normal allowable range for internal timing. With the timing noted during the examination, the right magneto would produce a spark, but it would be very weak and negatively affect the power production of the engine.The maintenance history documents multiple instances of magneto maintenance, removal and replacement, and timing adjustments--particularly to the left magneto--during the 2-year period between the engine\u2019s overhaul and installation in August 2007 and the accident. In general, the historical review found that the magneto timing had to be adjusted at roughly 50-hour intervals, which is indicative of the operator\u2019s maintenance personnel chasing the internal magneto timing issues by timing the magneto to the engine instead of resolving the internal malfunction. An August 8, 2009, entry in the flight department rental log sheet for the accident airplane lists a pilot report of an rpm drop of 225 when the left magneto was tested during the runup procedure before a flight.  According to the Cessna Pilot's Operating Handbook for this airplane, the maximum allowed rpm drop on either magneto is 125. Review of the aircraft and maintenance department records found no corresponding maintenance record in response to the pilot-reported discrepancy.It is likely that the internal timing issues found with both magnetos resulted in weak ignition spark outputs that would negatively affect the power production of the engine but not necessarily produce a condition, such as prolonged roughness, that would alert the pilot to a potentially serious problem. Since the pilot flew about 30 minutes to the vicinity of the airport, the castellated nut securing the drive gear to the magneto shaft in the left magneto probably loosened sufficiently to free the gear from engagement on the shaft. Once the gear was liberated, the left magneto would not have functioned, leaving the weak right magneto as the only source of ignition spark, which would have presented itself as a serious partial loss of power. During the pilot\u2019s ensuing attempts to land at the airport, he inadvertently stalled the airplane while maneuvering in the pattern.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering in the traffic pattern, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall/spin. Also causal was the failure of the left magneto due to improper assembly of the drive gear during installation on the engine, and the improper internal timing of the right magneto due to inadequate maintenance that reduced the ability of the magneto to produce an adequate spark, resulting in a partial loss of engine power."

The airplane flipped over during the force landing.  A post recovery wreckage examination was performed.  The presence of fuel was observed and no discrepancies were noted with the airplane\u2019s fuel system. A five minute engine run was accomplished with no discrepancies noted.

A witness who observed the airplane stated that after the airplane bounced back in the air, the pilot lowered the nose and appeared to be attempting to land again.  The airplane disappeared from his view and was followed by the sound of increasing engine power.  Examination of the airplane did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.
