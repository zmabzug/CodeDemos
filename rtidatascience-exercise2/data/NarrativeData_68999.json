The pilot reported that he checked the fuel in the right wing fuel tank for contaminants, then after noticing the tank was 1/2 full, 5 gallons of 100 low lead fuel were added to the tank.  He did not report checking the fuel tank for contaminants after fueling.  He performed a preflight to the airplane but later advised the FAA inspector-in-charge (FAA-IIC) that he did not know the airplane had a gascolator installed, and as such, did not check it during the preflight.  He started the engine by hand propping it, and after starting, ran the engine for 5 or 6 minutes before securing it due to no indication on the amp meter.  The discrepancy was traced to the alternator and it was suggested that the pilot fly the airplane for 1 hour to see if the alternator started working as the airplane had been sitting for 4 months.  The pilot was also advised to do some idle taxiing and step taxiing to get the feel for the airplane he had just purchased.  The airplane was pushed into the water, the engine was started, and the pilot idle taxied the airplane 5-10 minutes, then did 2 step taxis up and down the lake.  He applied power to 1,800 rpm and checked the magnetos and carburetor heat; no discrepancies were reported.  He verified the carburetor heat was off, and proceeded to takeoff.  At 200-300 feet before reaching the end of the lake, the engine quit.  He was unable to attempt a restart due to not having electrical power available, but pumped the throttle in an attempt to restore engine power; the results were unsuccessful.  With insufficient lake available to land ahead, he initiated a 180-degree turn, and after completing the turn, flared when the airplane was 10 feet above the water.  He reported, \"I think I stalled the aircraft at about 20 feet with a slight right wing down.\"  The airplane impacted the water right wing low, which damaged the wing.  The airplane was towed to the public jetty, then removed from the water and transported to a nearby facility for further examination.  He further reported there was no mechanical failure or malfunction, and he noted a low point in the fuel system beneath the floor boards which prevented water from reaching the gascolator.  Several witnesses reported hearing either a sputtering engine or rough running engine after the airplane became airborne; both reported the engine then quit.  One of the witnesses who is a pilot reported that after the engine quit, the pilot turned from the northwest to the south, and the pilot began \"roundout to level off unusually high (approx 40 feet above water surface.  The aircraft stalled [approximately 10 feet off the water resulting in right wing drop.\"  Post accident examination of the recovered airplane by an FAA airworthiness inspector revealed the gascolator was approximately 1/2 full of water; the carburetor bowl was not examined.  The engine was removed from the airplane, placed on a test stand, and found to operate normally.  According to the president of the facility that fueled the airplane last, no contaminants were noted in post accident fuel samples taken from the fuel nozzle under pressure, or fuel filter.

The pilot, who held an airline transport pilot certificate, received minor injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was not on a flight plan. The flight was originating at the time of the accident and was destined for the San Antonio International Airport (SAT), San Antonio, Texas.The pilot reported that the accident flight was the first flight following an annual inspection of the airplane. He stated that he performed a pre-flight inspection of the airplane that included checking fuel, oil, and the replacement and securing of access panels. He stated that both of the engines started immediately and that pre-takeoff checks were normal. On takeoff the pilot noted that all of the engine instrument readings were normal with the exception of the fuel flow for the right engine. The reading was 17 gallons per hour versus the 14 gallon per hour reading expected. After becoming airborne, the fuel flow on the right engine remained the same and the engine RPM was at maximum. Under these conditions the right engine exhaust gas temperature (egt) was about 100 degrees lower than that of the left engine. He noted that his experience with the airplane was that the egt readings were normally very close to the same. He retarded the propeller control lever with no resulting change. Cycling the prop lever had no effect and he decided to return to 7F7. As he turned onto a downwind traffic pattern leg, the right engine suddenly stopped with no warning. He was unable to restart or feather the failed right engine. During the ensuing forced landing, about 20 ft above ground level, the airplane suddenly and violently rolled to the right. The airplane traveled across the taxiway parallel to the runway, onto the ramp, and came to rest behind a row of buildings on the southwest side of the runway. During the event, the airplane struck another airplane that was parked on the ramp area of the airport.

The weather worsened, and the pilot decided to divert. When the surviving passenger looked out of the window, it was \u201cmisty and dusky.\u201d Shortly after, the helicopter struck trees and terrain. A witness reported observing the helicopter flying \u201cvery low\u201d along the southbound lane of an interstate with all of its lights on just before the accident. He stated that the visibility was low, that the helicopter was under \u201clow fog,\u201d and that it was like \u201cpea soup\u201d around the area.\u000b\u000bReview of meteorological and GPS information indicated that dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) existed in the accident area. Light rain was present, and low instrument flight rules conditions existed with vertical visibility of 200 feet and variable visibility of 1/2 mile. Before the accident, the helicopter was flying through this area of weather at a low altitude and an airspeed of about 30 knots. Although the pilot could have returned to the departure airport or landed in a suitable area along his route of flight, he chose to enter IMC despite the availability of safer options and was then forced to divert as the weather worsened. Also, once the helicopter had entered the weather, the sun had already set and minimal ground lighting was present in the heavily wooded area surrounding the interstate. Therefore, it is unlikely that a discernable horizon was present, which would have significantly increased the pilot\u2019s workload because it would have required him to reference the helicopter\u2019s flight instruments to maintain the helicopter\u2019s attitude, flightpath, energy state, and altitude. \u000b\u000bFuel was found onboard the helicopter, and no evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction of the helicopter, drivetrain, or engine was found that would have precluded normal operation. Review of data recorded by the engine control unit revealed no hard faults or engine operational issues before the beginning of the accident sequence. Recorded data further indicated that the engine was running during the impact sequence and continued to operate for an additional 21 minutes following the accident while the helicopter was resting on its right side, which resulted in reduced oil flow and lubrication to the engine and the eventual postimpact failure of the turbine main line bearings and rotatable parts. \u000b\u000bAlthough the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate that allowed him to fly under IMC in airplanes, he did not possess an instrument helicopter rating. Review of information provided by the helicopter manufacturer revealed no evidence that the pilot had received any inadvertent IMC or instrument flight rules helicopter training when he was at its training center. Examination of the pilot\u2019s flight- and duty-time records also revealed that he was scheduled to fly a round trip for the airline he worked for the day after the accident occurred, which likely resulted in self-imposed pressure to complete the trip he was flying on the day of the accident so that he could return home and make his report time for his assigned trip on the following day.",

The private pilot and a passenger were fatally injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the flight destined for Eagle Neck Airport (1GA0), Shellman Bluff, Georgia. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The airplane was owned by the pilot and his wife, and based at FFC. The pilot and his wife also owned a home in a residential community at 1GA0. According to pilot's wife, the pilot and the passenger, who was her brother, intended to fly to 1GA0 to attend a homeowner's association meeting that was scheduled to begin at 0800.A witness at the FFC, who was a pilot and air traffic controller, stated that he observed a small single engine airplane depart from runway 13, shortly after 0545. The airplane leveled off about 100 to 200 feet above the ground and continued to fly on runway heading, before he lost sight of it. He further stated that visibility at the time was \"somewhat restricted\" due to patchy areas of fog or mist, and he estimated the ceiling was about 300 to 400 feet.A witness, who lived about 3 miles from the end of runway 13 stated that he observed a very low flying airplane about 0600. The airplane was flying about 30 to 40 feet above the tree line and the engine noise sounded normal. He lost sight of the airplane and recalled hearing a \"thud,\" shortly thereafter. At the time, he did not consider that the airplane may have crashed and was not aware of the accident until hearing a news report. He described the weather conditions at the time he observed the airplane as \"humid and rather foggy.\" The airplane was subsequently found in a wooded area about 3.5 miles southeast of FFC, adjacent to a gravel road. The airplane's initial impact point was a berm on the side of the road. Debris was strewn for about 80 feet, on a heading about 240 degrees, and the airplane came to rest nose down, in trees facing the opposite direction of the debris path. All major components of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. The left wing was separated from the fuselage and contained leading edge compression damage approximately mid-span and was crushed in a tapering fashion toward the left wing tip. The empennage was separated and remained attached via control cables. The right wing remained attached to the center wing section at the aft attachment bolt and was fractured into two pieces at approximately mid-span. The engine remained partially attached to the airframe firewall via engine mounts and various lines, cables and hoses. The propeller, both magnetos, starter, vacuum pump, and carburetor separated from the engine and exhibited impact damage. The propeller was located about 65 feet from the initial impact point and remained attached to the crankshaft flange, which separated from the crankshaft. The propeller blades displayed chord-wise scratches, leading edge gouges, and \"S-bending.\"A handheld global positioning system receiver was recovered from the cockpit and forwarded to the National Transportation Safety Board's Vehicle Recorder Laboratory, Washington, DC, for download.The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land, which was issued on May 16, 2014.

The airplane departed from it's home base airport at 0740 for a presumed local area flight and was reported overdue on the morning of the 15th when the passenger failed to return home.  The FAA issued an ALNOT for the missing airplane and it was found by a search helicopter at 1641 that afternoon.  Witnesses who knew the pilot stated that he liked to land in the open desert on \"sand dunes\" on the large sized tundra tires he had equipped the airplane with that were designed to be used on soft unimproved surfaces.   Several entries in the pilot's personal flight logbook contained notes of \"practice short and soft landings in dirt.\"  Weather data showed that during the morning hours of the 14th the conditions remained clear with generally southerly winds at less than 10 knots.  No unusual meteorological phenomena were reported during this time.  The accident site is in flat desert terrain composed of firm sandy soil and populated by scrub type trees up to 10 feet tall.  Examination of the trees surrounding the accident site revealed no evidence of disturbance to any upper branches or trunks.  The airplane sustained extensive longitudinal crush and collapse of the fuselage back to within 3 feet of the horizontal stabilizers.  Ground scar impressions were noted about 15 feet from the wreckage that dimensionally and geometrically resembled the nose of the airplane and the left wing tip.  No other ground disturbances were observed in the vicinity.  The engine was in a shallow crater formed in the impact sequence with the engine's longitudinal axis at a 30-degree angle to the horizontal.  No pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures were found with any airframe system or the engine.  About 1/2 mile southwest of the wreckage, a large flat clear area was noted with multiple tire tracks crossing the field.  The tire tracks were dimensionally similar to the main gear tires on the airplane and were spaced about the wheel width of the PA-18 series airplanes.  Two sets of tracks were found with a center track approximating the geometry and dimension of the airplane's tail wheel; these tracks started, went for a distance estimated about 500 feet, where they turned around and proceeded back the opposite way until they disappeared.  Two additional tracks were observed without the center track trace; these tracks were shorter in length at about 200 feet.  No footprints could be discerned around any of the tracks.

The pilot reported that he initiated a spin beginning about 3,000 feet above ground level.  Once the aircraft entered the spin, he counted 2 full revolutions and then \"centered the stick and rudder pedals\" for recovery. However, the aircraft continued to spin.  The pilot stated that he held neutral control positions for an additional 6 to 8 revolutions, at which time he elected to apply opposite (right) rudder and control stick inputs.  The opposite control inputs had no effect and the aircraft continued the left spin.  The pilot noted that he next applied full engine power for \"about 2 or 3 seconds and it felt like it had no effect.\"  The pilot noted:  \"As I got closer to the ground I again went neutral on the controls and I don't know why but the plane stopped spinning, I pulled the stick full back to pull out but I was [too] close to the ground.  I estimate I was 40 to 50 feet agl when I went into the trees.  I think I bounced off several trees before the plane hit the ground.\"  The Federal Aviation Administration publication Airplane Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3, stated that spin recoveries should be initiated by reducing engine power to idle, neutralizing the aileron position, applying full opposite rudder against the rotation of the spin, and providing a \"positive and brisk\" forward movement of the control stick to break the stall.  The handbook noted that \"aileron control opposite the direction of the spin may . . . aggravate the situation.

The commercial pilot and one of the passengers were seriously injured, while another passenger sustained minor injuries. A pilot-rated passenger was fatally injured. Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed. No flight plan was filed for the flight, from St. Mary's Airport (2W6), Maryland, to Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Atlantic City, New Jersey; however, approaching Atlantic City, the pilot requested and received an instrument flight rules clearance. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, the purpose of the flight was to attend a local area airshow the next day. Prior to the flight, he checked the weather via internet and called ACY Tower several times to check its progress. He was aware of potential low visibilities and his alternate plan should he not be able to land at ACY was to either fly to an airport in Millville, New Jersey, or return home.The pilot initially completed an ILS 13 approach to ACY; however, due to the low visibility, he could not complete the landing and flew a missed approach. The controller offered another approach, which he accepted. Commencing the second approach, the pilot was advised of the current weather [controller reported a 200-foot overcast, \u00bc-mile visibility in fog], and knew then that he had no chance of completing the approach. He requested vectors to Millville, and was told to climb to 2,000 feet. He added full power, and the engine \"stopped\" with the pilot perceiving either a fuel or an electrical problem. Once the engine quit, the pilot moved the fuel selector through various positions, then checked the ignition, throttle and mixture.The pilot also stated that the fuel gauges were inaccurate and that he checked the fuel quantity in both tip tanks and the main tanks prior to the flight using a calibrated stick. Both tip tanks had 10 gallons each while the main tanks had slightly over 15 gallons total. In addition, and as was normal procedure, he ran the engine for 3 minutes on the ground from each tip tank to ensure proper tip tank feed. The pilot further noted that he always took off and landed on main fuel tanks and utilized the tip tanks in transit. On this flight he utilized the left tip tank for 22 minutes, 40 seconds and was certain of the time due to using a stopwatch. He utilized the main tanks for the first approach and after the missed, switched to the right tip tank. About 1 minute before the engine quit, he switched from right tip tank to the main tanks again.The pilot also advised that the boost pump was utilized for start and could be used during approach and takeoff. In addition, when utilizing tip tanks in cruise flight, it was normal to run a tip tank out of fuel. At that point, the main tank would be selected, and the engine would return to operating 5-10 seconds later. He further noted that the airplane was recently flown several legs round trip to the Atlanta, Georgia, area, and during the last flight, when he ran a tip tank dry, it seemed that the engine took a little longer than normal to return to running. The wreckage was located in a flat, wooded area the vicinity of 39 degrees, 28.26 minutes north latitude, 074 degrees, 39.03 minutes west longitude. Tops of pine trees were cut in a descending path, with an estimated descent angle of 20 to 30 degrees, heading about 140 degrees magnetic for an estimated 200 feet. The tree cuts suddenly stopped about an estimated 60 feet above the ground in the vicinity of the wreckage location; there were no ground scars leading up to the wreckage. The airplane came to rest about on its left side, about 45-degrees nose down/tail up. The fuselage was mostly intact; however, both wings were separated from the airplane about 2 feet from their roots and the empennage was separated from the fuselage.All flight control surfaces were found at the scene, and flight control continuity was confirmed to the cockpit.The left fuel tip tank was compromised. No fuel was found in it, nor was there an odor of fuel in the soil beneath it. Utilizing the calibrated stick, the right tip tank had about 5 gallons of fuel in it, and the connected main tanks had about 15 gallons of fuel in them. About 10 gallons of fuel were drained from the main tanks, with additional fuel remaining in the tanks. The propeller did not exhibit any chordwise scratching or leading edge damage that would have been consistent with the presence of engine power.

The audio information extracted from the CVR indicated the flight crew listened to the automated weather station at the airport twice during the second approach; both times the report stated, in part, \"visibility one half [mile] light snow sky conditions ceiling two hundred broken one thousand overcast.\" At 0744:09, the first officer said, \"there's MDA,\" and at 0744:27, \"there's the runway right below ya.\" The CVR recorded the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) audio alert \"sink rate, sink rate, sink rate, sink rate\" at 0744:37, the sound of touchdown at 0744:52, and the sound of impact at 0745:00. According to both pilots, the airplane touched down even with the midfield windsock.  The captain applied brakes and full reverse on both propellers; however, the airplane did not slow down and continued off the end of the runway, impacted and knocked down a chain link fence, and continued into downsloping rough terrain. The landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a stop. The operator reported that there was 2 to 3 inches of slush on the runway. The runway was equipped with pilot activated medium intensity runway lights, runway end identifier lights, and a visual approach slope indicator. The first officer said that on both approaches, he attempted to turn on the lights, but the lights did not activate. The Federal Aviation Regulation that specifies the instrument flight rules for takeoff and landing states, in part, that no pilot may operate an aircraft below the authorized MDA unless (1) the aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers, and (2) the flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed in the standard instrument approach being used. The regulation further states that if these conditions are not met when the aircraft is being operated below the MDA or upon arrival at the missed approach point, the pilot shall immediately execute an appropriate missed approach procedure. In this case, the minimum required visibility was 1 mile versus the 1/2-mile visibility reported by the automated weather station.  Additionally, the activation of the GPWS \"sink rate\" audio alert indicates a normal rate of descent was exceeded during the landing.  Both of these conditions should have prompted the flight crew to execute a missed approach, which would have prevented the accident.",

The commercial pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed Bob Sikes Airport (CEW), Crestview, Florida, about 1450, and was destined for Florala Municipal Airport (0J4), Florala, Alabama. The personal flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The purpose of the flight was to relocate the airplane from CEW to 0J4, where it could be stored in a hangar while the pilot traveled overseas. When the pilot attempted to complete the flight the day prior to the accident, he found that the airplane would not start. Attempts to jump-start the airplane were unsuccessful, the pilot requested that a mechanic at the fixed-base operator troubleshoot and repair the airplane so that the flight could be completed. The morning of the accident, the mechanic serviced the airplane's battery with fluid, placed it on a charger, and reinstalled it in the airplane. He then successfully started the engine and performed a run-up check. A lineman reported that the pilot arrived at CEW between 1400 and 1430 on the day of the accident. He observed as the pilot boarded the airplane, started the engine, and taxied the airplane to the runway for takeoff. He described the pilot's pre-takeoff engine run-up as unusually long, and stated that the pilot would typically \"hop in and go.\"A witness located near the accident site observed the airplane circling over his home, and stated that the engine sounded as though it was revving up and down. As the airplane descended and flew towards a nearby field, he heard the engine \"popping\" and saw it trailing smoke.

During the approach, the pilot maintained a manifold pressure of about 12 inches, so that the engine would still be producing a small amount of power, and the throttle would not be completely closed. When the airplane reached a height of about 100 feet above the ground, the pilot moved the throttle partially forward in order to execute a go-around, but the engine rpm did not increase. The pilot then pushed the throttle full forward, but the propeller continued to only windmill. By the time the pilot determined that the engine had lost all power, it was too late to put the airplane down on the grass strip. The pilot therefore elected to make an emergency landing in a field past the departure end of the grass strip. The field where the airplane touched down was rough and uneven, and covered with high vegetation. About 15 feet beyond where the main landing gear came in contact with the terrain, the structure inside the right main landing gear attachment box failed, and the right main landing gear leg collapsed. When the right main gear leg collapsed, the right wing came in contact with the terrain. During a post-accident inspection of the airplane and engine, no anomalies could be found that would have lead to a loss of power. After the inspection, the Continental Motors IO-0470-F engine was started and run without any malfunction detected.  ",

The departure airport's automated weather observation system was reporting skies clear to 12,000 feet above ground level (agl), with winds from 220 degrees at 14 knots gusting to 26 knots at the estimated time of departure.  The pilot received a weather briefing 1 hour 46 minutes prior to departure.  He was informed that the winds at 9,000 feet mean sea level (msl) over the area were 210 degrees at 50 knots, and that conditions would get worse by 1100.  The briefing also contained AIRMETS for mountain obscuration, moderate turbulence, and moderate rime and mixed icing above the freezing level.  The accident site elevation was approximately 10,300 feet msl.  The airplane approached the accident site on a heading of approximately 240 degrees.  This would have placed the airplane on the lee side of a high ridgeline with winds exceeding 50 knots.  There was a valley extending towards the southwest directly in front of and 90 degrees to the ridgeline on which the airplane crashed. This valley may have produced a funneling effect, which would have significantly accelerated the wind flow over the ridge.  Satellite imagery of the site at the time of the accident showed high clouds above the mountains.  The cloud tops were estimated to be 13,000 feet.  Additionally, rotor clouds could be seen southwest of the crash site.  Studies have shown that severe turbulence, wind shear, and downdrafts are commonly found on the downwind side of high mountainous terrain when high wind conditions exist.  The maximum climb rate for the airplane at 9,000 feet under static conditions was calculated to be 900 feet per minute.  No preimpact mechanical malfunctions were found during examination of the wreckage. ",

About 4 minutes later, the pilot reported that he had shut down the right engine. The pilot orbited around the diversion airport during the descent and reported to an air traffic controller that he did not believe he would require any assistance after landing. The airplane initially approached the airport while descending through about 17,000 feet mean sea level (msl) and circled above the airport before entering a left traffic pattern approach for runway 22. About 7,000 feet msl, the airplane was about 2.5 miles northeast of the airport. The airplane descended through 2,300 feet msl when it was abeam the runway threshold on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern. According to the airplane information manual, procedures for landing with an inoperative engine call for \u201cexcessive altitude;\u201d however, the airplane's last radar return showed the airplane at an altitude of 700 feet msl (about 600 feet above ground level) and about 3 miles from the approach end of the runway. The airplane was configured for a single-engine landing and was likely on or turning to the final approach course when it rolled and impacted trees. The airplane came to rest in a wooded area about 0.8 miles north of the runway threshold, inverted, in a flat attitude with no longitudinal deformation. A majority of the airplane, including the cockpit, main cabin, and left wing, were consumed by a postcrash fire. Search operations located the airplane about 6 hours after its expected arrival time. Due to the severity of the postcrash fire, occupant survivability after the impact could not be determined. Examination of the airframe, the left engine, and both propellers did not reveal any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The investigation revealed that the right engine failed when the camshaft stopped rotating after the camshaft gear experienced a fatigue fracture on one of its gear teeth. The remaining gear teeth were fractured in overstress and/or were crushed due to interference contact with the crankshaft gear.

Therefore, the overspeed governor would have been controlling the system.  Manufacturing flight test documents indicate four occasions when the maximum reverse rpm was adjusted.  Flight tests conducted with the governors calibrated to the settings at the time of the accident were conducted.  Data from the flight tests indicate the propeller rpm was limited between 96-97% and that changes in the rpm stabilized within seconds.  ",

The pilot was uninjured.  The pilot said he felt he had the runway made and set up for a slightly wide base leg to lose excess altitude.  He said that on final, the approach looked good but slightly high, so he lowered 10 degrees of flaps.  He stated that it then appeared the glide was going to be short.  The pilot further said, 'Realizing I would not make the runway I banked slightly to the left in an attempt to land in the soybean field east of the corn field I was over.  Just before impact I flared slightly and the aircraft struck the corn field and nosed over, landing on its back.  I was uninjured and exited the aircraft.'  A Federal Aviation Administration inspector performed an on-scene examination of the wreckage.  The inspector's report states, 'Prior to engine test run and after aircraft was turned right side up, approximately one teaspoon of water was drained from sumps.  Possible fuel contamination suspected.  Static engine test run was satisfactory.' ",

The captain reported that as he taxied into the gate area at a normal speed, he observed the lead-in line, a parked fuel truck on the right side, the jet bridge on the left side, and the marshaller. He felt confident the airplane could proceed to the gate and clear all of the obstacles. As he continued to taxi, he anticipated the marshaller shortly giving the stop signal and chose to maintain visual attention on the marshaller. Just as the marshaller raised his hands to perform the stop signal, the left propeller struck the jet bridge. The first officer reported that he was looking out the right side of the airplane to make sure everything was clear of the wing and propeller. He reported that he never saw the jet bridge on the left side. He turned his attention back to the marshaller and saw his arms moving up indicating they were close to stopping. Before the marshaller crossed his day wands to indicate the stop location, the first officer felt something hit the airplane. The marshaller reported that he was concentrating on the airplane\u2019s right side where a fuel truck was parked close to the envelope line and was concerned about the truck\u2019s proximity to the airplane. Because of where his attention was focused, he misjudged the stop line marked for EMB airplanes and instead signaled  the airplane to stop on the line marked for CRJ airplanes. Just as he crossed his wands, the left engine propeller struck the jet bridge. Postaccident examination of the airplane and surrounding parking area revealed that the airplane\u2019s nosewheel tire came to rest about 18 feet beyond the stop line marked \u201cEMB,\u201d at a line marked \u201cRJ50.\u201d A reenactment of the incident, accomplished by towing an airplane on the taxi line toward the RJ50 stop line, determined that the flight crew had a clear view of the surroundings associated with the gate, including the jet bridge, when both occupants turned to look out the left cockpit window. In addition, it was also determined that the captain would be able to see part of the left engine and propeller as the airplane approached the jet bridge just prior to the RJ50 stop line.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight crew\u2019s failure to maintain clearance from the jet bridge during taxi. Contributing to the incident was the ramp marshaller's diverted attention and failure to signal the flight crew to stop at the correct position. "
