After several attempts, while conferring with the checklist and company personnel, the flightcrew performed an emergency landing with the unsafe landing gear indication.  During the landing, the right main landing gear slowly collapsed, and the airplane came to rest off the right side of the runway.  Examination of the right main landing gear revealed that the retract actuator fitting was secured with two fasteners, a smaller bolt, and a larger bolt.  The nut and cotter key were not recovered with the smaller bolt, and 8 of the 12 threads on the smaller bolt were stripped consistent with an overstress pulling of the nut away from the bolt.  The larger bolt was bent and separated near the head, consistent with a tension and overstress separation as a result of the smaller bolt failure.  The overstress failures were consistent with the right main landing gear not being locked in the extended position when aircraft weight was applied; however, examination of the right main landing gear down lock system could not determine any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  Further, the right main landing gear retract actuator was tomography scanned, and no anomalies were noted.   The unit was then functionally tested at the manufacturer's facility, under the supervision of an FAA inspector.  The unit tested successfully, with no anomalies noted.",

A company VFR flight plan was filed.  Radar data shows the helicopter departed the hospital, proceeded northbound over ocean water, following the coastline at an altitude of approximately 800 feet msl.  Just prior to the loss of radar contact, the helicopter entered a left turn towards the west, away from the shoreline.  No eye witnesses to the accident were located.  A number of ear witnesses heard a low flying helicopter and then the sound of impact.  The witnesses reported low clouds and restricted visibility in rain, mist and fog in the vicinity of the accident site.  The closest aviation weather reporting station, located 5 miles northwest of the accident site, reported winds from the southwest at 6 knots, with visibilities restricted in light rain and mist, with a ceiling ranging from 200 to 800 feet.  Conditions rapidly deteriorated within 30 minutes of the accident, with visibilities lowering to 1/4 miles in dense fog with ceilings at 200 feet.  Plotting the helicopter's flight track on weather radar images indicates the helicopter encountered an area of light precipitation as it approached the accident site.  The pilot was instrument rated and met the currency requirements for IFR flight, and the helicopter was equipped and certified for IFR flight.  The pilot had been employed as an air ambulance helicopter pilot in the accident area for the past 16 years.

Examination of the helicopter's maintenance records revealed no evidence of any uncorrected maintenance discrepancies.  Damage observed on the recovered wreckage was consistent with the helicopter impacting the water in an uncontrolled descent.  Examination of the recovered wreckage revealed no evidence suggesting mechanical malfunction or failure.

The flight instructor informed him that the fuel gauges were often faulty and that they had enough fuel to complete the return leg of the flight. About 2 miles from the destination, the helicopter yawed left twice, and the engine and rotor rpm began to decay. The instructor lowered the collective and leveled the helicopter. The rotor rpm decayed even further, to the point that it was below the minimum for autorotative descent. The instructor pushed the nose over then brought the helicopter back to a level attitude. He reported that this caused the blades to cone upward and increased the rotor rpm, but the rpm was still below the red line.

One witness reported that when he saw the accident airplane fly over 100-foot-tall trees north of him at an altitude of about 200 feet above ground level, the engine sounded normal. However, when he looked away from the airplane momentarily, he heard the engine stop. He immediately looked back and saw the airplane descend into the 100-foot tall trees. A portable electronic device was located in the wreckage, and it contained a 23-second video that was recorded during the accident flight and ended just before the airplane impacted the trees. Review of the video revealed that it began as the airplane initiated the takeoff roll on the grass runway. The video briefly captured the engine tachometer gauge, which displayed 2,300 rpm. Throughout the video, the engine sound was consistent and did not increase or decrease. During the final 8 seconds of the video, after the airplane became airborne, a sound similar to a stall warning horn began and was heard until the end of the recording. During the last 4 seconds of the video, only the sky and the airplane\u2019s propeller were visible.  Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine and a postaccident engine run revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation. The throttle control was found in the idle position and was bent downward. Given the idle position of the throttle and downward bend, it is likely that the pilot reduced power before the airplane collided with the trees. The sound of the stall warning horn in the video suggests that the airplane was traveling at a slow airspeed immediately after takeoff and most likely continued in this state throughout the climb. Although witnesses reported hearing the engine lose power, it is possible that the witnesses heard the reduction of engine power from a high power setting to an idle power setting before the airplane\u2019s impact with trees and attributed the sound to a loss of engine power.Toxicology tests on the pilot were found positive for metabolites of marijuana within the pilot\u2019s blood and lung tissue. Most behavioral and physiological effects return to baseline levels within 3-5 hours after drug use, although some residual effects in specific behaviors have been demonstrated up to 24 hours, such as complex divided attention tasks. Psychomotor impairment can persist after the perceived high has dissipated. Although the pilot\u2019s use of marijuana may have affected his ability to successfully manage this flight, use likely occurred more than 5 hours before the accident, and the exact degree of impairments in cognition, judgment, and motor function could not be determined.

During the accident flight, both fuel selector valves were in the 'ON' position, which was the pilot\u2019s normal operating procedure. The airplane does not use an interconnected fuel vent system, but instead uses individual vents in the caps of each tank. With both fuel tank selector valves in the 'ON' position, if one vent is plugged, or partially misaligned, the vent pressure difference will result in unequal fuel flow to the engine and will move fuel from the higher pressure vent/tank to the lower pressure vent/tank. Also, if both fuel tank selector valves are in the 'ON' position, prolonged uncoordinated flight with one wing lower than the other will result in unequal fuel flow to the engine and in fuel flowing from the high to the low wing tank.

The commercial pilot reported that, about 10 minutes from their destination, the fuel gauge was reading \u201cclose to empty.\u201d About 5 minutes later, the engine lost power, at which time, the ATP took control of the airplane. The pilots attempted to deploy the ballistic parachute just before the forced landing; however, due to the low altitude, it did not fully deploy. The airplane impacted the ground hard, and the high surface winds dragged the airplane across rough and uneven terrain before it became entangled in a barbed wire fence. No fuel was found in the fuel pump or tank. An examination of the engine and fuel system revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have prevented the engine from producing power if fuel had been available. The fuel capacity information in the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook (POH) provided to the pilots and on the placard created by the ATP (based on the POH) was inaccurate. Although the manufacturer reported that it provided the correct POH to the owner when the airplane was delivered, the owner had the incorrect POH, and the investigation determined that several other owners of this airplane model had received the wrong POH upon delivery of their aircraft. The POH indicated that the airplane had 15 gallons total fuel capacity and 14.5 gallons usable fuel capacity. However, the airplane\u2019s actual total fuel capacity was 13.2 gallons and the usable fuel capacity was 12.7 gallons. The calculated fuel requirement for the accident leg of the flight would have been at least 13.2 gallons of fuel; thus, the engine stopped producing power due to fuel exhaustion. Even if the fuel capacity information had been accurate, visual flight rules night flights require a 45-minute fuel reserve, and that would not have been met on the accident leg. Thus, the ATP did not properly calculate the flight\u2019s fuel requirements. Further, he failed to adequately monitor the airplane\u2019s in-flight fuel consumption and recognize that the airplane was low on fuel. In addition, the airplane was not equipped to fly at night nor was it approved for night flight, yet the pilot planned the flight legs such that the airplane would be flying at night.\u000b\u000bThe ATP\u2019s most recent application for a Federal Aviation Administration airman medical certificate had been denied; the commercial pilot did not know this before the accident. Although the ATP was acting in the capacity of the pilot-in-command , because his medical certificate had been denied, he was not qualified to serve in this role. The ATP had severe heart disease, hypertension, and a history of stroke, which increased his risk for a cardiac arrhythmia; however, the autopsy found no evidence of a recent heart attack. The ATP also had a history of depression, and toxicological tests were positive for therapeutic levels of the antidepressant medication citalopram, which has an acceptable side effect profile. It could not be determined if the pilot was impaired by cardiac symptoms or depression around the time of the accident; however, the circumstances of the accident make it unlikely. \u000b\u000bThe manufacturer's instruction manual for the parachute stated that the minimum height for deploying the parachute ranged between 100 and 250 feet. However, the POH does not provide any information or guidance regarding the recommended altitude for deployment. \u000b",
            "probable_cause": "The loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion as a result of the manufacturer providing the incorrect Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook to the owner, which prevented the pilot from accurately calculating the fuel requirements before the flight. Contributing to the accident were the pilot\u2019s inadequate preflight planning and poor decision-making. "

During the landing flare over a baseball field, the airplane collided with poles and came to rest partially inverted.  The airplane had been operated about 188 hours since last receiving an annual inspection on April 5, 2001, approximately 1 calendar year prior to the accident.  Upon completion of the 2001 inspection, repair station personnel, who maintained the airplane for the pilot-owner, reported in the airplane's maintenance logbook that (emergency) airworthiness directive (AD) number 2000-18-53 was not applicable.  This was an error.  The repair station failed to note that the AD was pertinent to the oil filter converter plate gasket it had installed in the airplane's engine, and it should have so indicated by making an appropriate maintenance logbook entry.  Compliance with the AD required, in part, that the gasket be replaced on a recurring 50-hour basis.  The FAA indicated that gasket replacement was warranted because \"...protruding or swelling of the gasket allows oil to leak from between the plate and the accessory housing.  This condition, if not corrected, could result in complete loss of engine oil and subsequent seizing of the engine....\"  During the Safety Board investigator's examination of the airplane, only 8 ounces of oil were found in the 8-quart capacity oil sump, and the bottom of the airplane was oil soaked.  The oil leak originated from a breach in the oil converter plate gasket.  A 3/4-inch-long section of the gasket material was observed protruding from between the plate and the accessory housing.  The engine's seizure was attributed to the loss of engine oil emanating from the extruded converter plate gasket, resulting in lubricating deprivation to the internal reciprocating components.",

During the climb out, the controller inquired several times as to the flights altitude.  The pilot's response to the controllers queries were exactly 10,000 feet lower than what the controller was indicating on radar.  Eventually the controller instructed the pilot to stop altitude squawk, which he did.  During the last communication with the pilot, he reported that he was level at 14,000 feet.  During the next approximately 45 minutes, the aircraft was observed proceeding generally in the direction of its destination.  When the controller observed the flight track turn approximately 45 degrees to the right and headed generally northwest, he attempted to contact the pilot without a response.  The tracking then turned about 90 degrees to the left for a few minutes, then turned 180 degrees to the right.  The aircraft dropped from radar coverage shortly thereafter.   On site investigation revealed that the aircraft broke-up in flight as the wreckage was scattered generally east-to-west over the mountainous terrain for approximately .3 nautical miles.  Further investigation revealed that the right wing separated at the wing root in an upward direction.  Separation points indicated features typical of overload.  The right side horizontal stabilizer separated upward and aft.  The left side horizontal stabilizer remained attached however, it was twisted down and aft.  The aft fuselage was twisted to the left.  Both engines separated in flight from the wings.  Post-crash examinations of the airframe and engines did not reveal evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction.  Both altimeters were too badly damaged to test.  Autopsy and toxicology results indicated that the pilot had severe coronary artery disease with greater than 95% narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery by atherosclerotic plaque.

This resulted in distortion of the left engine nacelle, excessive drag, loss of wing lift, & reduced directional control. The degraded performance resulted in a forced landing. While landing, the airplane passed through trees, impacted the ground, & was further damaged by postimpact fire. An exam of the left propeller revealed the blade had failed due to a fatigue crack that originated from multiple corrosion pits in the taper bore surface of the blade spar. The crack had propagated toward the outside of the blade & around both sides of the taper bore. Due to 2 previous blade failures (separations), a borescope inspection procedure had been developed by Hamilton Standard to inspect returned blades (that had rejectable ultrasonic indications) for evidence of cracks, pits & corrosion. The accident blade was one of 490 rejected blades that had been sent to Hamilton Standard for further evaluation & possible repair. Maintenance technicians, who inspected the blade, lacked proper NDI familiarization training & specific equipment to identify the corrosion that resulted in fatigue. (See: NTSB/AAR-96/06 for additional information.) ",
            "probable_cause": "the in-flight fatigue fracture and separation of a propeller blade resulting in distortion of the left engine nacelle, causing excessive drag, loss of wing lift, and reduced directional control of the airplane.  The fracture was caused by a fatigue crack from multiple corrosion pits that were not discovered by Hamilton Standard because of inadequate and ineffective corporate inspection and repair techniques, training, documentation, and communications.  Contributing to the accident was Hamilton Standard's and FAA's failure to require recurrent on-wing ultrasonic inspections of the affected propellers.  Contributing to the severity of the accident was the overcast cloud ceiling at the accident site. "

The mountain ridgeline rises between 8,000 and 12,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The glider\u2019s datalogger recorded the glider\u2019s position and altitude every 6 seconds as the pilot flew north along the ridgeline. The flight lasted 1 hour 12 minutes; during the last half of the flight, the glider was flying below the ridgeline and within one or two wingspans of the terrain slope. One minute before the final data point was recorded, the glider reversed course and proceeded south. The change in ground speed from 90 knots before the course reversal to 60 knots after the course reversal indicates that the glider turned into a strong southerly wind. The glider impacted the slope in a nose-low attitude and with wings parallel to the 65-degree terrain slope at 7,478-feet msl. The angle of impact is consistent with the glider being in a left turn (away from terrain) at the time of impact. No preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures were found that would have precluded normal operation of the glider. Weather observations between two locations, one at the south end of the valley and one at the north end of the valley, indicated clear skies and warming surface temperatures. Wind magnitudes increased dramatically at the surface the hour before the accident at the northern weather observation station due to the warming surface temperatures and the developing valley breeze circulation. Typical daily orographic turbulence was most likely present near the mountainous terrain. Toxicology test results from cavity blood samples taken from the pilot revealed positive results for temazepam (sedative). The identified level of temazepam is considered to be in the therapeutic range for this medication. While it is possible that the results are reflective of the true blood level and that the pilot could have experienced some level of impairment from this medication, the investigation was unable to conlude that the pilot was impaired because the possibility of post-mortem redistribution of drugs can make the assessment of cavity blood difficult when trying to determine true blood level and impairment.",
            "probable_cause": "The glider encountered a strong downward orographic wind flow and turbulence that forced it into terrain. Also causal was the pilot\u2019s decision to operate the glider very close to the terrain. "

Sixteen spins, with the aircraft in four different configurations, were planned. The aircraft successfully completed the first configuration with a set of four spins. The pilot then completed three of the four spins in the second set of spin testing. With the aircraft at 10,000 feet, the pilot initiated a spin to the left. Once the spin was established, the pilot made the planned control inputs. Despite several attempts by the test pilot to recover the aircraft from the maneuver, the aircraft continued to spin. At the planned altitude of 6,000 feet, the pilot elected to deploy the aircraft's recovery parachute and pulled the chute's activation handle. The parachute did not deploy, and the aircraft continued to spin. The pilot then elected to jettison the cabin door, exit the airplane, and deploy his parachute. The airplane descended into terrain and was substantially damaged. During a subsequent review of flight test data, the airplane manufacturer discovered that an unrecoverable spin could develop in the prototype airplane.  An examination of the aircraft's parachute system revealed that the rocket system used to deploy the chute had activated, however; the parachute failed to be pulled from its canister. The parachute's incremental cord was found, and inspected; the entire series of \"bar tabs\" were torn; an indication that the rocket motor pulled with its full force.

While a mechanic was performing the engine runups, a gust of wind kited the blimp and then forced it down, fully collapsing the wheel strut which was mounted to a truss assembly in the bottom of the control car in close proximity to the rudder control system's idler shaft assembly drive sprockets.  The pilot of the blimp who witnessed the incident, discussed the incident with a mechanic, then entered the control car and moved the rudder pedals and control wheel each way to insure that there were no flight control restrictions; however, prior to departure, the pilot did not perform a pre-unmasting flight control check with the aid of the crew chief, which was required by the aircraft flight manual.  After applying power and lifting off, the nose of the blimp began to move left.  The pilot could not arrest the turn with the application of right rudder.  There was no response or feedback from the rudder and the blimp began to drift to the east.  The pilot tried to steer using differential power but, when he added power on either engine, it only increased the rate of turn to the left.  As the blimp continued to drift eastward while simultaneously turning left, the blimp approached a metropolitan area and the Atlantic Ocean.  The pilot then descended so that if the blimp drifted towards an \"open\" area, a rapid descent could be initiated to the ground.  The descent was then continued by venting helium from the blimp's envelope.  As the blimp continued to descend the pilot realized that there were no open areas in which to land, and as the blimp was headed into the wind, he brought both engines to idle and held both helium valves full open until the blimp settled into trees.  Post incident examination of the blimps rudder control system revealed that the pedal cable/chain assembly had slipped off of the idler shaft assembly outboard drive sprocket.  Further examination revealed that the sprocket was partially surrounded by two metallic tabs, one located above the sprocket, and one located below the sprocket, which acted as a chain keeper guard; however, the front and left side of the sprocket was unguarded.",

The pilot reported that during his preflight inspection, the fuel gauges were reading a little over 30 gallons on the left and about 35 gallons on the right.  When the flight neared its destination, the pilot started a descent for landing.  As he 'pitched' the nose down, the left gauge went to zero.  A few minutes later, the right gauge went from about 20 gallons to zero, and a few seconds later, the right engine lost power, followed by the left engine.  A forced landing was initiated to a nearby road; however, after observing traffic on the road, the pilot elected to land in the grass area next to the road.  After touchdown, the right wing impacted a metal fence post, and the aircraft came to rest nose down in a ditch.  Examination of the fuel system by an FAA inspector revealed no usable fuel in the left fuel tank, and the right fuel tank was destroyed.  There was no evidence of fuel spillage at the accident site.  The pilot reported that he could have prevented this accident by adding an 'extra 10 gallons' of fuel. ",

The commercial pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the flight that originated at the Boonville Airport, Boonville, New York. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to records obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the airplane was purchased by the pilot through a corporation on March 3, 2014. The airplane was equipped with a Rotax 912 ULS, 100-horsepower engine and originally issued an airworthiness certificate on July 1, 1997.According to initial information obtained from an FAA inspector, the pilot was practicing touch-and-go takeoffs and landings on the reservoir. A witness observed the airplane departing from the water and flying overhead before losing sight of it behind trees. The witness stated that the airplane sounded as if it was approaching for another landing and she heard a series of engine \"sputters and roars\" followed by silence; however, she did not associate the sounds with an airplane accident. The airplane was subsequently located submerged in the water. The canopy was completely fractured and the airframe around the forward portion of the canopy was substantially damaged.Initial examination of the airframe and engine by an FAA inspector did not reveal evidence of any obvious catastrophic failures. The wreckage was retained for further examination to be performed at a later date.

The pilot notified the Carson City Sheriff's Office, and a ground team accessed the wreckage about 1600 that same day. They determined the identity of the airplane, and that the sole person on board had received fatal injuries. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and no FAA flight plan was filed for the flight.According to the girlfriend of the pilot, the airplane was based at Farias Wheel airport (NV33) Smith Valley, Nevada, and the pilot had flown to CXP on March 8 for some shopping errands. The girlfriend's last communication with the pilot was a text message from him at 1538 on March 8, asking whether she was planning to be home for dinner. She therefore expected him to return either later that day, or possibly on the morning of the following day, since occasionally he did remain overnight at CXP. She did not become concerned until mid-day March 9, and reported the airplane missing about the same time that the overflying pilot had noticed it.Two different witnesses at CXP reported that they observed the airplane depart CXP on the afternoon of March 8. However, their two reported departure times differed by 3 hours, and that difference could not be readily reconciled. CXP was not equipped with an air traffic control tower, and preliminary searches of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radio communications and radar data did not reveal any evidence of the accident flight. An initial query of Fallon Naval Air Station (NFL) Fallon, Nevada, radar data did not yield any data that could be associated with the accident flight. The airplane impacted terrain in a nose-down attitude, at an elevation of about 6,200 feet above mean se level, near the eastern end of an approximately east-west valley which opened to the west. The wreckage was aligned on a magnetic heading of about 312 degrees. The engine data plate indicated that the airplane was equipped with an 85 hp Continental Aircraft Engines C-85 engine. The fixed-pitch all-metal propeller remained attached to the engine, and was nearly buried in the sandy soil. The propeller bore significant chordwise scouring on both blades. There was no fire. Initial examination of the wreckage did not detect any pre-impact mechanical deficiencies or failures. According to FAA information, the airplane was manufactured in 1946. The pilot held a flight instructor certificate for single and multi-engine instrument airplanes. He held a second-class FAA medical certificate, and reported that he had a total flight experience of approximately 4,900 hours.",

The captain estimated that when the airplane began to lean and veer it was positioned in the vicinity of taxiway T-2, and the airplane stopped in the vicinity of taxiway U. The flight crew then evacuated the airplane onto the taxiway via the L1 door slide. The digital flight data recorder (DFDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were examined by the NTSB. All pertinent parameters on the DFDR were noted to be consistent with those of a normal landing having been performed. When the CVR was auditioned, all conversations were in Spanish and proved to be consistent with a normal landing having occurred. Disassembly of components of the right main landing gear torque tube showed that the outboard torque tube attach bolt had backed out from the piston prior to the incident.  The torque tube is attached to the piston by an attach bolt, which is threaded and has a hole drilled in the end.  The attach bolt is threaded into the piston and then torqued to 475 ft-lbs.  The next step is to install the lockbolt, which retains the attach bolt in place.  According to the operators Manager of Quality Assurance, the attach bolt was not properly torqued and the lockbolt was installed, but not through the hole in the end of the attach bolt.  As a result, after 11 cycles, the attach bolt backed out of the threaded area of the piston and the right main landing gear collapsed.  According to the QA Manager, during installation of the right main landing gear, a maintenance personnel shift change had occurred, and the new shift was not informed by the outgoing shift what work still needed to be accomplished, which resulted in the right main landing gear being reassembled incorrectly. Damaged landing gear parts were collected and sent to the NTSB's Metallurgical Laboratory, Washington DC, where they were examined optically.  The examination revealed that the damaged parts exhibited signatures consistent with that of overstress separations. No preexisting cracks or corrosion were noted.",

The PNF failed to recognize, address and correct the PF's inappropriate control inputs.  An inoperative stall warning system failed to reinforce to the flightcrew the indications that the airplane was in a full stall during the recovery attempt.  The flightcrew's exposure to a low fidelity reproduction of the DC-8's stall characteristics in the ABX DC-8 flight training simulator was a factor in the PF holding aft (stall-inducing) control column inputs when the airplane began to pitch down and roll.  The accident could have been prevented if ABX had institutionalized and the flightcrew had used the revised FEF flight stall recovery procedure agreed upon by ABX in 1991.

Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from the West Michigan Regional Airport (BIV), Holland, Michigan, about 0036. The intended destination was the Bluffton Airport (5G7), Bluffton, Ohio.Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control (ATC) was providing radar vectors for the Area Navigation (RNAV) GPS Runway 23 approach into 5G7. The controller cleared the pilot for the approach at 0109, and the pilot acknowledged. The flight was about 15 miles northeast of 5G7 at the time. No further communications were received from the pilot. There was no distress call or indication of any in-flight difficulties from the pilot. The final radar data point was recorded at 0110, with an associated mode-C altitude of 3,100 feet mean sea level.A witness located on Highway 18, south of the accident site, reported observing the airplane on an east-southeasterly course.

He estimated the airplane's altitude as about 600 feet above ground level. It appeared to be wings level and descending slightly when he initially saw it. There appeared to be a fire near the rear of the airplane. It subsequently descended behind a line of trees before the \"sky lit up.\"The airplane impacted a residential front yard about 35 feet southeast of County Road 18, between County Road 215 and 216.

The pilot elected to return to his home airport and while en route the engine experienced additional sudden and intermittent power reductions. The pilot was able to restore power either by applying full throttle or the application of carburetor heat. With the airplane approximately 2.5 miles from his home airport, the engine rpm decreased again and the pilot applied carburetor heat without any affect. The engine ceased producing power completely and the pilot elected to attempt to lose altitude and perform a forced landing to the runway. The pilot overshot the runway and the airplane touched down in the grass past the runway surface and nosed over.

A weather observation taken at the airport, about the time of the accident included, wind from 210 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 19 knots, a temperature 30 degrees Celsius (C), and a dew point of 20 degrees C.

As the airplane approached the foothills, it entered a series of turns. The radar data did not include altitude information, most likely because the altitude reporting mode of the airplane's transponder was inoperative. A witness, located in her residence near the accident site, observed the airplane flying unusually low along the ridgeline. The airplane then made an abrupt, swooping, and descending turn. As it began to roll out of the turn, the wings started to rock from side to side, and the airplane then immediately descended nose-down into the ground. The airplane did not appear to be trailing smoke or vapor, and the engine was producing a sound consistent with high power throughout the maneuver. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the airplane struck the ground in a near vertical nose-down attitude. The impact attitude and the witness\u2019s description of the rocking wings followed by an immediate nose-down descent both are consistent with an aerodynamic stall. Analysis of the radar data revealed that, in the final turn, the airplane was flying at a speed of about 77 knots with a turn radius of about 400 feet. To achieve the turn radius observed would have required a bank angle between 50 and 60 degrees with an associated increase in load factor that would have caused the airplane's stall speed to match or exceed its airspeed. The airplane's design was such that uncoordinated flight control input close to stall speed could result in an unrecoverable spin.Examination of the airplane's structure, the majority of which was consumed by postaccident fire, and the engine, which sustained heavy thermal damage, did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

The pilot elected to fly the helicopter for another 30 minutes to ensure normal operation. Shortly thereafter, about 200 feet above ground level and at 70 knots, the low rotor rpm audio warning sounded again. The pilot lowered the collective to restore rotor rpm, but engine and rotor speed accelerated through the upper limits. The pilot then reduced the throttle to idle and performed an autorotation. The helicopter landed hard into a salt marsh, buckling the tail boom. The pilot did not report any flight control anomalies with the helicopter.A postaccident examination of the governor drive housing and driveshaft assemblies revealed that the inner and outer raceways were \"frosted\" in the ball tracks. Additionally, the ball tracks were offset from the center of the raceway in a manner consistent with a thrust load towards the driveshaft nut, relative to the drive housing. The ball track offset was not circumferentially uniform, suggesting that the bearing inner races were misaligned relative to the outer bearing races. In general, such misalignment typically results in excessive forces and subsequent fatigue failure of the ball separator. The failure of the drive bearings caused the power turbine governor to provide the incorrect signal to the main fuel control. A review of the engine records indicated that the last overhaul of the power turbine governor was at 1,942.9 hours time since new.

The student pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the flight which departed from Finger Lakes Regional Airport (0G7), Seneca Falls, New York at about 1115. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.A pilot-rated witness observed the airplane in the traffic pattern for runway 19 (5499' x 100') prior to the accident. He stated that as the airplane turned left from onto the base leg of the traffic pattern, it was in a \"very aggressive slip\". About the same time, he observed the windsock and estimated the winds to be from about 320 degrees, and \"greater than 10 knots.\" He stated that while on final approach, the airplane appeared to be \"high and fast.\" He estimated its height to be about 100 to 150 feet above the ground as it crossed over the runway threshold, and it then appeared to \"float\" down the runway. He then lost sight of the airplane behind terrain and obstructions, and realized that the airplane had crashed when he several minutes later saw first responders arriving at the airport. He noted that during the landing approach, the flaps appeared to be fully extended, the propeller was rotating, and the engine sounded as if it were at idle speed.Another witness was located on a golf course adjacent to the airport, at near the mid-point of runway 19. When he first saw the airplane, it was almost abeam his position adjacent to the runway, and it looked like it was taking off. He elaborated that the engine sounded \"normal,\" and the climb appeared normal from the time the wheels left the ground, until a height of about 50 feet. At that point the airplane began climbing at a faster rate than it had been previously, and banked to the left. The airplane also appeared to be higher and climbing faster than other airplanes he had previously observed at about the same location. The airplane then descended, while continuing the left banking arc as if the left wing was \"tied to the ground with a string\".The pilot held a student pilot certificate and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) third-class medical certificate, which was issued on January 20, 2014. To date, his pilot logs had not been recovered. According to the pilot's flight instructor, the pilot had been endorsed for solo flight around October 2014, and had accumulated an estimated 40 total hours of flight experience.The 1135 weather observation at PEO included wind from 310 at 8 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear skies, temperature 73 F, dewpoint 37 F, altimeter setting 30.08 inches of mercury.The airplane came to rest upright with the right wing resting on the airport perimeter fence, about 300 feet to the left of the runway centerline, about 2,800 feet from the runway 19 approach threshold. All of the major components of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. Areas of disturbed soil and intermittent ground scars extended from the initial impact point oriented on a heading of 145 degrees magnetic. A piece of left wing navigation light was located in the wreckage path about 20 feet from the initial impact point. About 15 feet further down the path, a ground scar was found oriented 90 degrees to the path, about the length of the propeller diameter and the width of a propeller blade. About 2 feet further was an impact crater 3 feet wide and 8 feet in length containing paint chips and fragments of wind screen, followed by the main wreckage, which had come to rest oriented on a heading of about 340 magnetic.The propeller remained attached to the crankshaft flange, and both blades displayed s-bending, chordwise scratching, and leading edge gouging. The engine remained partially attached to the firewall by its mounts. The nose landing gear was fractured and separated from the airplane at the firewall attachment point, consistent with impact. The nose section from the firewall forward had separated from the fuselage on both sides, and the windscreen was fractured and separated from the fuselage. The outboard portion left wing was deformed upward, and displayed aft crush damage consistent with ground contact. The right wing displayed a concave depression and was deformed aft beginning outboard of the wing strut.First responders reported that upon their arrival they observed fuel leaking from the left wing in the area of the vent tube, and subsequently drained about 7 gallons from the left wing, and about 10 gallons from the right wing. Fuel samples from both tanks displayed a color and odor consistent with automotive gasoline, and a trace amount of water was detected in the sample from the left wing and in fuel recovered from the carburetor float bowl.Flight control continuity was established from each control surface to the cockpit area. The elevator trim tab actuator position was consistent with 5-10 degrees of tab deflection in the nose up direction. The flap actuator extension was measured, and found in a position consistent with a 40-degree flap extension. The front seat tracks and seat roller brackets for both seats were checked for wear, and found to be within prescribed limits. The left seat positioning rod was found bent forward about 1-inch from the engagement end.The engine crankshaft was rotated by hand at the propeller flange and continuity of the valve and powertrains was confirmed to the rear accessory gears. The oil screen and paper oil filter element were unobstructed and absent of metallic contamination. The spark plugs were removed and the #6 cylinder plugs displayed black-colored carbon-type fouling. Thumb compression was confirmed on all cylinders. The fuel strainer screen and carburetor inlet screen were absent of debris.
