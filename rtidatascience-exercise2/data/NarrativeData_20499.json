Although the touchdown was uneventful, during the landing roll the aircraft encountered some rough terrain, resulting in substantial damage. A post-accident engine teardown inspection found a large hole in the top of the crankcase, and numerous internal parts failures.

Witnesses further observed the airplane enter a spin, and descended rapidly and collided with the ground. Post accident examination of the accident site revealed that the engine, propellers, main fuselage, left wing assembly, vertical and horizontal stabilizers were located in a crater 10-feet in diameter and 6-feet in depth. The right wing assembly was located 0.13 nautical miles on a 354-degree heading from the main wreckage site. No radio transmissions were received from the pilot prior to the accident. Post examination of the right wing revealed it separated due to the fatigue failure of the forward lower attach flange at the inboard side of the right wing attach joint. The fatigue fracture had a primary origin area at the lower surface of the horizontal leg of the flange at the outboard edge of the spot face for the fastener in the outboard fastener row located closest to the forward end of the flange. The fatigue crack propagated relatively slowly upward until it extended nearly through the thickness of the flange and was 2.3 inches long at the lower surface. Additionally slow-growth fatigue cracks were present at the outboard edges of other spot faces aft of the primary origin area. Beyond the slow-growth regions, the crack propagated relatively rapidly to a length of at least 12 inches aft of the forward end. Features associated with the more rapidly propagating portion of the fatigue region included relatively rough fracture features, crack arrest marks at up to 9.3 inches aft of the forward end, and wear between the fastener heads and the flange at distances up to 12 inches aft of the forward end.

The radar data depicted a descent from 6,900 feet to 5,700 feet msl at the last recorded radar target. The last radar target was located about 0.32 miles southeast of the accident site, at 5,700 feet msl.

The airplane was equipped with satellite radar weather (NEXRAD Composite) and a stormscope/strikefinder. Using his equipment and talking with air traffic controllers, the pilot noted a break in the extreme precipitation, which still contained moderate to heavy precipitation, about 115 miles from the airplane's position. As the airplane approached that area, the pilot reported that a thunderstorm cell had filled it in; however, there was still a gap in the line of thunderstorms about 10 miles north. The pilot then attempted to fly to that gap and no further communications were received from the accident airplane. Review of the airplane's radar track was overlaid on a weather radar plot and revealed that the pilot attempted to fly though a Level 5, or heavy, thunderstorm cell. The turbulence from that cell resulted in an in-flight breakup of the airplane due to overstress, and the wreckage was scattered over a mile on the ground.The satellite radar weather information, most likely displayed in the airplane cockpit when the pilot was attempting to fly to a gap in thunderstorm cells, was about 6 to 7 minutes old at the time of the accident and depicted the airplane in an area clear of precipitation. The airplane's stormscope/strikefinder would have provided real-time lightning information; however, it would have had significantly less detail than composite weather radar depictions and thus be less suitable for use in attempting to navigate through a line of thunderstorms and in between thunderstorm cells. Both sources of weather information used were less suitable than onboard weather radar, which would have provided real-time weather radar images in the cockpit. The pilot had obtained his instrument rating less than 2 years before the accident and had accrued about 32 total hours of actual instrument experience. The NTSB recently issued a related Safety Alert, In-Cockpit NEXRAD Mosaic Imagery, viewable at www.ntsb.gov, describing how the actual age of NEXRAD data can differ significantly from the age displayed.",

During landing he lightly applied brakes and observed that the airplane was accelerating.  The pilot initiated a go-around.  The engines were at maximum power and the crew alerting system illuminated left and right engine control failure messages.  The automatic power reserve armed light was also illuminated.  The crew maneuvered the airplane and troubleshot the engine control fail indication using the quick reference handbook while on downwind.  The right engine was shutdown and the left engine would not respond to throttle movements during the remainder of the incident flight.  The crew subsequently completed the emergency landing.  On scene and subsequent throttle quadrant assembly examinations showed the assembly could produce an out of specified range signal when the throttles had forward force applied to them.  Diagnostic storage unit data showed both engines' full authority digital engine control (FADEC)s encountered a fault signal from the engine controls about the time of the pilot's reported application of the throttles in response to the windshear during the incident approach.  The airplane's FADEC fault logic was designed to \"latch\" or hold the last good value when the upper specified parameter limit was exceeded.  The data showed the left engine went to flight idle when the right engine was shut down in accordance with the fault logic.  The airplane's design was Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified with that fault logic.  As a result of the investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board issued two urgent recommendations to the FAA.  A-08-46 recommended an immediate inspection of all throttle quadrants to ensure that pushing the throttle levers against the maximum power stops will not result in an engine control failure, and further require that any units that fail the inspection be replaced and that the replacement parts be similarly inspected. A-08-47 recommended an immediate emergency procedure for a dual engine control failure on the incident airplane model and incorporate the procedure into the airplane flight manual and quick reference handbook via an airworthiness directive.",

The pilot was unable to maintain altitude and continued on a straight-in approach for the airport.  During the landing flare, the pilot could not pull the control yoke \"far enough to roundout,\" and the airplane landed hard on the nosewheel, and came to rest off the side of the runway.  A flight control check after the accident revealed that the flight controls could only be deflected aft to the \"level flight\" position.  The horizontal situational indicator (HSI) was then removed from the instrument panel, and the flight controls could be deflected to their full aft position.  Examination of the control stop on the control column tube, revealed significant chaffing marks and black paint transfer on its upper surface.  Examination of the rear casing of the HSI revealed similar chaffing marks and an indentation consistent with the shape of the control column stop, on the lower edge of the instrument.  Additionally, five shock mounts were installed on the instrument panel, of which the lower right and lower center shock mounts were broken, and the upper left shock mount was not attached.  Examination of the shock mounts revealed they were fractured through their elastomeric center sections on one end of the mount, and large gaping cracks were noted on the opposite end of the mounts.  A large number of smaller circumferential cracks were also observed through the center section of the mounts.  The maintenance logbooks revealed that the HSI was installed in the airplane on August 17,1994, by an avionics facility, to replace the original directional gyro (DG) instrument.  According to the Cessna 210 Service Manual, \"The service life of shock-mounted instruments is directly related to adequate shock-mounting of the panel.

The fourth-stage turbine wheel outer ring was missing material along an approximately 30-degree arc and could not be rotated by hand. The engine had been overhauled at a facility in Canada and installed on the incident helicopter by the operator approximately 6 flight hours prior to the event. Several parts of the engine were removed and sent to the Safety Board's Material Laboratory for examination. Examination of the second-stage turbine wheel revealed a fatigue fracture through a blade. The fatigue progressed through approximately half of the airfoil, and the origin was located in the transition radius between the wheel rim outer diameter and the blade near the junction of a fore-to-aft mold line that was created during original manufacture. The blade failed due to fatigue, and the oxidation of the blade fracture surface suggested that the fatigue was due to thermal loads. No metallurgical or mechanical discontinuities were noted at the surface. Examination of the other 23 blades on the same wheel revealed small cracks in the same general location as the fatigue origin on the fracture blade.

The air traffic controller did not provide approach clearance to the accident airplane until it was inside the final approach fix (FAF) and 1,000 feet above the FAF crossing altitude. The controller also issued a late turn to intercept the approach course, and he did not issue a descent clearance because his attention was directed to resolving a separation conflict involving two other aircraft. According to data recorded by the airplane's primary flight display, the pilot disconnected the autopilot after receiving the approach clearance, and the airplane then began a rapid descent. About 40 seconds later, the airplane rolled left and tracked left of the approach course. The airplane's ground proximity warning alert activated, and the airplane subsequently rapidly reversed roll and pitch directions consistent with an attempt by the pilot to correct the airplane's hazardous flight path. The airplane continued to roll right and pitch to a nose-high attitude before rapidly transitioning to a nose-down attitude of more than 85 degrees. As the airplane descended below a 900-foot cloud layer, the pilot rolled the airplane to wings level and made a high g-force pullup until ground impact. Given the pilot's high workload due to deficient approach control services and possible distraction while operating in instrument meteorological conditions and the subsequent loss of airplane control, it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation.Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Toxicology testing indicated the pilot used cocaine, hydrocodone, and marijuana at some point in the recent past. However, the use of the cocaine and hydrocodone likely did not affect the pilot's performance at the time of the accident, and the effect of the marijuana use could not be determined from the available evidence.",

The controller advised the pilot of available airports for landing if necessary and asked the pilot's intentions. The pilot chose to continue the flight. GPS data recorded by an onboard avionics system indicated that the engine had momentarily lost total power about 20 seconds before the pilot reported a problem to the controller. About 7 minutes later, when the airplane was about 7,000 feet above ground level, the engine lost total power again, and power was not restored for the remainder of the flight. The pilot attempted to glide to an airport about 10 miles away, but the airplane crashed in a field about 3 miles from the airport. GPS data showed a loss of fuel pressure before each of the engine power losses and prolonged lateral g-forces consistent with a side-slip flight condition. The rudder trim tab was found displaced to the left about 3/8 inch. Flight testing and recorded flight data revealed that the rudder trim tab displacement was consistent with that required to achieve no side slip during a typical climb segment. The GPS and flight data indicated that the lateral g-forces increased as the airplane leveled off and accelerated, indicating that the automatic rudder trim feature of the yaw damper system was either not engaged or not operating. The recorded data indicated autopilot system engagement, which should have automatically engaged the yaw damper system. However, the data indicated the yaw damper was not engaged; the yaw damper could have subsequently been turned off by several means not recorded by the avionics system. Testing of the manual electric rudder (yaw) trim system revealed no anomalies, indicating that the pilot would have still been able to trim the airplane using the manual system. It is likely that the pilot\u2019s failure to properly trim the airplane\u2019s rudder led to a prolonged uncoordinated flight condition. Although the fuel tank system is designed to prevent unporting of the fuel lines during momentary periods of uncoordinated flight, it is not intended to do so for extended periods of uncoordinated flight. Therefore, the fuel tank feed line likely unported during the prolonged uncoordinated flight, which resulted in the subsequent loss of fuel pressure and engine power.  The propeller and propeller controls were not in the feathered position, thus the windmilling propeller would have increased the airplane\u2019s descent rate during the glide portion of the flight. The glide airspeed used by the pilot was 20 knots below the airspeed recommended by the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), and the reduced airspeed also would have increased the airplane\u2019s descent rate during the glide. The flight and GPS data indicated that the airplane had a gliding range of about 16 nautical miles from the altitude where the final loss of engine power occurred; however, the glide performance was dependent on several factors, including feathering the propeller and maintaining the proper airspeed, neither of which the pilot did. Although the POH did not contain maximum range glide performance data with a windmilling propeller, based on the available information, it is likely that the airplane could have glided to the alternate airport about 10 miles away if the pilot had followed the proper procedures.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to properly trim the airplane\u2019s rudder during cruise flight, which resulted in a prolonged uncoordinated flight condition, unporting of the fuel tank feed line, and subsequent fuel starvation and engine power loss.

During the climb-to-cruise phase of the flight, as the airplane was ascending through 16,000 feet mean sea level (msl), the pilot noticed a reduction in manifold pressure. He advanced the throttle and observed an increase of one or two inches of manifold pressure. Shortly thereafter, the pilot heard a loud bang originate from the engine followed by an immediate loss of engine power. The pilot and CFI attempted to troubleshoot the engine anomalies and noted that it seemed to respond with the low boost \"on\", however it began to run rough whenever the throttle was advanced more than half way. They diverted to a nearby airport and conducted an emergency descent. As the airplane approached the airport, the pilot descended through an overcast cloud layer and attempted to enter the airport traffic pattern. While on final approach to the airport, the pilot thought the airplane was high and extended the landing gear and applied flaps. Shortly thereafter, the airspeed and altitude decreased drastically and the pilot realized he was too low. The pilot applied throttle and noticed no change in engine performance. The airplane subsequently struck a fence and landed hard in an open field just short of the airport, which resulted in structural damage to the fuselage and wings. A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the induction elbow for cylinders 1-3-5 (right side) was displaced from the throttle and metering assembly where the elbow couples with the throttle and metering assembly by an induction hose and clamp. The clamp was secure to the induction hose, however, the portion of the clamp that should have been installed beyond the retention bead on the throttle and control assembly was observed on the inboard side of the bead on the induction elbow. Review of the aircraft maintenance logbooks revealed that cylinders 4 and 5 were recently replaced prior to the accident flight due to low compression. The replacement of these cylinders required removal of the induction system to allow for cylinder removal and installation. In addition, a manufacturer service bulletin stated that during the reinstallation of the induction system, one must slide the induction hose and clamp(s) onto one of the tubes to be joined and that the connection joint and both tube beads are to be positioned in the center of the induction hose.

The owner/builder observed the first part of the takeoff roll to be \"completely normal, and there was no side-to-side motion of the aircraft and a rapid acceleration as he brought in full power.\"  However,  as soon as the airplane lifted off the runway, it climbed to approximately 40-50 feet, while simultaneously veering to the left.  It appeared that the pilot was \"fighting for control\" as the airplane \"veered slightly back towards the runway.\"  The airplane then veered back towards the left, toward a tree line.  As it approached the tree line, the engine noise grew \"noticeably louder,\" and the airplane went into a \"very nose-high attitude.\"  The airplane \"appeared to hang on the prop as it was pulled up and over [the] trees;\" however, no stall occurred, and the engine \"appeared to be working without any issue.\"  A certificated flight instructor saw the accident airplane 20-50 feet above the runway, near runway centerline, \"but apparently experiencing what [he] believed was a stability or control problem.\"  He saw the airplane \"oscillating (porpoising?) in pitch, wings approximately level.\"  The pilot then appeared to gain pitch control, and the airplane began a climbing left turn about 90 degrees from the runway heading, toward a tree line.  The airplane then descended below and beyond the tree line, but subsequently came back up above it, and made another left turn back toward the airport.  The airplane then \"banked steeply left, pitched down,...went into the trees in a steep nose-down and banked attitude (possibly stalled),\" and impacted a machine shop.  The owner/builder also noted that the altitude of the airplane was so low during the flight that the BRS could not have been effectively deployed.  In addition, the pilot appeared to have a \"control issue from the moment the aircraft left the ground.\"  Because the airplane was consumed in an intense post-impact fire, a detailed examination of the wreckage could not be made.  The certificated airline transport pilot had accrued over 5,250 hours of flight time.",

However, on the day of the accident, maintenance was performed on the airplane, and three engine run-ups were performed using the left main fuel tank. The pilot ferried the airplane back to its home base uneventfully with the left main fuel tank selected. Before the accident flight, the pilot verified that there was adequate fuel in the right main fuel tank; however, he did not reposition the fuel selector to the right main fuel tank. During climb, about 800 feet above ground level, the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot was unable to restart the engine and performed a forced landing. Subsequent examination revealed that the airplane\u2019s right main fuel tank had been compromised and was leaking fuel, whereas the left main fuel tank was intact and devoid of fuel.  Additionally, data downloaded from the airplane's engine monitor revealed that the engine power loss was preceded by a loss of fuel flow.

Impact signatures were consistent with a nose-down attitude with a near-vertical descent angle. Distribution of the airplane wreckage supported the observation by eyewitnesses of an in-flight breakup. An examination found that both wings failed in overload with positive wing loading.

Following numerous failed attempts to restart the engine, it eventually started and began to emit flames from the inlet port and a fire extinguisher was used to suppress the fire. The day of the accident, and after cleaning the residue left from the extinguishing agent, the pilot started the engine, performed a runup and then departed to fly the airplane back to his home airport. A short time after takeoff, the airplane was observed by witnesses to be maneuvering at a low altitude adjacent to a highway as if attempting to land on the road. The engine experienced a loss of engine power and the airplane collided with trees and powerlines during a forced landing; the airplane came to rest inverted and was partially consumed by a post crash fire. A postaccident inspection revealed that the extensive fire damage precluded testing the integrity of the fuel system. Numerous fittings and controls on the engine were loose or very low torque, most likely due to thermal damage from the post crash fire.

After starting the engine the pilot repositioned the trim wheel inside the cockpit to the takeoff position.  During takeoff rotation the pilot eased back on the yoke and reported that the aircraft felt heavier than usual.  As the aircraft came off the ground, the pilot released some of the back pressure and the aircraft struck the runway.  The pilot pulled the yoke back and the aircraft bounced higher and harder.  After the second bounce the pilot reduced the power, the nose wheel struck the runway and collapsed the nose landing gear.  Approximately 1 month before the accident a discrepancy was reported indicating that the pitch trim wire had jumped its groove.  The same facility that had worked on the aircraft the day of the accident had repaired the pitch trim wire by repositioning the pitch trim indicator to center travel in the window.  The aircraft's type certificate data sheet notes that the total trim tab travel should be 43 degrees including the plus/minus tolerances.  An FAA inspector examined the aircraft and found that the total trim travel available was 35 degrees.

The captain cycled the reverser, and had decided to return to the gate when the messages cleared.  With the issue apparently resolved, he elected to takeoff.  The captain reported experiencing a small vibration on climb out and, a short time later, he heard a \"loud bang\" and the \"aircraft pitched and yawed/rolled to [the] left.\"   The autopilot disengaged and the left thrust lever moved to idle during the event.  The first officer ran the checklist to stow the reverser.  The captain decided to continue to the intended destination because the thrust reverser messages had cleared and the vibrations had stopped.  The flight subsequently landed uneventfully.  The flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the left engine vibration levels were elevated during the accident flight.  Approximately 3 minutes into the flight, the left engine thrust reverser unlocked parameter changed to \"On\" for about 1 second.  About 11:20 (MM:SS) after takeoff, the left engine vibration level increased momentarily, and both the left and right engine speeds and fuel flows began to decrease.  As the decrease in fuel flows was occurring, the airplane rolled right, left, and right again over about a 4-second period.  The decrease in engine parameters lasted over 3 minutes before returning to normal.  The left engine thrust reverser unlock parameter indicated \"On\" for about 4 seconds during that time.  The left engine vibration levels decreased after the event, below the levels previously recorded during the flight, and approximately to the level of the right engine vibration.  The vibration and engine speed variations suggested separation of the left engine translating cowling at that point.  The left engine thrust reverser deploy parameter remained in the \"Off\" state for the entire flight.  Additionally, the FDR data revealed that the left engine vibration levels were elevated and left engine thrust reverser did not deploy on the two previous flights.  The post accident inspection revealed that the left engine translating cowl had separated from the engine assembly and damaged the empennage.  Damage to the thrust reverser components was consistent with prior operation with the reverser out of alignment and jamming of the translating structure.  Review of the aircraft's maintenance records revealed a history of anomalies related to the left engine thrust reverser.  About one month prior to the accident, the aircraft maintenance log contained the discrepancy, \"L Rev Unlock Caution.\"  The entry was deferred in accordance with the minimum equipment list (MEL).  The left pneumatic drive unit and the left thrust reverser flex shafts were subsequently replaced; however the discrepancy was not resolved.  Eleven days after the initial write-up, a ballscrew actuator and a cascade assembly were replaced.  The maintenance record indicated that rigging and operational checks were satisfactory, and the MEL item was closed.  There were no further entries related to the left thrust reverser in the aircraft maintenance log.  The MEL allowed the airplane to be dispatched with one of the engine thrust reversers inoperative.  It required that the inoperative reverser be inspected for structural damage, deactivated, and stowed and locked in the forward thrust position.  In the event of an in-flight unlock or deploy indication, the flight manual instructed the crew to manually stow the reverser.  There was no guidance in the event of an indication on the ground.  Bombardier has initiated a revision to the flight manual to include instructions in the event of a thrust reverser unlock message received during ground operations.",
            "probable_cause": "In-flight separation of the left engine thrust reverser translating cowling due to intermittent binding and jamming of the reverser on the accident flight and on previous flights.  Contributing factors were the inadequate maintenance action by the operator due to their failure to properly resolve the prior reverser malfunctions, the failure of the pilots of previous flights in not referring earlier reverser deployment failures for maintenance action, and incomplete company/manufacturer's procedures because they did not address anomalous reverser indications during ground operations."

Cyclic loading from the bearing balls passing over the growing raceway spall resulted in extensive fretting of the outer diameter surface of the outer ring, from which a fatigue crack was initiated.  High-cycle fatigue progression radially through the outer ring was followed by rapid fracture and subsequent liberation of the outer ring fragments.  The debris contamination more than likely came from the high-pressure compressor (HPC) stubshaft coating, which was liberated and entered the #3 bearing area causing it to fracture, and the engine to lose power.

The helicopter stopped climbing and began to settle, and the pilot said he lowered the collective, and navigated between the building and the parking garage, to the street below, applying full collective pitch to cushion the landing on the street. He then performed the emergency shutdown procedures, and he and his crew egressed from the helicopter. The helicopter incurred damage to the main rotors and fuselage. The copilot stated that he was seated on the left side clearing for obstructions and heard a bump on the right side, followed by repetitive bumps, and saw chunks of helicopter pieces fly by, as the helicopter started to settle. The copilot said that the helistop is largely surrounded by buildings and every takeoff using the accident helicopter from the Miami Children's hospital was a maximum performance takeoff, with very little margin for error. He stated that the departure required the helicopter to be flown from the helipad over an awning covering a walkway and in between buildings on both sides down a street with very little clearance from the buildings, while executing a maximum performance takeoff to climb to gain altitude as quickly as possible. He stated that the operation at the Miami Children's Hospital had been a new contract, and that his management had told the flight crews that they knew it was \"tight in there, but to deal with it since they needed the work.\" The copilot stated that he had not received any site specific training to operate at the Miami Children's hospital helipad since his employment by the operator through the date of the accident. He said that flight related training was not conducted at the Miami Children's helistop due to the hospital's desire to reduce the noise in the residential neighborhood. On September 5, 2002, a Florida Department of Transportation (FL DOT) official and a FAA inspector examined the Miami Children's Hospital helistop, and noted that a significant amount of construction related changes had taken place since the last helistop inspection. FL DOT official stated that the construction included an elevated helipad, and that based on the new construction she requested that  Miami Children's Hospital conduct a survey to determine whether the required clearance requirements to retain the helistop license had changed since issuance of the license.  The Vice President/Chief Nursing Officer of the Miami Children's Hospital stated  that at FL DOT's request, a survey of the helistop was performed, and upon review of the survey by the management of the Miami Children's Hospital, management's impression was that the clearance requirements for the helistop had not been met due to the new construction/expansion, and helicopter operations at the hospital was suspended until the elevated helipad was completed.  A review of FAA records showed that prior to the accident, no reviews/oversight of flight operations at the Miami Children's Hospital's helistop had been conducted by the FAA. An FAA inspector stated that the operator had recently obtained the contract to operate the accident helicopter at the Miami Children's Hospital, and that prior to the accident no evaluation/oversight of the Title 14 CFR part 135 operation had not yet been performed due to it having been a new operation.",

Contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to require a recurrent detailed examination and or require those hoses be life limited to prevent failure.  Also, unsuitable terrain encountered by the pilot during the emergency descent for a forced landing. "

The flight was at an altitude of 400 feet when the pilot reported that the airplane's engine lost complete power.  The pilot elected to make a forced landing in a rice field.  During the landing roll, the left main landing gear wheel got caught in mud, causing the airplane to pull left, the right wing to strike the ground, and the airplane to come to rest on it's nose. Examination of the engine revealed that most of the engine oil had been pumped overboard from the area of the blower impeller, due to a malfunction of the blower, and caused the engine to seize. ",

(After the accident, he noticed the publication was out-of-date and did not have the correct CTAF published.)  The pilot said he could find no means for determining the wind direction, and he elected to land on runway 18. During the landing roll, he was unable to stop the aircraft on the remaining runway, and it overran the departure end, encountered a rough surface, and nosed over. The pilot said that after the accident, he realized he had unknowingly landed downwind with a 15-knot tail wind. Ground witnesses reported that the aircraft was very fast and had touched down about 1,000 feet down the 2,160-foot-long runway. The witnesses also stated that the winds had been steady from the north at 10 to 15 knots all morning. ",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's inadequate preflight planning/preparation (failure to ensuring the flight information publication was current); his selection of the wrong runway for landing; his failure to achieve the proper touchdown point during the landing; and his failure to go around, while there was still sufficient airspeed and runway available. The tailwind was a related factor. "

The pilot stated that he pulled up out of the field, dumped the load, and chose to land straight ahead in an adjoining field. The pilot reported that after touching down and holding the stick back the tail started lifting. Before it stopped, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness aviation safety inspector conducted a post accident examination of the airplane. The airplane's most recent annual inspection had been completed the day prior to the accident. The FAA inspector found the engine's Py line had not been secured properly, which would have prevented proper fuel scheduling to the engine's fuel control unit. The inspector also reported that the outboard leading edge of the left wing tip had sustained substantial damage, which would have adversely affected the flight characteristics of the airplane.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of maintenance personnel to properly install the engine's Py line correctly, which resulted in the total loss of engine power and subsequent force landing. Contributing to the accident was the lack of suitable terrain."

The landing was being made on runway 27.  The pilot reported that during the landing roll, the airplane veered to the right of the runway due to too much right aileron input.  He reported he neutralized the aileron and steered with the rudder.  A gust of wind along with the crosswind then lifted the right wing and the airplane veered to the left where it contacted ice on the runway and slid into a snow bank.  Inspection revealed the center of the runway was clear, however, there were patches of ice along the left side of the runway.  The snow along the sides of the runway was high enough so that only the tops of the runway lights were visible.  The pilot reported winds from 330 at 12 knots, gusting to 17 knots.  A weather observation at the airport taken 6 minutes after the accident reported winds from 320 degrees at 9 knots.",
