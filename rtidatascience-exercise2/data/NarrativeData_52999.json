As the airplane began to climb, the pilot and passenger, who was a certificated multi-engine flight instructor, observed the stall warning light illuminate, and the pilot lowered the nose to attain Vyse.  The right engine then began to loose power.  The pilot applied full power to the left engine, along with left rudder and the passenger retracted the landing gear.  The airplane banked to the right and descended to the ground.  The pilot additionally stated, 'The airplane just did not get enough speed up,' and suspected that the engine failure was from water in the fuel system.  Prior to flight the pilot and passenger observed 'a little bit' of water on the asphalt, which came from the right side fuel drain when the airplane was pre-flight inspected.  After the accident, a FAA inspector examined the area where the airplane was pre-flight inspected and did not observe any fuel stains on the asphalt.  The airplane was last flown 30 days prior to the accident.  A FAA Airworthiness Directive stated that to eliminate water contamination of the aircraft fuel supply, an inspection was required at each 50 hours of operation.   Maintenance records dated after September 16, 1997 did not reveal any compliance of the AD, and the airplane had accumulated about 281 hours of operation.  The airplane owner's manual stated, 'Accelerate to single engine minimum control speed (Vmc) before applying stronger back pressure for rotation.' The owner's manual also stated that, 'On take-off the aircraft should be kept either on, or near the runway, until reaching Vmc.'  The FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (AFH), stated, 'If the airplane has just become airborne and the airspeed is at or below Vmc when the engine fails, the pilot could avoid a serious accident by retarding both throttles immediately.  If this action is not taken immediately, the pilot will be unable to control the airplane.'  It additionally stated, 'THE AIRPLANE SHOULD NEVER LEAVE THE GROUND BEFORE Vmc IS REACHED.  Preferably, Vmc + 5 knots should be attained.'  The AFH also stated, 'Sufficient fuel should be drained from the fuel strainer quick drain and from each fuel tank sump to check for fuel grade/color, water, dirt, and smell.  If water is found in the first fuel sample, further samples should be taken until no water appears.' ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to obtain proper takeoff airspeed and his failure to follow published emergency procedures. Factors related to the accident were the pilot's inadequate preflight and water contamination of the fuel system. "

The airplane was owned and operated by Bedecorp, LLC. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the local flight. The test flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 and originated from FPR, about 1055.According to the manufacturer, this was the pilot's first time operating the airplane. In addition, the pilot was to only perform high speed taxi tests in order to familiarize himself with the airplane.According to a witness, the airplane performed two high speed taxi tests. Then, the airplane departed runway 28L, appeared to have \"issues\" because it was flying \"unstable and \u2026fast.\" According to another witness, when the airplane turned on to the final leg of the traffic pattern, it \"violently pitch[ed] up and down\" and then began a nose down descent. Subsequently, the airplane impacted terrain approximately one mile from the approach end of runway 28L.According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the airplane was issued a special airworthiness certificate on February 11, 2015, and registered to Bedecorp, LLC. The special airworthiness certificate was issued for the purpose of research and development and market survey. The airplane was equipped with a Lycoming O-235-L2C engine. At the time of the accident the airplane had accumulated about one hour of total time.A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that it impacted terrain in a nose down position and came to rest inverted on a 092 degree heading. There was an impact crater approximately 18 inches deep and all major components of the airplane were located in the vicinity of the wreckage. The airplane, forward of the aft bulkhead to the nose section, was consumed by postimpact fire. The engine was located in the impact crater and remained attached to the fuselage through control cables. The top spark plugs were removed, each cylinder was boroscoped, and no anomalies were noted.A GoPro Video Camera was obtained from the accident site and shipped to the NTSB recorders laboratory for data download. A preliminary review of the camera revealed that the engine was operating during the accident sequence. The airframe was retained for further investigation.",

The main rotor driveshaft, main rotor blades, and the tail rotor blades exhibited signatures consistent with low rotor rpm at impact.  Engine examination revealed that the gas producer and power turbine assembly had failed as a result of the cumulative effects of thermal stress due to over-temperature operation.  Further examination revealed that the exhaust gas temperature harness on the engine had a low signal output resulting in a low EGT indication in the cockpit which caused the company pilots to unknowingly operate the engine in excess of maximum EGT.  According to other company pilots who flew this helicopter on typical external load operations, the engine would reach its EGT limit before the maximum torque was achieved.  The operator did not routinely perform health indicator tests (HIT checks) which were developed by the U.S. Army to detect changes in engine power output. Review of the helicopter's FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet (H15NM) revealed the requirement for HIT checks to be accomplished prior to each takeoff and recorded in a log record. ",

Without this input, the governor erroneously sensed a turbine underspeed, and therefore provided fuel in excess of that required to maintain the correct speed. The splines failed due to a significant reduction in the flow of lubricating oil resulting from the partial blockage of an oil filter outflow orifice. The outflow orifice became partially blocked because the oil filter screen was aligned in its housing in a manner that allowed some contaminants to bypass it. Although the Kaman K-1200 Flight Manual contains an emergency procedure that allows for the pilot to take manual (non-governed) control of the fuel input to the engine in the event of a governor failure, the pilot did not perform the procedure because he was not able to correctly identify the cause of the sequence of events.

The jacket of the harness was removed, which revealed \"moist deposits\" and corrosion on the metallic ground shield. Removal of the shield revealed more deposits and corrosion, as well as cracked and burned insulation on wire 3. The exposed wire on pin 3 allowed a short circuit to ground which resulted in the stepper motor fault.

During the collision, N751PR was proceeding westbound on taxilane \"C\" for its planned departure for Manila.  F-GTOM had landed from France and was standing short of its assigned gate 101.  F-GTOM was oriented in a northwesterly direction, and its left wing was extending onto taxilane \"C\".  Six ground service personnel were in proximity to F-GTOM, awaiting the connection of a tow tractor to pull it into the gate at the Tom Bradley International Terminal (TBIT).  During the collision sequence, N751PR impacted the aft portion of F-GTOM's left wing.  N751PR's right wing's winglet was severed off and F-GTOM's left wing was substantially damaged.ATC had cleared the departing N751PR to taxi past the standing F-GTOM and make a 90-degree turn onto a nearby taxiway.  The ground crew's wing walkers for the standing airplane were aware that its left wing was partially blocking taxilane \"C.\"  One of the wing walkers issued its company-authorized \"engine operating\" signal that was observed by N751PR's crew.  This nonstandard signal was interpreted by the departing airplane's crew as an \"all clear to taxi\" signal in accordance with the standard hand signals published in the FAA's Aeronautical Information Manual and by its airline.The collision occurred as the departing airplane commenced a sharp left turn, from the centerline of taxilane \"C\" toward a perpendicular taxiway.  During the turn the effective length of the airplane's wing increased.  The right wing tip was not visible to the captain, and he relied upon his first officer and crewmembers to monitor its proximity to the standing airplane.  However, after passing abeam the standing airplane's empennage and observing the wing walker's \"all clear signal,\" the first officer redirected his attention toward their new course and away from the standing airplane's left wing.  Due to a lack of available ground area, and to accommodate the airport's need for additional airplane movement areas, the FAA had approved a reduction in clearance between the terminal gates and the adjacent taxiway/taxilane.  Airport management was aware of the collision hazard related to the proximity between taxilane \"C\" and adjacent terminal gates.  During the previous 5-year-period, three other collisions had occurred between Boeing 747 airplanes on the taxilane.  TBIT airport management personnel were responsible for enforcing published airport rules that required the arriving Boeing 747 SP-44 (F-GTOM) to power into gate 101, which was equipped with an operative docking light guidance system.  However, this guidance system had not been used by the contract ground service company for several years.  The TBIT management personnel failed to enforce the policy and allowed the ground service personnel to stop the arriving F-GTOM short of gate 101 thus partially blocking taxilane \"C.\"  The ground personnel, using their outdated airport rules manual (that directed a tow-in procedure), planned to utilize a tow tractor to pull the airplane the remaining distance to the gate.  This was contrary to the revised manual, which required a power-in procedure.  Airport management had failed to ensure that all manual holders were using updated versions of the manual.  ",
            "probable_cause": "Airport management's failure to ensure that its current operating procedure, which required the arriving airplane to power into the terminal gate, was being used.   Also causal was (1) the ground service company's utilization of an outdated arrival procedure that directed the arriving airplane to stop short of the gate, thereby obstructing the taxilane; and (2) the ground service company's utilization of a nonstandard marshalling hand signal which was, accordingly, misinterpreted by the departing airplane's crew.  A contributing factor was the departing airplane's first officer's misjudged evaluation of wing tip clearance."

After landing, the airplane was topped off with 156 gallons of fuel for the return flight. During the preflight inspection, a line serviceman at the fixed based operator observed the right main fuel tank sump become stuck in the open position. He estimated 5 to 6 gallons of fuel were lost before the sump seal was regained, but the exact amount of fuel lost could not be determined. The lost fuel was not replaced before the airplane departed. Data from an onboard GPS unit indicate that the airplane flew the return leg at an altitude of about 4,500 feet mean sea level for about 4 hours. About 4 minutes after beginning the descent to the destination airport, the pilot requested to divert to a closer airport. The pilot was cleared for an approach to runway 18R at the new destination. While on approach to land, the pilot reported to the air traffic control tower controller, \u201cwe exhausted fuel.\u201d The airplane descended and crashed into a forested area about 1/2 mile from the airport. Postaccident examination of the right and left propellers noted no leading edge impact damage or signatures indicative of rotation at the time of impact. Examination of the airplane wreckage and engines found no malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.The pilot did not report any problems with the airplane or its fuel state before announcing the fuel was exhausted. His acceptance of the approach to runway 18R resulted in the airplane flying at least 1 mile further than if he had requested to land on runway 18L instead.  If the pilot had declared an emergency and made an immediate approach to the closest runway when he realized the exhausted fuel state, he likely would have reached the airport. Toxicological testing revealed cyclobenzaprine and diphenhydramine in the pilot\u2019s system at or above therapeutic levels. Both medications carry warnings that use may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for activities such as driving or operating heavy machinery.The airplane would have used about 186 gallons of fuel on the 4-hour return flight if the engines burned fuel at the same rate as the previous flight.  The fuel lost during the preflight inspection and the additional 30 minutes of flight time on the return leg reduced the airplane\u2019s usable fuel available to complete the planned flight, and the pilot likely did not recognize the low fuel state before the fuel was exhausted due to impairment by the medications he was taking.",

Airplanes were in left traffic for landing on runway 20, and military helicopters were in right traffic landing to a midfield helipad on the west (right) side of the runway. According to the flight instructor (CFI) in the accident airplane, the student pilot completed three touch-and-go landings and proceeded around the pattern for a fourth landing. During the landing the airplane approached the runway as a helicopter \"suddenly lifted to a hover.\" Several witness statements and security video revealed that the 2,150-pound airplane followed behind an airplane that landed on the runway, and passed abeam an 18,000-pound Army utility helicopter on final approach to the helipad, before it banked sharply to the right and impacted terrain. Post-accident examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed partial separation of the right wing and substantial damage to the fuselage. The CFI reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. According to the FAA's Aeronautical Information Manual, section 7-3-7:In a slow hover taxi or stationary hover near the surface, helicopter main rotor(s) generate down wash producing high velocity outwash vortices to a distance approximately three times the diameter of the rotor. When rotor downwash hits the surface, the resulting outwash vortices have behavioral characteristics similar to wing tip vortices produced by fixed wing aircraft. However, the vortex circulation is outward, upward, around, and away from the main rotor(s) in all directions. Pilots of small aircraft should avoid operating within three rotor diameters of any helicopter in a slow hover taxi or stationary hover. In forward flight, departing or landing helicopters produce a pair of strong, high-speed trailing vortices similar to wing tip vortices of larger fixed wing aircraft. Pilots of small aircraft should use caution when operating behind or crossing behind landing and departing helicopters.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor's decision to continue the landing in close proximity to a landing helicopter, resulting in an encounter with rotor vortices, loss of airplane control, and collision with terrain."

The pilot departed with full fuel in both tanks (30 gallons), which she thought would be equivalent to 5 hours 13 minutes of flight.  The purpose of the 340 nautical mile flight was for the pilot to fulfill the solo cross-country requirements for the commercial pilot certificate.  The flight instructor thought that in an effort to satisfy the requirements, the pilot would need to perform a nonstop cross-country leg that was a minimum of 250 nautical miles.  During the flight over the mountains terrain, the winds were strong and turbulent.  While en route she realized that she had been off course for about 10 minutes, and maneuvered to get the airplane back on course, which took about 20-25 minutes.  After getting back on course, about 4 hours en route, the fuel gauges inside the cockpit indicated about 3 gallons of fuel in each tank.  After the pilot obtained visual contact with the airport, about 8,500 feet above ground level (agl), the airplane's engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion in the right tank.  She configured the airplane for best glide and switched to the left tank in an effort to regain power.  The engine started and ran for about 30 seconds, before the power loss recurred again.  During the descent, she followed the emergency checklist and glided down for about 5 to 10 minutes.  About 1,000 feet agl, she realized that the airplane would not be able to make it to the runway, due to the dense trees in the glide path.  She opted to land in a field, and, about 30 feet agl, the engine started again.  The airplane climbed to about 40 to 50 feet agl and drifted to the right.

The pilot and his passenger/wife, also a pilot with over 300 flight hours, planned to fly northward from Lincoln, California, to Bend, Oregon.  Neither pilot was instrument rated.  FSS provided the pilot with a weather briefing indicating flight precautions for mountain obscurement and thunderstorms.  Weather conditions along the planned route included multiple cloud layers at 2,000 and 4,000 feet msl, and light rain showers.  The pilot informed the FSS briefer that he could fly in IMC.  After a 0740 takeoff the pilot requested and received VFR radar flight following service, encountered the clouds, and commenced flight in IMC while continuing toward his intended destination.  At 0759:28, the pilot advised the Oakland ARTCC controller that he was in the clouds and on autopilot.  The controller advised the pilot to 'use caution and maintain VFR.'  The pilot again informed the controller that he was in the clouds and VFR flight was not possible, to which the controller responded at 0800:51 by stating 'maintain VFR.'  Then, the controller provided the pilot with directions to an airport ahead with unknown weather conditions.  The controller observed the airplane's 2,400-foot altitude and was aware that the minimum instrument altitude for the area was at least 5,000 feet.  Contrary to requirements specified in the FAA's Air Traffic Control Order 7110.65, the controller failed to perform his first duty priority by not properly assisting the pilot in an emergency.  The controller provided the pilot with a bearing to an airport south of his position necessitating a course reversal turn while proceeding in IMC, and he neglected to issue a safety alert for terrain proximity or give climb instructions to an area where flight under VFR was likely possible.  Seconds after the pilot received the turn instructions he became disoriented, lost control of the airplane, and in an inverted attitude impacted the underlying hilly terrain.  About 8 months prior to the accident flight the 78-year-old pilot's high blood pressure (180/90) was reduced with prescription drug treatment.  Insufficient specimens remained for definitive autopsies or toxicological tests.  No mechanical malfunctions were found with the airplane. ",

Examination of the magneto and the installed clamping blocks revealed that the mounting flanges on both sides of the distributor housing exhibited fatigue beach marks. Examination of the mounting flanges also revealed that there were two sets of contact marks. The smaller more linear inboard set of marks matched the contour of the installed magneto clamping blocks when tilted slightly.  These marks only penetrated slightly into the surface of the flanges.  The installed clamping blocks appeared to meet the shape and dimensional requirements of older style clamping blocks issued by the engine manufacturer.  The other marks were wider with curved ends that did not match any feature of the older style installed clamping blocks. A small step was apparent at the edge of the larger contact area indicating removal or displacement of material from the surface. The marks did however appear to match the configuration and shape for newer style clamping blocks introduced by the engine manufacturer on engines produced after March 1985.   According to the engine manufacturer, the change was instituted as a production product improvement and the use of the newer clamping blocks was not a mandatory requirement on the engine installed in this airplane.

The witness saw the pilot working on the airplane, and then the pilot and passenger stated that they were going to fly to a nearby airport to complete repairs. According to the passenger, they examined the fuel valve and found that the set screw had fallen out. He thought that they set the fuel selector to the right fuel tank before attempting the flight for further repairs. However, about 10 seconds after takeoff the engine started to lose power again.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The instrument-rated private pilot obtained a weather briefing and filed an instrument flight plan for a personal flight that would occur the following morning to attend a stock car race.  On the morning of the accident, the pilot contacted air traffic control (ATC) to obtain an instrument clearance. The pilot was given a clearance and was told that it would be void in 10 minutes. Two minutes prior to the expiration of the ATC void time, the pilot departed. Recorded non-volatile memory (NVM) data from the electronic cockpit flight display system were downloaded and analyzed by investigators, and these data greatly aided in the investigation.  Analysis of the data indicated that, while climbing in instrument conditions, and most likely using the autopilot, the pilot attempted to increase the airplane\u2019s climb rate by using the vertical speed bug on the electronic (glass) Primary Flight Display (PFD) in the cockpit.  However, the NVM data revealed that the PFD had failed to \u201calign\u201d, and was not fully functional. As a result of the PFD not being aligned, the bug settings (altitude and vertical speed) were suppressed, and not transmitted to the autopilot computer.  Therefore, when the pilot attempted to increase the airplane\u2019s vertical speed using the PFDs vertical speed bug, the changes were not transmitted to the autopilot computer and the autopilot did not command an increase to the rate of climb. Subsequently, the rate of climb momentarily increased twice, most likely due to pilot control inputs via the control wheel. (A review of the PFD Pilot's Guide revealed that it does not provide information to the pilot regarding the suppression of the bug settings when the PFD is not aligned.).Soon after the last vertical speed bug change, the airplane\u2019s vertical speed began to fluctuate (and oscillate between climbing and descending) significantly. These fluctuations continued for the remainder of the flight (about 9 minutes). During this period, the airplane completed three left-hand orbits at varying altitudes. The pilot then reported an \u201cautopilot problem\u201d to ATC, and he requested a clearance to divert to a nearby airport. The airplane\u2019s course deviated again to the left, after which the pilot again reported a problem with the autopilot. The airplane continued to fly for another 4 minutes as the vertical speed continued to oscillate.  The airplane\u2019s ground track remained erratic and was not consistent with a course toward the diversion airport.  The airplane entered an uncontrolled descent, impacted terrain, and was destroyed.Examination of the wreckage revealed that the pitch trim jackscrew was in the full nose-down position.  No preimpact malfunctions of the autopilot or flight control systems were discovered. The nose-down trim condition likely resulted from the pilot pulling on the control wheel with the autopilot engaged which would have resulted in the trim running nose down. Exams of the airplane\u2019s other systems, structure and engine did not reveal any evidence of preimpact malfunctions or failures.Risk factors for spatial disorientation were present at the time of the accident, including IMC and maneuvering flight. Analysis of the airplane\u2019s flight path during the accident flight, and the pilot\u2019s communications with ATC, indicates that the pilot became spatially disoriented while attempting to maneuver with reference to a degraded PFD.  The pilot was instrument current and qualified and he had accumulated about 291 hours operating the electronic flight display system. He had received formal training in two models of airplanes equipped with the same flight display system, and also experienced a failure of the display system on a previous airplane. Thus, the pilot was likely familiarized with the functionality of the PFD.Analysis of the NVM data from the PFD revealed that the PFD had not aligned during its \u201cpower cycle\u201d of the accident flight, nor had it aligned on the previous power cycle that occurred on the day of the accident.  The recorded data do not explicitly indicate the reason for the failure to align on either cycle; however, the previous power cycle was 333 seconds in duration, and the data indicate that the airplane was moving (taxing) at that time. Movement during this initial, critical alignment phase hinders the system\u2019s ability to align as it attempts to calculate the steady state bias of its rate sensors, and the PFD screen will display a message that states: \u201cINITIAL AHRS ALIGNMENT / REMAIN STATIONARY / OK TO TAXI in xx SECONDS\u201d.    After the 333-second power cycle, the system was shut down and restarted for the accident flight. No movement was recorded during the critical alignment period of this power cycle, although the airplane did taxi during the \u201cOK TO TAXI\u201d period of the alignment sequence. The investigation could not conclusively determine why the PFD would not align; however, the airplane departed 375 seconds after the PFD power cycle start-up, which may not have been sufficient time for the system to align. Typical time to align while remaining stationary is 166 seconds. The time to align when taxiing during the \u201cOK TO TAXI\u201d period varies considerably, based on the taxi motion and duration.  During a previous taxi event that was similar to the one on the day of accident, the time to align was 416 seconds. According to the flight display manufacturer, the failed alignment in both power cycles would have resulted in red X\u2019s being displayed on the PFD.  Based on the information recovered from the accident unit, it is likely that red X\u2019s were displayed at the time of the takeoff. Regardless, the airplane was equipped with traditional standby flight instruments (specifically an attitude indicator, an altimeter, an airspeed indicator, a magnetic compass), and dual global positioning systems, which should have provided sufficient information for the pilot to have maintained situational awareness to allow for continued safe flight after failure of the PFD. The investigation revealed a history of numerous failures of multiple types that affect the flight display system\u2019s reliability. Additionally, examination of the accident airplane\u2019s magnetometer also revealed evidence of fretting corrosion in flight critical components which could result in further malfunctions and failures. However, the investigation did not confirm whether any malfunction or failure of the electronic flight display system was present at the time of the accident takeoff, other than the PFD\u2019s failure to align prior to departure.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane which was a result of spatial disorientation after takeoff into instrument conditions with an operationally degraded electronic primary flight display.  Contributing to the accident were the pilot\u2019s failure to properly utilize the airplane\u2019s standby flight instruments, the electronic primary flight display system\u2019s unaligned state prior to takeoff for undetermined reasons, and the pilot\u2019s lack of knowledge of degraded autopilot functions with an unaligned primary display system."

During the landing roll on the soft terrain, the landing gear sheared off.  After the accident, the pilot noted that one of the blades of the wooden propeller was missing.  The remaining blades and two hub plates were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for examination.  The metallurgist reported that the fretting observed on the hub plates suggested that the hub mounting bolts were not as tight as required allowing the hub to oscillate on its mounting flange.  The motion in the pitch block of both blades produced the heat that charred the wood and softened the pitch block material allowing it to be displaced and imprinted with the pattern of the wood plies.  The compression failure and the frictional features on the hub portion in the pitch block indicated a fatigue-like failure in wood which propagated until the remaining wood could not withstand the stresses of operation and subsequently failed in a tensile mode.",

The airport was hosting an airshow where the accident pilots were going to perform a formation aerobatic routine.  Witnesses observed the two airplanes practicing the routine on several different occasions during the previous months, and had become familiar with it.  They said that when the accident happened, a vertical climb was initiated with both airplanes side-by-side, and at the apex of the maneuver, one or both of the airplanes moved out of their normal positions, and they became stacked one on top of the other.  After the airplanes initial contact, witnesses observed several additional contacts as the airplanes fell to the ground.  Color transfers, damage patterns, and witness marks found that the propeller of N561ER made multiple contacts to the engine compartment and cockpit of N562ER, while contact between the left lift strut of N562ER and the empennage of N561ER damaged and separated the vertical and horizontal stabilizers of N561ER.

The flight was subsequently cleared for a visual approach to runway 09R.  The airplane was 3 miles from the runway when the crew was informed that the wind was from 020 degrees at 7 knots.  The CVR recorded crew confusion as to which runway or taxiway they were tracking towards.  Both pilots thought that they had been aligned with a taxiway, not the runway.  The tower instructed the flight to make a 360-degree turn.  The captain took control of the airplane and subsequently the flight was cleared to join the right downwind leg for runway 09R.  The captain then returned aircraft control to the first officer and continually cautioned him about excessive speed and altitude.  The first officer said his speed was 120 KIAS.  The last radar contact showed the airplane's ground speed at 138 knots.The captain said the airplane touched down on centerline and reverse thrust was selected.  The airplane then began drifting or \"pulling\" to the left.  The first officer attempted to correct with right rudder and then right brake.  As the airplane decelerated to 60 knots, the captain engaged nose wheel steering and tried to help the first officer.  The left wing then dropped and the airplane veered to the right.  The captain thought they had \"blown a tire.\"  The left main landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a halt.  The crew then evacuated the airplane.  FAA inspectors and Piaggio representatives inspected the airplane and found the left main tire had blown out and separated from its rim, and fuel was leaking from the airplane onto the runway.  The tire had a flat spot in the tread, with scuffing in an inboard-to-outboard direction.  The left main landing gear retract actuator was fractured on the upper pivot pin.  In the lower pivot area, the main gear \"drag brace\" was forced out of the mounting structure and bushing assembly.  It was their opinion that only a strong impact with abnormal side load would cause the pivot actuator area to fail,inducing excessive bending loads on the main landing gear drag brace.  This load condition could cause the tire to blow out.  The crew later reported an abnormally large number of blown tires, and that the company had attributed these blowouts to \"pilot error.\"",

Following the incident, a company mechanic removed the hydraulic pump and pulley, and found that the hydraulic pump drive shaft splines and the coupling sleeve exhibited \"excessive wear.\"  A new hydraulic pump was installed, the helicopter was test flown, and was then returned to service.  About 3 weeks later, while flying the same helicopter, the pilot experienced a similar series of events, resulting in another run-on landing and no damage to the helicopter.  Following that incident, the hydraulic system test switch was identified as faulty, and was subsequently replaced.  After a check by a mechanic and another company pilot, the helicopter was test flown with no discrepancies noted and returned to service.  Examination of the hydraulic pump drive shaft and coupling sleeve revealed that while the mating splines of both components were severely worn, there was enough spline material remaining to enable the coupling sleeve to drive the hydraulic pump.  Examination and functional testing of the hydraulic switch removed from the helicopter revealed no anomalies.",

The captain said she increased engine power and applied full left aileron and rudder, but could not gain directional or pitch control of the airplane.  The right wing struck trees, short of the runway threshold, increasing the airplane's right yaw. The captain said that as the airplane neared the ground, she pulled the engine throttles off.  The airplane struck the ground with the right main landing gear and right front portion of the fuselage.  The airplane then pivoted to the right, 180 degrees from the approach heading.  The owner of the airport reported that wind conditions from the east may produce downdrafts in the area of runway 05.  He indicated that at the time of the accident, the wind was blowing from the east about 15 knots.  The first officer reported the captain appeared to be attempting to maintain a stabilized approach angle by varying the pitch attitude of the airplane.  A review of company training literature revealed that the airplane is especially sensitive to slight wind shear, and wind gusts as low as 5 knots when operating at low airspeeds.  Pilots are cautioned that when flying the aircraft at low speeds, a large application of the aileron control may be required to maintain wings level.  During gusty wind conditions, the threshold airspeed should be increased by one-half the gust factor, and any lateral displacement should be corrected rapidly.  If a wing is allowed to drop beyond corrective action of full aileron, power should be increased immediately to regain level flight.",
            "probable_cause": "The captain's failure to maintain the proper glidepath, and improper short field landing procedures.  Factors in the accident were a downdraft, and the captain's inadequate evaluation of the weather conditions."

As the helicopter ascended about 50 to 60 feet above ground level (agl), the pilot heard two warning horns sound, followed by the helicopter yawing 90 degrees to the left. The pilot lowered the collective in an effort to preserve rotor rpm and maneuvered the helicopter back over the helipad. Around 5 to 8 feet agl the pilot increased collective pitch, but the helicopter continued a quick descent until it experienced a hard landing back on the helipad. A review of hospital video surveillance footage for the 24 hours prior to the accident revealed that the helicopter remained parked outside for approximately 5 hours in blowing snow conditions; during this time, it was not equipped with plugs or covers over the engine inlets or the exhaust. The plugs and covers were installed later and the helicopter remained outside in temperatures ranging from 16 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 34 degrees F for the next 19 hours. The video also revealed that at no time did anybody look at the exhaust stack, right side engine intake, or open any access panels prior to the operation of the helicopter. An examination of the recorded Engine Control Unit (ECU) data revealed that during the flight, the helicopter\u2019s engine experienced a momentary flameout followed by a successful relight. Although the engine power was increasing, due to the helicopter\u2019s close proximity to the ground, the pilot was unable to recover main rotor rpm before ground impact. As part of the postaccident examination, the engine was removed from the airframe and an engine run was performed. There were no anomalies found with the airframe or engine that would have contributed to the loss of engine power. The operator\u2019s procedure manual stated that the pilot must ensure that all ice, snow, and frost is removed from the engine inlet area.
