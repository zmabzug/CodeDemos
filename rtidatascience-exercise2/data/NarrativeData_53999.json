The private pilot and an airline transport-rated passenger were not injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was operated by the private pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The local flight originated at Reading Regional Airport (RDG), Reading, Pennsylvania about 1250.The private pilot, who was seated in the left cockpit seat, reported the following. She was flying the airplane in an area near her residence at 3,000 feet above mean sea level. The passenger then stated to her that they had \"\u2026lost an engine.\" The passenger, who was also a flight instructor, took control of the airplane while the pilot referenced the engine failure checklist. An attempt to restart the engine was made without success. The passenger maintained control and maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing in a nearby field. During the forced landing, undulating terrain was encountered, and the right wing struck a tree. The airplane came to a stop in a vegetable garden and the occupants exited the cockpit.An inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration responded to the accident site and examined the wreckage. The fuselage, empennage, and left wing exhibited structural damage from impact forces. The right wing was sheared off at the root. Both wing tanks contained fuel, and there was evidence of fuel leakage at the accident site. The engine was retained for further examination.",

Finding no damage, he continued the flight. After takeoff, the pilot said there was very little left rudder control. An examination of the rudder was made after the airplane landed at its destination. From the pilot's rudder pedals, the rudder is controlled by a cable which makes a 180-degree turn toward the tail via two phenolic pulleys.  Each pulley has two guard pins, which keep the cable from jumping off the pulleys if the cable becomes slack. The inspection showed that the cable had jumped off the upper pulley. The pulley's upper guard pin had retracted, and did not prevent the cable from jumping off the pulley. The guard pin has a perforated and deformed end, giving it a spring action which secures the pin after passing through the holes on either side of the pulley bracket.  No service difficulty reports were found for the pins, and the pins do not have any service life limits. An examination of the operator's other, similar model airplanes, showed that several of their guard pins had also retracted. Evidence suggests that the pin's locking action becomes weakened and ineffective by repeated use.  The operator submitted a service difficulty report, and as a result of this incident, the manufacturer has published service letters 226-SL-037, 227-SL052, and CC7-SL-045.

The pilot reported the low oil pressure condition to Augusta Approach, and they vectored him towards the Burke City Airport. The pilot reduced power and started his descent. The pilot stated that the engine began surging then \"quit/seized followed by smoke billowing out from the engine cowling.\" The pilot declared an emergency to Augusta Approach and decided to make an off airport landing.

The pilot stated that he was not injured, and was also unable to contact Augusta Approach either by radio or cell phone. The pilot stated that he walked about 1/4 mile until he could get a signal on his cell phone to report the accident. According to the airplane owner/operator, a mechanic had installed an engine oil quick drain prior to the flight. The mechanic was unaware that a quick drain was not recommended for installation on the PA-28R,  as a result when the pilot retracted the landing gear after takeoff, the nose gear compressed the quick drain allowing the engine oil to drain out during the pilot's flight. According to the operator, after the accident the president of the company directed that all shop employees be given instruction in regards to why quick drains should not be installed on PA-28R Piper Arrows.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the flight that originated about 0620 from Pottstown Municipal Airport, Pottstown, Pennsylvania.According to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector-in-charge (FAA-IIC), the pilot was attempting to land in an open field of newly planted corn at the time of the accident.One passenger reported they were given landing instructions by the pilot which included to crouch down and hold onto a rope. The passenger indicated the pilot informed them he was attempting to contact the top of trees to slow the balloon, but in fact the balloon cleared the trees. The basket rocked back and forth on the ground several times, and the passenger noted the pilot reached for a rope but somehow lost his balance and fell out of the basket. When the basket came to rest, another passenger pulled a rope, and she yelled for all to get out of the basket. She and her daughter went to the pilot, and then ran to a nearby residence to summon help.",

Instantly after, the right engine lost power and the pilot feathered both engines.  The airplane then impacted a 70-foot high tree and collided with the ground about 1,000 feet short of the runway.  The 700-hour pilot reported that he activated the electric fuel boost pumps and switched the fuel selectors from the auxiliary fuel tank positions to the main fuel tank positions, about 17 miles from the airport.  He recalled that the fuel gauges indicated approximately 70 gallons of fuel in the main tank and about 10-15 gallons of fuel in the auxiliary tanks.  The original installed fuel system was configured with a center tank and two outboard tanks.  The center tank was composed of five, interconnected rubber cells, having a total capacity of 150 to 159 US gallons.  Each outboard fuel tank was composed of two fuel cells with a combined capacity of 33.5 gallons.  The total of the two outboard fuel tanks (four cells) was 67 gallons, providing a total usable capacity of 233 gallons.  Each engine had its own fuel shutoff switch.  Rotating a switch to the RIGHT OUTBOARD or LEFT OUTBOARD position allows fuel from the outboard tanks to flow to the respective engine and shuts off fuel from the center tank.  Rotating a fuel shutoff switch to the CENTER position allows fuel to flow from the center tank to the respective engine, and shuts off flow from the respective outboard tank.  Rotating the switch to the OFF position shuts off all fuel flow to the respective engine.  There was no cross-feed configuration of the switches.  Documentation was found in the historical records that indicated extended range fuel system modifications, however, the information was incomplete.  After review of all available records and examination of the wreckage, it was determined that the fuel system configuration/capacity of the airplane at the time of the accident was:  156 gallons for the center tank system; 67 gallons for the outboard wing tanks; and a set of auxiliary tanks capable of holding 21 gallons (records of installation unknown).  The total usable fuel capacity was estimated at 244 gallons.  Cockpit fuel selector positions were: LEFT Fuel Shut Off Valve Selector-LEFT HAND OUTBOARD; LEFT Fuel Boost Pump-OFF; LEFT Engine Primer-OFF; LEFT Ignition Switch-RIGHT; RIGHT Fuel Shut Off Valve Selector-RIGHT HAND OUTBOARD; RIGHT Fuel Boost Pump-ON; RIGHT Engine Primer-OFF; RIGHT Ignition Switch-BOTH.  Airframe fuel shutoff valves were found in the following positions (Each valve position corresponded to the cockpit selectors):  Right Wing Auxiliary-OPEN; Right Wing Main-CLOSED; Left Wing Auxiliary-OPEN; Left Wing Main-CLOSED.  A total of 37.5 gallons of usable fuel was drained from the uncompromised tanks (unknown amount had leaked at the accident site).  Excerpts from the \" Normal Procedures\" section of the flight manual regarding fuel selector positions for take off and landing:  \"CAUTION; Burn center tank fuel first, when 100 gallons is shown on center tank gauge, switch to outboard tanks.  Do not allow engine to be starved of fuel when outboard tanks run dry.  Select center tanks at first indication of fuel pressure loss.  Fuel boost pumps must be on when switching tanks.\"  The \"BEFORE LANDING CHECK\" procedures in the aircraft flight manual state that the Fuel Selector Valves must be in the \"CENTER TANK\" position before the approach.  The manufacturer stated that the simultaneous loss of power of both engines was likely a result of the outboard fuel tanks unporting.  No mechanical anomalies were found during examination of the engines or airframe, and usable fuel was available in the center tank at the time of the accident. ",

The airplane was registered to Steelesky Ltd., and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.  The private pilot, who was seated in the front seat, and the airline transport rated pilot, who was seated in the rear seat, were seriously injured.

The cross-country flight originated from Prescott, Arizona, about 20 minutes prior to the accident.During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, the front seat pilot reported that while the flight was inbound to SEZ, the engine began running rough, and through adjusting the mixture, it returned to running normal.  The pilot stated that after switching to the right fuel tank, he proceeded to enter the airport traffic pattern on a right base for runway 3.  As he turned onto about a 3-mile final for the runway, the airplane descended below his intended flight path and he added power, however, noticed that the engine was not responding.

According to data from the multifunction display, the oil pressure was in the normal green arc range (30 to 60 psi) during the entire flight. After landing, no maintenance or servicing was performed. Before takeoff for the accident flight, the pilot performed a walk-around inspection of the airplane, which would require, in part, a check of the oil quantity.According to GPS and other recorded flight data, about 17 minutes after takeoff, the oil pressure decreased below the lower end of the normal operating range; at the time, the airplane was flying in an easterly direction about 10 nautical miles west of an airport with runways of more-than-adequate length for the pilot to divert. Rather than divert, the pilot continued toward the destination. Although the oil temperature remained in the normal operating range, the oil pressure continued to decrease. Both indications would have been available to the pilot either on the multifunction display or on the analog combination oil pressure/oil temperature gauge.While the airplane continued toward the destination, the oil pressure decreased to 10 psi, and the pilot maintained the engine power setting at 2,400 rpm (the maximum setting is 2,700 rpm). About 46 minutes after takeoff, with the engine rpm still set at 2,400 rpm, the pilot declared an emergency and advised the controller that smoke was coming from the engine. Unable to fly to suggested airports, the pilot initiated an approach for a forced landing to a large open area containing east/west- and north/south-oriented paved roads.Witnesses reported that the engine was sputtering and \u201ccoughing\u201d but did not note smoke trailing the airplane. For the last 1 minute 12 seconds of flight, the engine rpm decreased from 2,400 to 1,700. While descending with the autopilot disengaged and at 74 knots indicated airspeed, the airplane banked 55 degrees to the right, stalled, pitched nose-down, and impacted the ground.Examination of the wreckage revealed oil covering the bottom left side of the fuselage from the engine firewall to the tailcone, consistent with the crankcase being pressurized and blowing oil out of the air/oil separator. Examination of the engine revealed that the oil gauge rod and cap assembly had separated from the oil filler tube and was found near the engine and propeller impact crater. Neither the oil gauge rod and cap assembly nor the oil filler breather tube were impact damaged, suggesting that the assembly was improperly secured. Although the No. 4 cylinder piston was fractured and the fracture surfaces exhibited widely spaced crack propagation marks consistent with progressive crack growth under cyclic stresses, the cyclic load was at or above the yield strength of the material. Therefore, the No. 4 cylinder piston did not contribute to the loss of engine oil supply. Examination of the ignition, lubrication, air induction, and fuel injection systems did not note any discrepancies that contributed to the catastrophic failure of the engine.The catastrophic failure of the engine was consistent with oil starvation due to the crankcase becoming pressurized because of an unsecured oil gauge rod and cap assembly. Postaccident examination of the pistons, piston rings, and crankshaft nose seal did not indicate other typical scenarios of crankcase pressurization. A previous NTSB accident investigation of a different airplane with the same engine model determined that an unsecured oil cap allowed the crankcase to become pressurized and the oil to be vented overboard, causing subsequent catastrophic failure of the engine due to oil starvation.The pilot\u2019s decision to continue the flight with decreasing or low oil pressure rather than land at a suitable airport nearby and his continued operation of the engine at a high rpm setting contradicted the emergency procedures section of the pilot operating handbook and Federal Aviation Administration-approved flight manual, which contributed to the catastrophic failure of the engine.Although the airplane was equipped with an airframe parachute, an acquaintance of the pilot reported that the pilot would only use it in the event of a structural issue that rendered the airplane uncontrollable. Otherwise, if it were controllable, the pilot intended to hand-fly the airplane to landing. If the pilot had deployed the airframe parachute, he may have increased the likelihood of a successful emergency landing.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering for a forced landing, resulting in an inadvertent aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident were the pilot\u2019s failure to secure the oil gauge rod and cap assembly before flight and his decision not to land immediately following loss of oil pressure, which resulted in the total loss of engine power due to oil starvation."

The pilot secured the engine and made a precautionary landing.  The airplane sustained substantial damage during the forced landing to a field.  A review of aircraft maintenance records revealed that the airplane experienced a gear-up landing in January 2002, which resulted in a propeller strike.  The left engine was removed and inspected per the manufacturer's overhaul manual and returned to service.  The engine had accrued approximately 440 hours since it was overhauled.  Examination of the engine revealed that the entire three-bladed propeller assembly and the #1 cylinder had separated from the engine.  The engine was disassembled and the crankshaft, along with an intact #3 connecting rod assembly and the fractured #2 connecting rod assembly were examined by a Safety Board Materials Engineer.  The crankshaft was fractured in two places; one fracture was just forward of the #3 rod journal in the crank cheek, and the other fracture was in the aft crank cheek adjacent to the #2 main journal.  The interior surface of the #1 and #2 main bearing halves exhibited significant rubbing and a portion of the bearing liner material was delaminated and was missing from the forward end of the bearing.  On the oil slinger face, just forward of the #1 main journal, 360 degree rubbing damage was noted just outboard of the radius.  In the rub region, metallic transfer was present with a color consistent with aluminum material.  No evidence of radial cracks was observed in this area.  An exact determination for the crankshaft failure could not be determined; however, evidence supported two possibilities that could have attributed to its demise.  One possibility was that the crankshaft fracture initiated from rubbing damage between the crank cheek aft of the #2 main journal (thrust face) and the crankcase, with the other fatigue region being secondary. The exact cause for the rubbing was not clear, but one possibility was that the bearing liner delaminated and liberated a section causing a reduction in the clearance between the crankshaft and the crankcase as it was rubbing/exiting through the oil slinger.  The other possibility was that the propeller strike caused the rubbing/cracking to occur, which was not detected during the subsequent overhaul/inspection.",

This was the first time that the pilot had flown this make and model of helicopter in the manual mode. When the pilot performed left and right 360-degree hovering turns, he found it difficult to rotate the twist grip but was able to manipulate it and maintain main rotor rpm (NR) within normal limits. The instructor then asked the pilot to perform a left, closed traffic pattern back to the departure airport. The pilot and the instructor reported that the takeoff, transition into cruise flight on the downwind leg, and initial descent were uneventful. The pilot reported that the helicopter was on final approach below 400 feet above ground level (agl) when he noticed that the NR was decreasing. He rotated the twist grip to increase power, but the NR continued to decrease. The low NR audio warning then sounded, and the instructor joined the pilot on the controls. The two pilots lowered the collective to enter an autorotation. The pilot said that the NR never recovered to the normal range even though the twist grip was rotated to its maximum (full-open) position. The flight instructor reported that the helicopter was about 200 to 300 feet agl when the NR began to decrease rapidly. The instructor stated that he took the controls and attempted to roll on more throttle but found that the throttle was already fully open. He said that he lowered the collective in an attempt to conserve NR. Both pilots reported that they pulled up on the collective to cushion the landing but that insufficient NR was remaining to slow the descent. The helicopter landed hard, slid forward on the taxiway, and yawed about 90 degrees left. The instructor reported that, when the helicopter came to a stop, the engine was not running, and the pilot reported that he was unaware of the engine\u2019s status.Postaccident examination revealed no binding or other anomalies with the operation of the manual throttle control system or the throttle friction control wheel on the right (pilot\u2019s side) collective. Neither the helicopter\u2019s vehicle engine multifunction display nor its digital engine control unit recorded any faults for the accident flight. The engine was installed in a test cell, started, and tested in both automatic and manual governor modes, and no anomalies or uncommanded shutdowns were experienced, and the engine\u2019s performance met the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.Given the engine\u2019s satisfactory performance during the postaccident test run and the lack of mechanical anomalies with the manual throttle control system, it is likely that the pilot receiving instruction mismanaged the twist grip throttle control during the approach, which led to a decay in NR. The instructor apparently did not notice the decay in NR until the low NR audio warning sounded, at which point, the helicopter was at too low an altitude to correct the situation.",

Weather was not a factor.  At the time of the accident, the flight was not communicating with any tower or air traffic facility.  Communications could have aided in initiating rescue and fire-fighting operations if a check-in schedule with KAFW tower or other facility or agency had been established.  Facilities affected the accident, because there were no extinguishers or other fire-fighting equipment at the accident site, which was a usual autorotative training area.   There was pilot-stated evidence that there may have been a power-related or other control problem with the accident helicopter, becoming apparent at a most critical time, that is, during power-on recover from a demonstrated autorotation.  Specific evidence came from the interview and statement of a DEA Special Agent/Pilot, who on September 14, 1998, took the TP on a demonstration flight in the accident helicopter, prior to the TP beginning the OH-6A transition syllabus.  The Special Agent/Pilot's written statement to the accident investigation, stated in part, 'The aircraft was flared, forward momentum was checked, and the aircraft was leveled as it started to descend toward the ground.  At this time, collective was applied in order to recover to a three foot hover.  I was surprised at the engine's reaction.  I perceived a delay followed by an engine surge which created a significant yaw to the right.' Also, following his initial statement,  when asked about the availability of power during recovery from the practice autorotations, the TP emphatically stated, 'Make sure you check that engine.'  The engine was disassembled for an engineering examination and report  under Safety Board IIC-oversight at Rolls Royce Allison, Indianapolis.  In a similar manner, the main gearbox, transmission drive shaft, and overriding clutch were disassembled and subjected to engineering examinations and a report at the Boeing facility, Mesa, Arizona.  The components examined at the two facilities were not severely fire-damaged. The engine, upon disassembly, evidenced that it was capable of producing power at the time of impact.  The examinations of the main gearbox/overriding clutch systems showed no evidence of pre-impact damage and evidenced the ability to turn normally prior to impact.  However, because of extensive fire damage or destruction to the fuel cells and related fuel lines, that system was not capable of being subjected to similar engineering examinations.   Following a request at the beginning of the interview that he initially describe the event in his own words, and a few questions would then follow, the TP described a series of events that began after he made the comment regarding a '50 foot area,' in which the IP quickly  took control of the helicopter, entered a climbing turn, leveled out, and then initiated an abrupt, steep angle of bank, and steep approach to a final in which the TP, 'hoped there would be enough at the end.'  The impact site showed tail rotor blade strikes, first, evidencing a high nose attitude at impact.  A high nose attitude at impact may indicate that, if the helicopter were responding to control inputs, the pilot was still attempting to arrest momentum.    The IP was involved in an incident on November 3, 1995, in which the DEA Aviation Section Incident Form states, he 'took control of the A/C and said that he would demonstrate a zero airspeed autorotation.'  That description is similar to the IP taking control of the accident helicopter following the TP's statement.  The 1995 incident report continues, the IP 'then entered the maneuver and began explaining a proper procedure.  At approx. 70' AGL [he] began to flare the A/C at which point [he] stated, 'I forgot to roll the throttle in.''  The autorotative recovery continued as an overtorque.  'As the A/C began to level at approx. [? feet] I noticed the torque gauge indicate past 120 [percent] at which point the maneuver was terminated [in] a hover.'    The 1995 incident report leaves questions unanswered, but '120 percent' [an overtorque] raises a question whether an overtorque was necessary to recover, and 'terminate in a hover.'    The IP was the only OH-6A instructor pilot for the DEA at KAFW.  However, an interview with the training officer evidenced a lack of scheduled standardization meetings or procedures involving unit IPs, regardless of models, or involving the accident IP and the other OH-6A pilots in command that were based at KAFW.  Scheduled standardization meetings should have been even more useful than normally expected, in that the flight operations manual was essentially copied from the U.S. Army manual, and, as the DEA training officer confirmed, under specific instructor pilot and transition pilot performance criteria, there was no more precise writing than that which was found in the OH-6 Pilot Transition lesson plan, which stated, 'Introduce Autorotations.' ",
            "probable_cause": "Failure of the Instructor Pilot to control the helicopter's rate of descent during a demonstrated autorotation. Contributing to the accident were the Operator's lack of:  a.  \tInstructor Pilot standardization procedures, and   b. \tSpecific or adequate flight demonstration procedures and techniques for both instructor and transition pilots.

Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing.Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position.  Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer.  The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet.  However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway.  The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt. The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplane\u2019s loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow.  At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and  engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it.Following the accident, the manufacturer issued an Airplane Flight Manual revision that changed the name of the \u201cInadvertent Stow of Thrust Reverser During Landing Rollout\u201d abnormal procedure to \u201cInadvertent Stow of Thrust Reverser After a Crew-Commanded Deployment\u201d and moved it into the emergency procedures section.[ This Brief of Accident was modified on April 5, 2010, based on information obtained during NTSB Case No. DCA08MA098. ]",

The R22 pilot had been practicing at a helipad north of runway 29R, and was returning to his parking area on the ramp south of runway 29L.  The R44 pilot was departing from runway 29L on a touch-and-go.  The R22 was above the R44, and descending to the southwest while the R44 was climbing straight ahead on runway 29L at the time of the collision.  A tower controller instructed the R22 pilot to hold when he requested to go from the helipad to parking.  After traffic passed, the controller advised him that he could proceed in right traffic flying a downwind traffic pattern for runway 29R to the helipad.  The R22 pilot requested takeoff to land at his parking area.  The controller instructed him to fly westbound.  A few seconds later, the controller cleared the R44 pilot for the touch-and-go option on runway 29L, and in the same transmission cleared the R22 pilot to make a right turn to the downwind on runway 29R.

The flight was carrying six passengers and was being conducted in visual meteorological conditions at dawn. After a normal start, taxi-out, and engine run-up, the airplane departed using the full length of the 8,000-ft-long runway. About 4 minutes after takeoff, the pilot radioed the air traffic control tower that he wanted to \u201ccome back in for an immediate landing\u201d; the airplane landed uneventfully on the departure runway about 3 minutes later. The airplane exited the runway at the first taxiway, situated about 3,150 ft past the runway threshold, and the pilot subsequently conducted an engine run-up. The pilot returned to the runway and initiated an intersection takeoff using the 5,550 ft of remaining runway. About 45 seconds after the pilot began the takeoff, the airplane experienced a partial loss of engine power, so he began a second turnback. During the turnback, the airplane stalled at low altitude and impacted airport property near the end of a runway parallel to the departure runway. A postimpact fire ensued; one passenger did not exit the airplane and died. \u000b\u000bThe pilot did not recall making the first turnback, and the investigation was unable to determine the reason for the first turnback. One passenger reported that the pilot was using his mobile telephone at an inappropriate time during the beginning of the flight, and two other passengers reported that the cabin door became unlatched at some point during the flight. Neither passenger reported that any door problems occurred after the second takeoff. Although there was no evidence to support the passengers\u2019 allegations regarding the telephone or the cabin door events, an airline representative suggested that the first turnback was conducted due to the door coming open and that the subsequent engine run-up was conducted to conceal the actual reason for the turnback. The representative added that the second turnback may have been due to the pilot\u2019s distraction and loss of situational awareness as he attempted to relatch the door that might have become unlatched again. \u000b\u000bPostaccident on-site wreckage examination and test runs and examination of the engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical deficiencies that could be directly linked to the power loss. Although anomalies with the engine-driven fuel pump and one magneto were detected during their respective examinations, the units performed satisfactorily during bench testing. However, there were a sufficient number of undetermined details regarding the preimpact configuration and condition of the airframe and the engine to preclude a determination of the preaccident functionality and airworthiness of the airplane. Those details included the magneto-to-engine timing, the internal timing of the right magneto, the fuel selector valve takeoff setting, and the fuel quantity in the selected tank. \u000b\u000bReview of airplane performance data indicated that the 5,550 ft of runway beyond the taxiway intersection was more than sufficient for the takeoff. The performance data showed a rapid roll into a sustained bank angle during the turnback, which did not support the airline\u2019s scenario that the airplane veered off course due to the pilot\u2019s loss of situational awareness. The investigation was unable to determine the initiation altitude of the turnback or whether there was sufficient altitude for the safe execution of such a maneuver. However, deductions of the airplane location, altitude, and heading based on the ground scar information indicated that a safe landing would not have been possible from the point in the flightpath where the airplane stalled. Neither the airline nor the airplane manufacturer provided any specific guidance to pilots regarding minimum safe turnback altitudes. \u000b\u000bThe pilot\u2019s decision to conduct an intersection takeoff, instead of a full-runway-length takeoff, left 3,150 ft less runway. Although he did not state it explicitly, the apparent reason that the pilot opted for the intersection takeoff was for schedule expediency, by obviating the need for the extra few minutes required to taxi back for a full-runway-length takeoff. Based on the accident flightpath, the additional 3,150 ft of runway likely would have been sufficient to enable a straight-ahead landing after the power loss rather than a turnback. By foregoing the taxi-back, the pilot reduced his margin of safety by decreasing his options in the event of an engine anomaly or power loss. Review of aerial imagery revealed that, beyond the airport\u2019s northeast boundaries, there were very few locations suitable for an emergency landing following a low-altitude power loss, which likely contributed to the pilot\u2019s decision to attempt to return to the airport. Although the airline published the preferred flight tracks between the two airports that it primarily served, it did not provide any guidance regarding preferred flightpaths or emergency landing sites following an engine failure at low altitude.

            "probable_cause": "A partial\u00a0loss of engine power shortly after takeoff for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation and the pilot\u2019s failure to maintain airplane control during the unsuccessful attempt to return for landing on the airport.\u00a0Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s decision to conduct his second takeoff using less than the full runway length available and the airline\u2019s lack of guidance regarding how to respond to engine failures at low altitudes.\u00a0"

Discussions with the owner/builder of the airplane and the pilot disclosed they believed the engine may have lost power due to fuel starvation related to siphoning of fuel from the forward tanks to the rear tanks, or possibly inadequate fuel tank venting.  The pilot also noted that carburetor icing conditions were prevalent the day of the accident, and although he used carburetor heat prior to takeoff, carburetor ice may have been a factor.

While on final approach, the aircraft's turbine engine lost power and the pilot executed a forced landing to a dry rice field short of the airstrip.  During the initial landing roll, the left main landing gear struck a dirt embankment which resulted in the left wing impacting the ground.  According to the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) the pilot reported he departed the airport with 55 gallons of fuel on-board.  The FAA inspector, who responded to the accident scene, examined the airplane and found no fuel in the fuel system.

The pilot had completed four landings on the first day he flew this aircraft, and had done one other landing on the day of the accident. On his second attempt, while trying to execute a three-point (full-stall) landing, he inadvertently allowed the main gear to touch the runway first, and then the aircraft bounced back into the air. It then touched down in a three-point attitude, but began to veer off to the left. The pilot corrected to the right, but as he tried to make the correction, the aircraft continued to turn toward the right edge of the runway. Ultimately he put in full left rudder and a significant amount of left brake in an attempt to get the aircraft realigned with the runway, but these inputs were not sufficient to correct the situation. As the aircraft got near the right edge of the runway, the flight instructor came on the controls in and attempt to regain control of the aircraft, but it departed the side of the runway and encountered soft terrain. Because the left main gear tire had gone flat as the aircraft was sliding sideways on the runway surface, when that wheel encountered the soft terrain, the aircraft rocked up onto the left main gear strut, and the wing contacted the ground. There were no brakes on the side of the aircraft that the instructor was sitting on.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.The pilot stated that the airplane was in left orbit over the advertising destination at 1,200 feet agl. The airplane began to shake violently, and lose altitude. The pilot immediately initiated a right turn away from the banner pattern. A power reduction to idle alleviated the violent shaking. The pilot made an emergency radio call on the Bermuda Dunes common traffic advisory frequency, began looking for a safe place to drop the banner, and maneuvered to release it over an empty fairway at a golf course at 600 agl.The pilot advanced the throttle, and noted that the severe vibration returned at the higher engine rpm.

The commercial pilot three passengers were fatally injured and the airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to and operated by TLT and GGBB LLC. as a personal flight. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from Peachtree DeKalb Airport (PDK), Chamblee, Georgia, about 1008 eastern daylight time and was destined for University-Oxford Airport (UOX), Oxford, Mississippi. A review of the air traffic control (ATC) transcript revealed that the pilot contacted clearance delivery for an IFR clearance. ATC provided the clearance, which included radar vectors, and \"climb and maintain 3,000; expect 8,000 in 10 minutes.\" The pilot read back the clearance correctly, and confirmed that he had the most recent automatic terminal information service (ATIS), which was information \"Whiskey.\" The pilot contacted ground control, and indicated that he was ready to taxi. Ground control instructed the pilot to taxi for runway 3R, via bravo, hold short 3L, and the pilot read back the instructions correctly. The pilot then contacted the tower controller informing them that he was holding short 3L and ready. The tower controller instructed the pilot to \"fly heading 360 and cleared for takeoff.\" The pilot then questioned the controller regarding which runway to take off from and the controller cleared the pilot for takeoff from runway 3L. Approximately two minutes after departure the tower controller called the pilot to verify heading. The pilot responded \"zero-two-victor, I'm having some problem climbing here.\" Followed by \"zero-two-victor; were going down here at the intersection.\" This was the last transmission made by the pilot.  A witness stated that he was about 2,300 feet off the departure end of the runway. He stopped to look at the airplane because it was moving extremely slow and only 75-100 feet above ground level when it went over his head. He went on to say that the engine sounded normal and despite the slow speed the airplane was not \"wobbling\" left to right. He continued to watch the airplane as it flew out of his view.First responders to the accident site located the airplane in the eastbound lane of interstate 285, approximately 2 miles north of PDK. There were ground scars across four traffic lanes that ended at a 5 foot concrete highway divider where the airplane came to rest. The airplane was found fragmented and a post-crash fire ensued. The wreckage path was on a heading of 021 degrees magnetic, at coordinates 33\u00b054'44.12\"N, 84\u00b017'8.46\"W.",

The survey crew had completed their survey, and the pilot, who was the only occupant, was relocating the helicopter to the operator's base in south central Alaska; however, poor weather conditions delayed his departure until mid-afternoon on the fourth day. The pilot made two fuel stops while en route, and both fuel vendors noted that the pilot seemed rushed and that he mentioned that he was trying to get to his destination before dark. The operator reported the helicopter overdue when the helicopter failed to arrive and they were unable to make contact with the pilot. Searchers discovered the fragmented wreckage about 7 miles southwest of the destination airport, in an area of marshy, tundra-covered terrain.Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport before the accident, and transient snow showers and reduced visibility were reported in the area just after the accident. Examination of the helicopter and engine revealed no preaccident mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The debris path and extensive fuselage fragmentation were consistent with the helicopter impacting terrain at high speed.The pilot's autopsy revealed several heart abnormalities, including an enlarged heart, a 90-percent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, a 99-percent occlusion of the right coronary artery, and an aortic valve that was severely calcified and stenotic. Such findings would have put the pilot at high risk of a sudden cardiac event, including acute myocardial infarction, syncope, or arrhythmia, any of which would have impaired or incapacitated him. Further, the weather and the pilot's rush to reach his destination by nightfall after a 4-day delay may have contributed to the pilot's stress level, increasing the risk that his severe but undiagnosed heart disease would cause an acute medical event during the flight. Given the lack of mechanical deficiencies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter, and the pilot's severe coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis, it is likely that the pilot's medical conditions caused sudden impairment or incapacitation, which resulted in the loss of control of the helicopter. Although it is possible that the pilot did not recognize that he was flying the helicopter in a shallow descent into terrain, the overwhelming evidence of heart disease compounded by stress makes it more likely that the pilot was impaired or incapacitated.",

Witnesses saw the retardant exit the airplane; however, the drop was not at the desired point, and not distributed in an even line as the pilot's previous drops had been.  The drop angled about 10 degrees to the final approach course.  The drop pattern was wide and heavy at the beginning, and narrow and thin at the end.  This indicated that the pilot initiated the drop early while turning onto final.  About 2 seconds after the drop, the nose of the airplane pitched up slightly, which was normal after a drop.  The nose of the airplane then pitched down about 45 degrees.  The airplane maintained this attitude until ground impact.  A prominent bend of the propeller shaft and a twist in the vertical splines indicated that the engine was generating high power.  Post flight examination of the wreckage did not reveal any anomalies with the flight control system.  Stall speeds with vortex generators installed varied from 73 mph in the clean configuration to 72 mph with full flaps.  Drop techniques, airspeed, and flap settings varied among Dromadier pilots.  Some pilots flew at airspeeds of 85 to 90 mph to lesson the pitch up on pull out.  The M-18 operator's manual indicated that, with the sudden shift in CG at retardant release, the airplane would pitch up, and airspeed could decrease as much as 12 mph.",

A Federal Aviation Administration inspector said the airplane's clam shell gear doors remained in the closed position, which is inconsistent with the landing gear being in an intransit operating mode, and the gear select handle was found in the DOWN position. The left main landing gear's inboard clevis, which secures the left gear's inboard hydraulic actuator to the gear's trunnion boss, was fractured. It had been installed incorrectly and had missed the barrel nut, which retains the clevis in the trunnion. When removed, the clevis bolt rotated relatively easily and the nut appeared to be incorrectly located. Maintenance personnel who had installed the clevis during the previous inspection, 26 days and 13 operating hours before the accident, stated that the breakage of the clevis pin would not be caused by the installation. A metallurgical examination of the fracture region revealed that the clevis failed during a single bending overstress event. No preexisting cracks or corrosion were noted at the fracture and the laboratory could not determine an underlying reason for the overstress fracture. The main landing gear is retained in the down and locked position by hydraulic pressure being applied to the inboard main landing gear actuating cylinder, as well as being assisted by the outboard main landing gear (hydraulic-pneumatic) actuating cylinder. Additionally, bungee cords attached to the main landing gear drag braces assures that the main landing gear is locked and retained in the down position. As a result of these redundant features that are designed to ensure that the main landing gear is locked in the down position, the gear collapse cannot be positively attributed to the failure of the clevis. An inspection of the right main landing gear's components failed to reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. After the failed clevis was replaced, multiple landing gear retraction and extension cycles were performed with no anomalies noted. The reason for the gear collapse was undetermined.",

The airplane was destroyed during a post-impact fire.  The pilot selected runway 11 for the takeoff.  The wind at the time of the accident was 300 degrees magnetic at 10 knots.  The airplane was approximately 189 lbs over the certified maximum gross weight at the beginning of the flight.  No anomalies were found with the airplane or its flight control systems that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.  No anomalies were found with the engine or its related systems that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.",
            "probable_cause": "Aircraft control not being maintained during initial climb resulting in a stall/mush.  Factors to the accident were the pilot's inadequate preflight planning/preparation, the pilot operating over the airplane's certified maximum gross weight, and the pilot selecting the wrong runway which resulted in a downwind takeoff."

THE PLT ENTERED AN AUTOROTATION & SELECTED A LANDING AREA. HE NOTED THAT THE ENG WAS NOT DRIVING THE ROTOR SYS, SO HE SHUT IT DOWN TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRE WHILE LANDING. DURING AN EMERGENCY LANDING ON SLOPING, MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN, THE HELICOPTER ROLLED OVER, AND SUBSEQUENTLY, IT CAME TO REST IN A RAVINE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE. A TEARDOWN OF THE ENG REVEALED THAT THE #3 BEARING, PN 4-301-051-02, HAD FAILED & THAT THE OIL JET FOR THE BEARING WAS CLOGGED. REPORTEDLY, MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL WERE AWARE THAT A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CHECK, TO DETECT CLOGGING TO THE #2 & #3 PACKAGED OIL JETS, WAS 7 TO 8 PSI. THIS WAS 2 TO 3 PSI TOO HIGH & INDICATED CLOGGING OF THE OIL JETS. (THIS PROCEDURE WAS OUTLINED IN LYCOMING SVC BULLETIN LTS101A-17-0014). HOWEVER, THE DISCREPANCY WAS NOT ENTERED IN THE ENG MAINTENANCE LOGS. ",
