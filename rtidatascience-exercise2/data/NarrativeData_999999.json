The pilot had been informed by an air traffic controller to expect the ILS/DME RWY 17 instrument approach into his destination airport.  The  pilot acknowledged and the controller began to provide altitudes and headings to join the approach\u2019s localizer signal.  However, a review of the radar data revealed that instead of tracking the localizer, the single-engine airplane  began a series of left and right hand climbing and descending turns along the localizer course before initiating a descending right hand turn to the west before the data ended.  At that time, the airplane's altitude was 1,900 feet msl, and its ground speed was 173 knots.  A witness, who was a commercial pilot in hot-air balloons, heard the sound of an airplane engine \"revving up\" and observed the airplane as it exited the 500-600 foot overcast layer.  He said the airplane was in a descending (45-degree nose down) turn until it impacted the ground.  Weather at the time of the accident was visibility 4 statute miles, mist, and a ceiling of 600 feet broken, and overcast 1,200 feet. Toxicological testing conducted on the pilot  was negative for alcohol, carbon monoxide, and illegal drugs.  However, the testing did detect the drugs doxazosin (which had been prescribed for an enlarged prostate) in the kidney and liver, doxylamine (an over-the-counter antihistamine with sedative effects) in the kidney and liver, and trimethoprim (a prescription antibiotic) in the liver.  No blood was available for testing.  According to a family member, the pilot had been complaining of headaches prior to the accident that the pilot thought may have been due to a sinus infection, and had been taking Nasonex (a prescription nasally inhaled steroid) regularly at the time of the accident.  The family member also noted that the pilot had taken Alka-Seltzer Plus approximately 12 hours prior to the accident flight.  The pilot's last application for Airman Medical Certificate in January 2005 had indicated the use of medications, but had not detailed the medications used.  According to the autopsy report, \"...The cause of death could not be determined.  This is, at least, in part due to the severe traumatic injury of the body with destruction of vital organs precluding their examination.  In addition, from the investigative information, it is not clear whether [the pilot] was alive or dead as the plane descended to the ground.\"",

Smithfield in Beaufort, North Carolina. The pilot felt that the fuel gauges were unreliable and used a home made dipstick to dip the fuel tanks. He reported that he had 35 gallons of fuel onboard. From previous flights the pilot estimated that 17 gallons of fuel was all that would be required to make the trip. The pilot stated that he had recently had a new engine installed with instructions to operate it with the mixture in the full rich setting during the break-in period, so the flight was conducted with the mixture set in this position. He said that unexpected headwinds were encountered at his cruising altitude of 5,500 feet. He stated that he was originally on the left main tank when the engine sputtered and quit, at this point after checking the fuel gauges, he switched to the right main tank and called air traffic control at Cherry Point, North Carolina for flight following to Craven County Airport in New Bern, North Carolina. After about three minutes of operation on the right tank, the engine began sputtering and quit, the pilot then switched the fuel selector to each of the four tanks individually but was unable to restart the engine. The New Bern tower had authorized an emergency landing on any runway and had alerted the airport fire and rescue vehicles. During his descent the pilot raised his flaps from the approach setting to zero, this resulted in a greater sink rate. Unable to make the runway, the airplane contacted the downhill side of a knoll at 100 mph, and bounced 195 feet where it contacted the ground and stopped short of runway 04. The pilot was uninjured and during a subsequent interview he readily admitted that the engine was running fine when it lost power and that he ran out of fuel.

On the day of the accident, the pilot acquired another computer generated text weather briefing, and then contacted the Flight Service Station (FSS) for an interactive telephonic weather briefing. The information provided in all three briefings indicated that a flight on a direct route between the pilot's point of departure and his planned destination would take him through an area of forecast rain showers, thunderstorms, and cloud tops significantly higher than his intended en route altitude. Although the FSS briefer recommended an alternate route, for which he provided weather information, after departure the pilot flew directly toward his destination airport. While en route, the pilot, who was not instrument rated, encountered instrument meteorological conditions, within which there was an 80 percent probability of icing. After entering the area of instrument meteorological conditions, the airplane was seen exiting the bottom of an overcast cloud layer with a significant portion of its left wing missing. It then made a high velocity steep descent into the terrain. A postaccident inspection of the airplane's structure did not find any evidence of an anomaly that would contribute to the separation of the wing structure, and it is most likely that the wing section separated as a result of the airplane exceeding its structural limitations after the pilot lost control in the instrument meteorological conditions.",

The commercial pilot who was the sole occupant was fatally injured. The airplane sustained substantial wing and fuselage damage. The airplane was registered to and operated by Bag Flying Club Inc. under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day visual flight rules conditions prevailed for the flight, which did not operate on a flight plan. The local flight originated from DTN at time unknown.According to preliminary information given to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the airplane had been observed performing touch and go landings on runway 23. During the accident takeoff, the airplane was observed in a nose high attitude. The airplane subsequently rolled to the left, nosed over, and impacted the ground with its left wing. The airplane cartwheeled on its nose and came to rest pointing back towards the departure runway.An air traffic controller cleared the airplane to perform the touch and go landing. The pilot representing N5743A made an abbreviated radio call indicating that he was returning. The controller subsequently saw the accident, made emergency response notifications, and first responders went to the accident site. A liquid consistent with aviation gasoline was found leaking from the left wing, which had partially separated from its fuselage. First responders stopped the fuel leak and subsequently assisted removing the pilot from the airplane as requested by the coroner.The 65-year-old pilot held a FAA commercial pilot certificate with airplane single-engine and multi engine land, instrument airplane, and lighter-than-air free balloon ratings. He also held a flight instructor's certificate for single-engine airplanes. The pilot held a Second Class Medical Certificate dated July 19, 2013, with a limitation to have glasses available for near vision. On the application for that medical certificate, he indicated that he had 2,100 hours of total flight time and 5 hours in last six months as of exam application. The certificate showed that the pilot was 74 inches tall. His logbook showed he had recorded that he flew 1,924.8 hours of total flight timeN5743A was a 1956 model Cessna 172 airplane with serial number 28343. The airplane was a high wing, all-metal, single-engine, four-place monoplane. It had a fixed tricycle landing gear configuration, and was powered by a naturally aspirated, six-cylinder, Continental Motors O-300-B engine, bearing serial number 10976-D-5-B, and marked as producing 145-horsepower at 2,700 rpm. An airplane logbook endorsement showed that the airplane's last annual inspection was completed on May 1, 2014, and that the airplane had a tachometer time of 1,501.14. According to fueling records, the airplane was fueled with 27.1 gallons of aviation gasoline on December 31, 2014.At 1853, the recorded weather at DTN was: Wind 240 at 11 knots; visibility 10 statute miles; sky condition clear; temperature 32 degrees C; dew point 22 degrees C; altimeter 29.94 inches of mercury.DTN, located approximately three miles north of downtown Shreveport, Louisiana, was a towered airport, owned by the Shreveport Airport Authority. The airport's field elevation was 179 feet above mean sea level. DTN had two runways: runway 14/32 - 5,018 feet by 150 feet, asphalt, and runway 5/23 - 3,200 feet by 75 feet, asphalt.The airplane came to rest upright with an approximate 270 degree heading about 840 feet and 214 degrees from the intersection of runway 5/23 and 14/32, near taxiways Mike and Quebec. A ground scar started about 65 feet from and 330 degrees from the wreckage. Red colored glass like media was found abeam the scar about 58 feet from the wreckage. Linear depressions nearly perpendicular to the scar were found about 39 and 38 feet from the wreckage. The linear depressions had a transfer of a media consistent with the black and white color paint on the propeller blades. An oval shape depression was observed along the scar between 37 and 35 feet from the wreckage.The airplane's fuselage was resting with its nose on the ground and its tail elevated. Both wing inboard leading edges sections were not damaged. The left wing tip leading edge had dirt colored media adhering to it. The rear fuselage, aft of the baggage compartment, was torn on its upper surface and the empennage was buckled downward. The empennage structures were not damaged. The left aileron was buckled about mid-span. The left flap was buckled around the inboard hinge. The inboard end of the left flap had a witness mark consistent with contact of the left flap contour formed on the fuselage. The outboard end of the left flap and inboard end of the left aileron had witness marks consistent with contact by each other. The left wing remained attached to the fuselage at its forward spar and had separated from the fuselage at its rear spar. The left fuel tank vent hose was partially separated and the left fuel tank fuel line was separated.The left aileron bell crank was partially separated from its wing mount. The remaining flight controls were intact. The control column in both pitch and roll and the rudder pedals could not be moved due to airframe structure impinging on them. Control cables were traced from the cockpit controls to each flight control surface and flight control continuity was established. The elevator trim wheel moved and its control cables were intact to its trim actuator. The actuator's extension corresponds to zero degrees of trim and the trailing edge of the trim tab was aligned with the elevator's trailing edge. The flap's actuator bar was moved by hand and both flaps moved.The left and right wing tanks were defueled and the removed fuel totaled about 10 gallons. The fuel tank selector valve handle was found out-of-detent between right tank and OFF positions. The fuel line to the engine fuel line was detached and a jumper hose attached. Low-pressure air was applied to the hose and each fuel tank cap was removed to listen for air. The sound of air was heard coming from the right fuel tank filler neck. As the fuel tank selector valve was subsequently rotated thought its four detent positions air was heard in the expected locations; right filler cap opening, left fuel line separation at left wing root, both locations, and then no location. The line was then attached to the detached engine fee line and air again applied. Air was heard at the fuel line detached from the carburetor. Air was applied to the fuel tank vent and it could be heard at both filler necks. The right fuel tank cap's flapper valve was intact.First responders had cut the pilot's seat back off. The pilot's seat rails were buckled. The pilot's seat was pinned in the rail's fifth aft hole. The fifth hole was cracked perpendicular across the hole with respect to the rail. The seat's pin required the use of pliers to retract the pin from the hole.The engine tachometer indicated it had accumulated 1,529.01 hours of time.The propeller had one blade bowed forward and one blade bowed aft. The blade bowed aft had cord-wise abrasions on its blade back. The engine was able to rotate when its propeller flange was turned by hand. The sound of clicking impulse couplings were heard when the flange was turned. The carburetor separated from the engine at its mounting base with the engine. The carburetor accelerator pump ejected a fluid consistent with the smell of aviation gasoline when it was depressed. The engine will be shipped to Continental Motors for further detailed examination.The emergency locator transmitter was found in the on position and was shut off during the examination of the wreckage.The last entries on a Bag Flying Club Logsheet found in the wreckage indicated that the airplane was flown on January 16, 2015 and January 18, 2015, for a duration of .2 hours and 1.2 hours respectively. The logsheet showed that the ending tachometer reading on January 18, 2015, was 1,528.77 hours.A copy of the transcripts of the air traffic control tower communication with N5743A has been requested.The Parish of Caddo Coroner was asked to perform an autopsy on the pilot and to take samples for toxicological testing.",

A crack had proceeded through the top spar flange and had worked its way down to the bottom flange but stopped about 1/4 inch prior to reaching a rivet hole.  The center hinge had broken and a 8.5 inch skin tear was evident on the top surface of the ruddervator.  The ruddervators were properly balanced.  The inspection revealed no maintenance anomalies.  The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive 98-13-02 on July 7, 1998, restricting the airspeed to 144 mph on Beech 35, A35,and B35 airplanes. The aircraft manufacturer issued a Service Bulletin 27-3358 in February 2000, which required an extensive inspection of empennage components, and it changed the ruddervator underbalance from 16.8 to 19.8 inch pounds to 16.8 to 18.0 inch pounds in order to lift the speed restriction.

He landed at an agricultural airstrip, but determined that there was no fuel available there. After departing the agricultural airstrip, he decided to land at a municipal airport in a nearby town, but was unable to locate the runway. He then made the decision to return to his initial departure point without stopping to take on fuel. While on final approach to the initial departure point, the aircraft ran out of fuel, and the pilot was forced to land on a nearby gravel beach. Although the touchdown was uneventful, during the landing roll, the aircraft nosed over on the soft terrain. According to the pilot, he did not keep an accurate tally of his fuel burn and total time airborne, and in considering his fuel situation while en route, he forgot to take into account a one hour and 40 minute  flight on the previous day. It was also determined that the fuel quantity gauges did not accurately reflect the total amount of fuel onboard the aircraft while airborne.",

Multiple origin sites were identified within the bolt hole bore, with corrosion pitting evident at the origin points.  The spar caps met the hardness, chemistry, and microstructure of the production drawing specified material.  Air Tractor Service Letter 118 and the maintenance manual specify an inspection procedure, which calls for the removal of the hopper for a detailed inspection of the spar caps for cracks; one area identified as critical for cracking was the inboard bolt hole bore. The inspection interval was specified as every 2,000 hours or 3 years.

Upon arrival at the field, he performed an aerial survey of his intended landing site checking for wires or obstacles. He also evaluated the weather, which was clear with a calm wind. After landing, he noted that the group of people he was meeting with was on the other side of a ditch about 50 yards away, so he decided to hover-taxi closer to their location. As the helicopter traversed over the ditch, the pilot surveyed the area looking for wires and obstacles. Seeing none, he proceeded to make a turn to land. As the pilot initiated the turn, he saw power lines about 40 feet in front of and above the helicopter. He made a quick right turn to avoid the power lines, \"but made contact with the tail rotor\u2026.\" Not knowing the damage to the tail rotor, he lowered the collective and landed as quickly as possible from an altitude of about 8 feet. The pilot stated that, in his urgency to shut down the helicopter, he \"dropped the collective very fast,\" which he stated caused the main rotor blades to impact the tail boom. The pilot also stated that he got out of his normal routine of performing a pre-landing inspection of his intended landing area when he decided to hover-taxi to an alternate location. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical problems with the helicopter prior to the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain adequate clearance from wires while maneuvering and his subsequent improper use of the collective control, which resulted in the main rotor contacting the tail boom."
