During ground runups, the right engine performed normally. The left engine ran normally, except its auto-ignition & overspeed protection were inoperative due to an open fuse in the Digital Electronic Control Unit (DECU). The open fuse would have prevented an automatic relight after a flameout. The Saab 340 fleet has a history of power losses associated with in-flight icing, dating back to 1985. The manufacturer (Saab) had determined that ice/slush could accumulate on the rear wall of the inlet protective device (bird catcher) & shed from the 'splitter lip' into the engine airflow path. As a preventive measure, Saab had developed an auto-ignition system to provide automatic relighting of the engine. Also, Saab was testing an improved heating system to prevent ice/slush from accumulating on the splitter lip. Title 14 CFR Part 25 requires that airplanes be designed so that engine inlet ice that would adversely affect engine operation cannot accumulate. During flight tests with the left engine inoperative & the propeller synchrophaser engaged, multiple power fluctuations of the right engine occurred.

The airplane was owned and operated by Trinkle Ag Flying, Kingsburg, California. The pilot was not injured. The aerial application flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no FAA flight plan was filed for the flight. The pilot was operating into, and out of, the private airstrip owned by Kenny's Cropdusting, Fresno. The airstrip was equipped with a 1,200-foot-long paved runway, but it was not assigned a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identifier. The terrain to the east side of the north-south runway was about 5 feet lower than the runway, and the two were separated by an embankmentAccording to the pilot, the flight was the third one of the day, and he was applying fertilizer. On touchdown to the north, the pilot heard a \"huge bang,\" and the airplane began to roll right wing down. He tried to correct with aileron but was only partially successful. The airplane decelerated, veered to the right after the right wing contacted the ground, and departed the paved surface. As it began descending the embankment, the propeller struck the ground, and the airplane nosed over. The airplane came to rest inverted, partially down the embankment and mostly off the runway. There was no fire or fertilizer spill. FAA information indicated that the airplane was manufactured in 1972, and was equipped with a Pratt & Whitney R-985 series engine. The airplane had a total time in service of approximately 16,800 hours. Photographs provided by the operator and an FAA inspector revealed that the right main landing gear leg had fractured near the upper bend, just below the fuselage. Preliminary examination of the fracture surfaces revealed characteristics similar to a fatigue fracture. The two sections of the fractured gear leg were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC, for detailed examination and analysis.

The airplane touched down at approximately 182 knots, and about 20 seconds later, at approximately 32 knots, collided with a metal blast fence and an airport perimeter wall. The airplane came to rest on a city street near a gas station off of the airport property. Of the 142 persons on board, 2 passengers sustained serious injuries; 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries; and 94 passengers, 3 flight attendants, and the first officer sustained no injuries. The airplane sustained extensive exterior damage and some internal damage to the passenger cabin. During the accident sequence, the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane; the nose gear collapsed; and the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed. The flight, which was operating on an instrument flight rules flight plan, was conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident, which occurred in twilight lighting conditions. According to Southwest Airlines records, the accident flight was the flight crew's first flight of what was scheduled to be a 3-day flight sequence that consisted of five flights. The accident flight originated at McCarran International Airport (LAS), Las Vegas, Nevada, and was scheduled to depart about 1445 for BUR. The first officer of the accident flight stated to National Transportation Safety Board investigators that he arrived at LAS about 1245, and the captain indicated that he arrived about 1400. The first officer reported in a postaccident interview that he met the captain on the way to the gate. Southwest Airlines records indicate that the accident airplane arrived at LAS from Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California, about 1630, almost 2 hours behind schedule, because of rain and gusting winds in the LAS area. The accident flight crew indicated that the preflight inspection was normal and that no maintenance discrepancies were noted. Flight 1455 departed the gate about 1650, more than 2 hours behind schedule. During postaccident interviews, the flight crew indicated to Safety Board investigators that the takeoff and en route portions of the flight to BUR were normal and uneventful. The first officer stated that after the flight crossed the PMD  very  high  frequency omni-directional radio range (VOR) navigation transmitter at 8,000 feet, he obtained information Oscar from the BUR airport terminal information service (ATIS), which indicated that winds were from 260\u00b0 at 18 knots, gusting to 26 knots, and that aircraft were landing on runways 33 and 26. At 1754:21, the captain stated, \"plan on [runway] three three at the moment. [A]pproach descent checklist when you get the chance.\" At 1802:52, the flight crew was advised by the Southern California terminal radar approach control (SCT) Woodland controller that the current ATIS was information Papa and that they should expect an instrument landing system (ILS) landing on runway 8. At 1803:29, when the airplane was about 20 nautical miles (nm) north of the BUDDE outer marker at an altitude of about 8,000 feet mean sea level (msl), the Woodland controller instructed flight 1455 to turn left to a heading of 190\u00b0 and to descend to and maintain 6,000 feet msl. The first officer acknowledged the instructions. At 1804:02, when the airplane was about 19 nm north of the BUDDE outer marker at an altitude of about 7,800 feet msl, the SCT Woodland controller stated, \"Southwest fourteen fifty five, maintain two thirty or greater `til advised please.\" The captain acknowledged the airspeed adjustment assignment. The Woodland controller indicated in a postaccident interview that he imposed the speed restriction as part of sequencing Southwest flight 1455 between Southwest flight 1713 and Executive Jet flight 278. After the first officer obtained information Papa, he switched back to the approach control frequency. At 1804:42, he informed the captain that the target airspeed for the approach would be 138 knots and, at 1804:49, that winds were \"down to six knots.\" A few seconds later, he confirmed that aircraft were landing at BUR on runway 8. At 1805:08, when the airplane was about 16 nm north of the BUDDE outer marker at an altitude of about 6,000 feet msl, the SCT Woodland controller instructed flight 1455 to \"turn left heading one six zero.\" At 1805:13, the captain indicated to the first officer that ATC \"wants two hundred thirty knots or greater, for a while.\" At 1805:54, the SCT Woodland controller cleared flight 1455 to descend to and maintain 5,000 feet and advised the pilots that they were following company traffic (Southwest Airlines flight 1713) that was at their \"one o'clock and twelve miles [ahead of them] turning onto the final out of forty six hundred.\" The first officer acknowledged the clearance. At 1807:43, the Woodland controller cleared flight 1455 to descend to and maintain 3,000 feet. The first officer acknowledged the clearance. At 1808:18, the first officer notified ATC that he had the Southwest traffic in sight. At 1808:19, the Woodland controller issued an altitude restriction by stating, \"cross Van Nuys at or above three thousand, cleared visual approach runway eight.\" The first officer acknowledged the clearance. At 1808:36, as the airplane was descending through about 3,800 feet msl, the captain began turning to the left for the final approach. In postaccident interviews, the flight crew told investigators that, during the approach, the captain's navigation radio was tuned to the ILS frequency for runway 8, and the first officer's radio was tuned to the Van Nuys VOR. They indicated that the autopilot was engaged in the VOR/LOC mode and that the airplane captured the localizer course but then overshot the centerline before correcting back. The captain stated to investigators that as the flight passed about 2 miles west of Van Nuys at 3,000 feet at approximately 220 to 230 knots, he deployed the speed brakes. According to the CVR, at 1809:28, when the airplane was at an indicated airspeed of about 220 knots, the captain called for \"flaps five.\" At 1809:32, the flaps began to extend. At 1809:43, the captain called for  \"gear down.\" The captain indicated in a postaccident interview that at this point in the flight, he noted a 20-knot tailwind indication on the flight management system (FMS) screen. At 1809:53, the BUR tower controller stated, \"Southwest fourteen fifty five, wind uh...two one zero at six [knots], runway eight, cleared to land.\" Simultaneously, the captain called for \"flaps fifteen.\" At 1810:01, the captain again called for \"flaps...fifteen\" and \"[flaps] twenty five.\" From 1810:24 until 1810:59, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) alerts were being continuously broadcast in the cockpit, first as \"sink rate\" and then, at 1810:44, switching to \"whoop, whoop, pull up.\" At 1810:29, the captain stated, \"flaps thirty, just put it down.\" At 1810:33, the captain stated, \"put it to [flaps] forty. [I]t won't go, I know that. [I]t's all right. [F]inal descent checklist.\" After the GPWS \"whoop, whoop, pull up\" alert sounded at 1810:47, the captain stated, \"that's all right,\" at 1810:53. A final \"sink rate\" warning was recorded at 1810:55. The first officer stated in a postaccident interview that instead of reading the final descent checklist, he visually confirmed the checklist items and remembered seeing the captain arm the ground spoilers. The first officer also stated that when the captain called for flaps 40\u00b0, the airspeed was about 180 knots and went as high as 190 knots during the approach. The first officer indicated that he pointed to his airspeed indicator to alert the captain of the flap limit speed of 158 knots at flaps 40\u00b0. The captain told Safety Board investigators that he remembered hearing the \"sink rate\" warning from the GPWS but that he did not react to the warning because he did not feel that he had to take action. He stated that he did not remember any other GPWS warnings during the approach. The first officer indicated in a postaccident interview that he heard both the \"sink rate\" and the \"pull up\" GPWS warnings but that he believed that the captain was correcting. The first officer also indicated to investigators that he selected the \"Progress\" page on the FMS cockpit display unit but that he could not recall what the wind values were during the approach. He stated to investigators that he was concerned thatthe ground speed was faster than normal but added that he did not verbalize his concern to the captain. The first officer further indicated to investigators that he felt that the approach was stabilized and that they were in a position to land. The captain stated in a postaccident interview that he was aware that Southwest Airlines' standard procedure was for the captain and first officer to call \"1,000 [feet above ground level (agl)], airspeed, and sink rate\" when descending through 1,000 feet. However, no such callouts were recorded by the CVR. The captain also stated in a postaccident interview that he visually perceived that the airplane was \"fast\" as it crossed the approach end of runway 8. CVR and FDR data indicate that the airplane touched down at 1810:58 with flaps extended to 30\u00b0 at about 182 knots; flaps then extended to 40\u00b0 during the ground roll at about 145 knots. The captain stated to Safety Board investigators that after touchdown, the end of the runway appeared to be closer than it should have been and that he thought they might hit the blast fence wall. The captain indicated that he braked \"pretty good\" while attempting to stop the airplane. FDR data indicate that the captain unlocked the thrust reversers 3.86 seconds after touchdown and that the thrust reversers deployed 4.91 seconds after touchdown. The first officer stated to investigators that the captain applied the wheel brakes before the airplane had decelerated to 80 knots and that, as the airplane passed the Southwest Airlines passenger boarding gates, he joined the captain in braking the airplane and applied the brakes as hard as he could. The captain indicated that as the airplane neared the end of the runway, he initiated a right turn using only the nosewheel steering tiller (not the rudder pedals). At 1811:20, the cockpit area microphone (CAM) recorded impact sounds. The airplane departed the right side of the runway about 30\u00b0 from the runway heading, penetrated a metal blast fence and an airport perimeter wall, and came to a stop on a city street off of the airport property. An emergency evacuation ensued, and all crewmembers and passengers successfully exited the airplane. ",
            "probable_cause": "the flight crew's excessive airspeed and flightpath angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller's positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flight crew other than a go-around maneuver."

The crew of the Boeing 767 shut down the APU and began coordinating with dispatch for a return to the gate. The crew was then directed by the tower to hold their position and to shut down their engines. Soon thereafter, the tower advised the crew that the Fire Marshall had called for the aircraft to be evacuated because there was still smoke coming from the APU exhaust. The aircraft was evacuated using the evacuation slides at the door exits. One passenger received serious injuries during the evacuation. An inspection of the APU showed that the fuel control unit and the gearbox shutoff valve needed to be replaced. Once those units were replaced, the APU was test run with no further discrepancies noted. ",

The stain became small beads of pooling liquid at the low point of the belly, indicating a hydraulic leak. Above the stain, on the right side of the engine firewall, were two hydraulic fittings where hoses connected to either side of the nose landing gear actuator.

            "narrative": ": NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this public aircraft accident report.The aircraft collided with ground obstructions and nosed over during a night forced landing on a dirt road following a catastrophic engine failure during cruise.  A large hole was found in the engine case on each side of the upper spine between the numbers 1 and 2 cylinders.  FAA AD 99-09-17 was issued on April 22, 1999, and mandated compliance with Continental Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) 99-3, which required visual and ultrasonic inspections of the crankshaft for cracks; these inspections had to be done by Continental factory service representatives.  The inspection was performed on May 4, 1999, 220 hours prior to the accident. To perform the inspection, cylinders 1 and 3, and all 4 counterweights on the crankshaft had to be removed.  This engine's crankshaft has 4 counterweights, which are installed on hangar blades extending out on each side of the Nos. 2 and 5 crank cheeks (CC).  The weights are retained on the blades by pins, which are held in the bores by pin retaining plates on each side of the weight.  These plates are slightly elliptical on one edge of the circumference, which forms an ear that results in an interference fit within the bores of each weight.  The plates are held in place by snap rings that fit into separate grooves machined into the weight bores.  Three versions of MSB 99-3 were eventually issued.  99-3A was issued on April 22, 1999, and was current when the compliance inspection was performed.  Versions 99-3B and 99-3C were issued on July 6 and 27, 1999, respectively, and superceded 99-3A and each other in sequential order.  An additional Service Bulletin, SB 00-3, was issued on February 2, 2000 (13 days prior to the accident and 9 months after the crankshaft inspection was performed), and provided detailed and specific procedures for the reinstallation of crankshaft counterweights, including the correct orientation and installation of the counterweight pins, retainer plates, and snap rings.  The principal difference between MSB 99-3A, and versions 99-3B and 99-3C, is that versions B and C incorporate the guidance on counterweight pin retainer plate and snap ring installation found in SB 00-3.  Versions 99-3B and 99-3C specifically emphasize a dimensional measurement between snap ring ears as a means to determine that they are fully seated in their grooves.    SB 00-3 and versions B and C of SB 99-3 specify that the pin retainer plates and snap rings must be installed in specific orientations within the weight bores.  Review of the precursor service bulletins to SB 00-3 disclosed that it was the first one to detail and emphasize the criticality of the retainer plate and snap ring orientations within the bores, and provide a measurement between the snap ring ears when the ring is fully seated within the weight bore.  The engine overhaul manual does not go into specific detail regarding the orientation of the pin retainer plates and snap rings, nor does it provide a measurement of the snap ring ears to verify full seating of the ring.  All other references that would have been available to the mechanic at the time of the inspection did not address the criticality of the correct counterweight retainer plate and snap ring installation.    During the inspection process on May 4, 1999, the operator's mechanic prepared the engine by removing cylinders 1 and 3 and the associated connecting rods.  When the factory representative arrived to perform the visual and ultrasonic inspections of CC2 and CC5, the mechanic removed the counterweights.  Following the inspection, the mechanic reinstalled the weights, connecting rods, and cylinders.  The mechanic would have had to perform all the work through the 5.5-inch cylinder base openings in the crankcase, and the weight bores, including the positions of the retaining plate snap rings, would have been perpendicular to the opening.  According to the mechanic who performed the job, the work was inspected by a company inspector at each stage and signed off on the work order.    The oil pan was removed from the engine and the sump contents were in part identified as follows:  1. A crankshaft counterweight (in pieces) identified as having been mounted on crank cheek 2 as the leading weight. 2. 2 Crankshaft counterweight pins.  By part number, one pin was for the No. 2 leading weight and one was from the No. 3 trailing weight. 3. 4 Counterweight pin retaining plates 4. 5 counterweight retaining plate snap rings  Of the four recovered counterweight pin retaining plates from the oil sump pan, two were bent and distorted and two were not damaged or distorted.  For the recovered pin retaining plate snap rings, three were distorted and two were not; the undistorted snap rings were of the correct diameter.  During disassembly of the engine, the condition of the three remaining counterweight assemblies were documented as follows: The No. 1 trailing weight on crank cheek 2 remained attached to the blade, with the pin retainer plates and snap rings correctly installed.  The No. 3 trailing weight on crank cheek 5 was partially retained on the hangar blade by only the forward pin.  The aft pin, and, the retainer plate and snap ring from one side of the weight were missing; these parts were found in the oil sump.  The forward pin was in place and retained by its associated retainer plates and snap rings.  One snap ring was installed correctly and one was not.  The No. 4 leading weight on crank cheek 5 remained on its hangar blade.  All snap rings and retainer plates were intact and installed correctly.  Examination of the engine found no evidence of oil starvation or exhaustion, or any other internal anomaly beyond the separation of the No. 2 leading counterweight that would have led to the catastrophic destruction of the engine. ",
            "probable_cause": "The company mechanic's failure to correctly install one or more of the crankshaft counterweight pin retaining plate snap rings, specifically ensuring that the snap rings were fully seated in their grooves.  This led to the complete separation of the No. 2 leading counterweight and the partial separation of the No. 3 trailing weight from the crankshaft and a resulting internal catastrophic engine failure.  A factor in the accident was the lack of definitive procedural guidance in any of the engine manufacturer's reference material, available at the time, on the correct installation of these components.

            "probable_cause": "The failure of the number 5 engine bearing assembly followed by the disconnection of the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and the melting of the NL probe port (sealing tube) which allowed an oil fed fire beyond the constraints of the engine casing and into the engine nacelle.  A contributing factor was the company's failure to follow several maintenance procedures within the maintenance manual after a previous oil loss event.  A second factor was the omission of the PW120A engine from the airworthiness directive issued by the FAA which mandated the completion of Pratt & Whitney service bulletin 20914.  The lack of inclusion of the PW120A engine in the AD resulted in the company\u2019s correct interpretation that the service bulletin was not mandatory."

The flight instructor unsuccessfully attempted to restore engine power, and the pilots chose to conduct an off-airport landing to a field, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and wings.\u000b\u000bFollowing the accident, one of the airplane\u2019s owners inspected the airplane before the wreckage recovery.

He reported that the throttle linkage was found in the full-forward position and that the throttle body arm was found in the low-power setting. He asked an individual to move the throttle control in the cockpit and noted that the throttle linkage moved but that the throttle body arm did not move. A postaccident test run of the engine was performed following the replacement of the bolt that connected the throttle cable to the throttle control arm, and no anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation.\u000b\u000bReview of maintenance logbook records revealed that the most recent annual inspection was completed on April 15, 2013, at a recorded tachometer reading of 5,276.8 hours.

During the maintenance, the starter was removed, overhauled, and reinstalled on the engine, and no maintenance was conducted in the area of the throttle linkage and throttle body arm. It is likely that, during maintenance at a previous undetermined time, the cotter pin was removed from the throttle linkage bolt and nut and not reinstalled.

Flying over the location, he realized that they had not yet arrived, so he decided to land at an alternate location and await their arrival. He had landed at the alternate location previously but not on the day of the accident. He said the visibility was good, but there were no shadows due to the overcast. The approach was normal, and the pilot used a small pine tree to the right front quarter of the helicopter as a reference point. As the helicopter touched down, the pilot heard a loud noise and the helicopter yawed. Believing there had been a mechanical failure, the pilot lowered the collective control and closed the throttle. Postaccident inspection revealed there had not been a mechanical failure. Rather, the pilot had not seen the snow covered slope to the left front quarter of the helicopter. The main rotor blades struck the surface of the ground and the helicopter settled into deep snow. The transmission separated from its mounts, the main rotor blades were destroyed, and the tail boom was severed.",

The pilot received radar vectors to fly direct to the nearest airport. Shortly thereafter, the pilot advised the air traffic controller that he was unable to reach the airport and was going to land in a field. According to a witness adjacent the field, the airplane flew at a low altitude over his home, and it made a sharp, banking turn in an attempt to land in the field. The airplane was unable to land in the clearing and collided with a tree line at the end of a field, and a postcrash fire ensued.

The No. 2 crankshaft journal was visible through the crankcase fracture, and no connecting rod was observed on the journal. Further examination of the No. 2 cylinder rod cap and the related bolt pieces revealed that the rod cap was fractured. Examination revealed that the bearing shells for the No. 3 and No. 4 cylinders displayed severe abrasive wear on the bearing surfaces. It is likely that due to the failure of the No. 2 rod end cap bolt, the rod end cap came loose, which resulted in a fracture of the case halves and subsequent loss of engine oil.

However, the airplane did not climb out of ground effect, and it settled into a bean field. He stated that there were no mechanical issues with the airplane during the accident takeoff. The pilot had reduced the chemical load for the agricultural application flight due to the runway length and ambient temperature, and he had elected to conduct the accident takeoff with the wing flaps extended to about 25 degrees. He reported a gross weight for the accident takeoff of 10,100 lbs. Performance data indicated that a takeoff distance of about 2,600 feet was required to clear a 50-foot obstacle. However, that data was applicable to a hard surface runway at a maximum certificated gross takeoff weight of 8,000 lbs with 10 degrees of flaps. The airplane flight manual did not contain takeoff data for weights or flap settings in excess of 8,000 lbs and 10 degrees, respectively. The airplane manufacturer recommended that takeoffs not be attempted with more than 10 degrees of flap. Regulations and guidance related to agricultural application flights in restricted category airplanes allowed for operations up to 31 percent above the certificated gross takeoff weight. The pilot reported that the maximum gross weight for the airplane was 10,480 lbs, which corresponded to the 31 percent limit. FAA guidance suggested that an increase in takeoff gross weight of 31 percent will increase the required takeoff distance by about 90 percent. The reduced acceleration due to the rough, turf runway and the excess flap deflection selected by the pilot, combined with operating near the maximum permitted takeoff gross weight, resulted in the airplane's inability to attain a positive rate of climb after liftoff.",

First responders to the accident site, which included sheriff's air unit mechanics, found the engine running at idle and a fire in the engine compartment.  The helicopter had just come out of a scheduled 100/300-hour inspection and this was the first mission flight since the maintenance.  During the inspection, the engine's fuel control Hydromechanical Unit (HMU) had been removed for compliance with a service bulletin.  Prior to this flight, the helicopter had completed a 10-minute post maintenance flight check.  The pilot in command (PIC) conducted the preflight inspection.  The mission observer flight officer, who held a private pilot certificate with helicopter rating and was attempting to upgrade to a pilot position, had been given permission to fly the helicopter and installed the dual flight controls to the right side.  No problems were noted during the preflight, and the takeoff was normal.  About 500 feet above ground level during the transition from climb out to cruise, the pilot flying heard the LOW ROTOR voice warning (two times) followed by ENGINE OUT voice warning (two times).  Without initiating an autorotation, he requested that the PIC take the flight controls.  Simultaneously, the PIC had sensed a problem and took the flight controls.  Prior to and during the departure up until the engine deceleration, the PIC performed the observer flight officer duties, which included radio communications with dispatch, and had not monitored the flight instrument readings or the progress of the departure.  The LOW ROTOR voice warning activates when Nr falls below 95 percent.  The voice warning system for ENGINE OUT activates when N1 falls below 55 percent or a high rate of decay in N1.  No discrepancies were noted during the inspection of the airframe.  A teardown of the engine disclosed no internal discrepancies; however, the fuel inlet line fitting to the engine HMU was found loose by two flats of the nut.  Functional testing of the fire damage ECU (electronic control unit) found no discrepancies.  The HMU was installed in a test bench and passed a functional check.  The fuel line inlet fitting nut was then loosened incrementally one flat at a time with a functional test conducted each time.  Significant fluctuations in metered fuel output flow were noted during one test with the nut three flats loose, and again at one complete turn loose.  These results could not be reliably duplicated in subsequent tests.  The investigation found that the operator had not established guidance for crew resource management pertaining to crew responsibilities, instrument monitoring responsibilities, emergency procedures initiation, or flight control transfer procedures when flying in a dual pilot operation.",

Also causal was the flying pilot's and pilot-in-command's delayed recognition of the power loss, as well as, the flying pilot's failure to initiate an autorotation in a timely manner.  The pilot-in-command's failure to regain and maintain adequate main rotor rpm was also causal.

The airplane was owned by Warden Air, LLC, Warden, Washington, and operated by the pilot as an instrument flight rules (IFR) personal cross-country flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The airplane departed in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, and the pilot had not received the IFR clearance. The private pilot and the three passengers were not injured. The airplane was bound for Klamath Falls, Oregon. The pilot reported that during the power up for takeoff, the left engine revolutions per minute (RPM) was 2,200 while the right engine was 2,600 RPM. He leaned the mixture on the left engine to bring the RPM up to 2,600 and proceeded with the takeoff. After the takeoff roll he initiated a climb and noted that the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) on the left engine was much higher than the EGT of the right engine. The left engine RPM dropped suddenly to 2,000 RPM and the airplane yawed to the left and started to descend. He was unable to overcome the yaw and descent, and the airplane impacted the ground. The investigation into the loss of engine power is pending an examination of the left engine.",

The pilot reported that he put the gear handle in the down position as he was crossing over the field to enter the downwind leg of the traffic pattern for runway 20.  At this time he noticed that the green landing gear annunciator light had illuminated.  Due to the high level of traffic in the pattern, the pilot did not look into the mirrors to visually check if the landing gear had deployed successfully like he usually does.  During the landing flare, the airplane's tail impacted the runway causing the airplane to bounce.  The tail came down and impacted the runway again.  Shortly thereafter, the entire airplane spun off the runway to the left onto the grass separating the taxiway and the runway.   A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the airplane after the accident occurred.  He stated that the main landing gear doors were closed, and the main gear was in the fully retracted position.  The nose wheel had partially extended.  The FAA inspector interviewed several witnesses who heard the airplane's engine increase in power just prior to the landing.  According to the Cessna 210 Owners Manual, the landing gear and doors operate in a specific sequence.  Once the pilot places the gear position handle out of the neutral position, the engine driven hydraulic pump begins to create hydraulic pressure and transfers it to the hydraulic actuators, which operate the landing gear doors and landing gear.  When the gear position handle is placed in the down position, the hydraulic pump supplies pressure to the door's actuators first, allowing the doors to open.  Then, the hydraulic pressure will switch to the landing gear actuators, and the gear will extend.  Once the landing gear has completed the extension, the hydraulic pressure will switch back to the door's actuators, and the doors will close.  When the doors have completely closed, the gear position handle will return to the neutral position, completing the process.",

According to Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control records, multiple one-leg flight plans were filed for the flight. Based on this information, the estimated fuel endurance was 3 hours 20 minutes.The pilot receiving instruction stated that the fuel selector was in the \u201cboth\u201d position throughout the flight but that, on final approach, he noticed that the fuel selector had been switched to the \u201cright\u201d tank position, so he moved the fuel selector back to the \u201cboth\u201d position. Shortly thereafter, the engine stopped producing power. The flight instructor stated that the pilot inadvertently selected the \u201coff\u201d position instead of the \u201cboth\u201d position when he moved the fuel selector from the \u201cright\u201d tank position.During the subsequent forced landing, the airplane\u2019s cabin and fuselage were damaged, but both wing fuel tanks remained intact.

The engine started immediately, accelerated smoothly, and ran continuously with no anomalies observed. According to the airplane manufacturer, the airplane\u2019s fuel tanks had a total capacity of 43 gallons, of which 3 gallons were unusable.

The private pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the local personal flight that was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to initial information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the all-metal, \"Y-tail,\" two-seat monoplane was built by the pilot from a kit that was purchased during September 2010, and issued an FAA special airworthiness certificate on January 15, 2013. The airplane was equipped with an 80-horsepower 2180 AeroVee engine, and had been based at XFL for about 6 months.According to FAA radar data, the airplane departed XFL about 0925, and flew to the northeast.

The captain maintained the airplane's airspeed below 215 knots, and initiated a return to the departure airport.  The flight crew took turns at the controls.  To maintain the airplane in the proper attitude, the first officer had to maintain about 30 pounds of backpressure on the yolk to counteract the trim forces.  The captain landed the airplane uneventfully.  Maintenance crews believed the failure was in the captain's stab trim disconnect switch, which they suspected was stuck in the cutout position.  The switch was replaced with another unit.  A second stab trim failure event occurred 32 days later in the same airplane.  The captain reported that during a descent from flight level 290, both channels of stab trim and mach trim failed with a corresponding \"AP Pitch Trim\" message.  After about 2 minutes, the captain was able to reset both stab trim channels and then the mach trim.  The airplane landed uneventfully.  The maintenance crew removed and replaced the Horizontal Stabilizer Trim Control Unit (HSTCU) to correct the discrepancy.  The airplane's flight data recorders (FDR's) were removed, and the data downloaded.  The data revealed that 17 minutes into the flight on the first occurrence the stabilizer trim discrete changed from 'on' to 'off.'  The data for the second occurrence revealed that 96 minutes into the flight the stabilizer trim discrete changed from 'on' to 'off' for about 2 minutes, and then back to 'on.'  The stab trim disconnect switch and the HSTCU were tested, and both functioned within the manufacturer's specifications.  Under physical examination it was noted that the HSTCU's access panel door cam-type fastener's shoulder guide was missing from one of the two door latching fittings.  The shoulder half was located loose inside the HSTCU circuitry area of the unit.  Engineers described the electrical circuit boards as having a heavy coat of protective/sealing varnish that would protect the circuits from shorts caused by debris.  Additionally, each trim channel is on a separate circuit board in the HSTCU.  The simultaneous failure of both trim channels due to a single piece of debris is unlikely.  A search of the Federal Aviation Administration Service Difficulty Report (SDR) database for Stab Control System anomalies in the CL-600 from 1995 to July 10, 2003, identified 67 dual channel stab trim failures.  Twenty-seven percent of the dual trim failures were identified as cockpit trim disconnect switch issues; 52 percent were identified as HSTCU/HSTA/MCU issues; and 21percent were not resolved or could not be duplicated on the ground.

After performing maneuvers in the practice area, the flight instructor and student proceeded to a nearby airport to practice touch-and-goes.  As they approached the airport traffic pattern, the student pilot moved the gear selector to the down position.  Once the gear was down they noticed that the left main gear down light was not illuminated.  They recycled the landing gear, but still received the same indication.  A low approach and flyby past the tower confirmed that the gear was in the down position.  The instructor decided to return to his home airport instead of landing at this airport.  While en route, the instructor and student inspected the light bulbs of the indicator light and found them to be operating properly.  They recycled the gear one more time.  While doing this, the gear motor circuit breaker popped, and they smelled smoke in the cockpit.  They pulled the landing gear circuit breakers immediately and the smoke smell cleared.  The pilots extended the landing gear using the manual extension checklist.  Once the gear came down, they still had the same unsafe gear indication.  The instructor yawed the airplane in an attempt to lock the gear, but received the same unsafe indication.  Upon arriving at his home airport, the instructor touched down using a soft-field landing technique.  As the airplane decelerated, the left main landing gear collapsed and the left wing tip and the propeller struck the runway.  Federal Aviation Administration inspectors examined the main landing gear after the accident.  They found the left main landing gear \"A\" frame tube had failed.  Airworthiness Directive 97-06-10 requires repetitive inspection of the main landing gear \"A\" frame assemblies for cracks and lubrication, and requires the replacement of any assembly found cracked.  The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent main landing gear failure and collapse because of a cracked \"A\" frame assembly.  A review of the aircraft records indicated that AD 97-06-10 had been complied with during the last 100-hour inspection on June 21, 2006.  This aircraft is operated by a flight school and the maintenance records show that it is operated at an activity level where a 100-hour inspection is accomplished once every 30 days or so.",
