The private pilot sustained minor injuries, while his pilot-rated passenger was seriously injured. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which originated from GA2 about 1020. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.The pilot was interviewed by telephone and provided a written statement. He said the purpose of the flight was to familiarize the passenger with the operation of the airplane. According to the pilot, the preflight inspection, engine start, warm-up, taxi, and takeoff were conducted with no anomalies noted. He briefed the passenger that he would depart from runway 31, perform some turns, and return over the airport in order to enter a right downwind for landing on runway 13. The airplane's engine power and performance were \"good\" and the airplane demonstrated its \"gentle\" handling characteristics through both left and right 30-degree bank turns. The pilot said he crossed the airport about traffic pattern altitude, and then remembered being in a vertical, nose-down descent. He said he had no recollection of how the airplane transitioned from level flight to descending nose down.The pilot stated that he held the control stick fully aft during the descent, and that the elevator gained enough authority to level the airplane just above ground level, as he flew between a parked airplane and the airport restaurant. The airplane then collided with a flagpole, the restaurant, and terrain before coming to rest upright. The pilot said that once the airspeed increased sufficiently during the descent, he had full flight control authority.Photographs of the wreckage by a local media outlet revealed that the entire tube and fabric structure of the airplane was completely destroyed. A flag and flagpole were seen entangled with the wreckage. The engine and propeller were not visible.According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 1945. Its most recent annual inspection was completed October 3, 2014, at 1,749 total aircraft hours. The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land. His most recent FAA third class medical certificate was issued in April 8, 2014. The pilot reported 1,400 total hours of flight experience, of which 305 were in the accident airplane make and model.The pilot reported that there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.",

Investigators noted that both wings and the associated main spars showed deformation about the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical axes of the wing with multiple \"S\" bends and twists in the main spars.  The main wing aft attach points remained secured to the fuselage in the normal manner.  The tail section remained attached to the fuselage, with damage consistent with impact forces.

The engine, however, continued to run rough and began to \u201ccough\u201d like it was starved of fuel, so the pilot made sure that both fuel valves were open, and turned on the electric fuel boost pump. The pilot then assessed that the engine might stop running, so he called for the high altitude engine failure checklist. However, before he and the other crewmember began the checklist, the propeller came off the airplane, struck the right side of the cowling, struck the right lift strut, and fell away. The pilot then declared an emergency with air traffic control, began evaluating landing sites, and elected to ditch in a nearby lake. \u000b\u000bExamination of the wreckage revealed that the entire propeller assembly, including the propeller spinner and propeller flange extension, had separated from the propeller flange, which was part of the forward portion of the engine crankshaft. Examination of the engine revealed that the bolts that held the propeller flange extension onto the engine crankshaft had sheared off and that the No. 6 cylinder exhaust valve and valve seat were missing from their installed positions. Further examination revealed that the exhaust valve head had come to rest in the oil pan, and parts of the exhaust valve seat had been captured in the muffler.\u000b\u000bExamination of the No. 6 cylinder exhaust valve revealed that the valve stem had fractured near the transition from the head radius to the cylindrical stem and that lead deposits were on the stem next to the fracture. Multiple ratchet marks were present around the perimeter of the stem. The presence of the ratchet marks and the fracture surface were consistent with fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Examination of the other cylinders and pistons also revealed the presence of heavy lead deposits, which can act as an insulating layer and can interfere with the normal heat transfer process; such deposits indicate that the engine may have been run at some point at excessively high temperatures. \u000b\u000bAccording to the engine manufacturer, they were aware of about eight previous in-service failures of exhaust valves. They advised that the exhaust valves appeared to be intolerant of temperatures over about 750 degrees C and that heat stress was the most common issue that they had identified. They further advised that around that temperature, the exhaust valve would start showing indications of stress corrosion/cracking at the base of the stem.\u000b\u000bExamination of the crankshaft revealed that it had six evenly spaced threaded holes and three smooth bored holes. Each threaded hole contained the shank of a capscrew that had fractured flush with the face of the forward end of the crankshaft. The three smoothed-bored holes showed no evidence of them containing anything that had been inserted or installed in the bore. The fracture faces on the capscrews had a smooth appearance with smear marks orientated in the direction of rotation, which are  consistent with an overstress fracture in shear.\u000b\u000bAccording to the manufacturer, at the time of the accident, they had identified about 8 instances where the propeller flange attachment had separated from airplanes due to varying circumstances. To alleviate some of the problems that they observed, they took several steps ensure that a flange would be properly installed. These steps included issuing two service bulletins and changes to the configuration of new engines to have the longer flange as standard. They also altered the maintenance requirements of the engine for more detailed monitoring of the propeller flange area, and altered the design of the engine to incorporate three 8mm dowels between the crankshaft and the propeller flange; in July 2011, they began including these propeller flange dowels into the engines.\u000b\u000bComparison of the engine\u2019s propeller flange to other propeller flanges indicated that the propeller flange diameter of the engine was markedly smaller than others that were in service. Since torque is the product of force and distance, and the distance of each of each capscrew from the center of the flange was small, the torque on each capscrew was very high. Furthermore, since the capscrews were fully threaded along their length, they had no bearing portion for shear loads, and the threaded portions had stress raisers in the form of a radius at the root. \u000b\u000bFAA documentation also indicated that assembly and maintenance errors have contributed to hazardous or catastrophic conditions with propeller assemblies. No indication however of the propeller flange design being designed to mitigate the effects of maintenance errors was discovered, though the propeller and propeller flange were required to go through frequent maintenance. Examination of the propeller flange design also did not indicate that it was designed to facilitate maintenance and correct reassembly or if the incorrect assembly of parts could result in hazardous propeller effects, or if the parts were designed to minimize the risk of incorrect assembly. Review of the experimental amateur built rules promulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration and the light sport aircraft consensus standards also did not reveal any guidance regarding design precautions to minimize the hazards that could occur to an airplane if a propeller blade failed or was released by a hub failure, requirements of a safety analysis to ensure that the risk to the aircraft from propeller failure conditions was within an acceptable range, or whether parts were required to be designed to minimize the risk of incorrect assembly.\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "A failure of an engine cylinder exhaust valve due to the buildup of lead deposits on the valve stem and fatigue cracking of the valve stem, resulting in a total loss of engine power, and the loss of the propeller.

The crew had checked the NOTAMS for the flight and discussed one, which cautioned pilots to be aware of a ditch that was not easily visible nor marked, which was located directly across from the new terminal.  The crew discussed the ditch during preflight and also on their earlier arrival into the airport; however, the crew did not see the ditch. The crew taxied across the ramp to a hold point and called ground control for a taxi clearance.  Initial taxi clearance had the airplane turning right on the closest parallel taxiway.  Due to weight considerations, the crew requested a runway change.  Ground control then had the airplane turn right on the outboard parallel taxiway.  The captain said he looked down at the taxiway diagram and confused his position with taxiway C4 rather than Spot 4.  The captain then taxied the airplane forward across taxiway C, through the ditch, and made a right turn onto taxiway Bravo.  After encountering the ditch, the crew came to a consensus that there was nothing unusual about the airplane to preclude continuing the flight.  The flight attendants did not convey to the flight crew the extent of motion in the back of the airplane, nor did the flight crew ask the flight attendants about their ride in the back of the airplane.  The flight to their intended destination was uneventful.  The oncoming crew discovered the minor damage to the airplane.  At the time of the incident, the infield area was not lit or marked to help illuminate the ditch, and the ditch had no boundary hazard markings.  One month prior to this event, another air carrier had one of their airplanes taxi through the same area.  After the two incidents, airport operations ordered and placed plastic reflective delineators around the ditch area. ",

The pilot did not file a flight plan, and had no communication with any air traffic control facility during the flight.While en route, witnesses saw the airplane fly slowly across a valley near the entrance of a national park, which was not the intended route of flight. The airplane suddenly pitched up, stalled, and dived into wooded terrain within the park. Two pilot-rated witnesses said the engines were operating at the time of the accident, and the landing gear was retracted.An on-scene examination of the burned airplane structure and engines revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical deficiencies, or any evidence that the cargo had shifted during the flight. A former military pilot who had experience in the accident type airplane, stated that the airplane was considered unrecoverable from a stall, and for that reason, pilots did not typically practice stalls in it. He also indicated that if a problem was encountered with one of the two piston engines on the airplane, the auxiliary jet engine on the affected side should be started to provide additional thrust.  Given the lack of mechanical deficiencies discovered during postaccident inspection, the absence of any distress communications, and the fact that neither of the two auxiliary jet engines had been started to assist in the event of a piston engine malfunction, it is likely the pilot allowed the airplane to lose airspeed and enter a low altitude stall from which he was unable to recover.",

Witnesses observed the helicopter descend vertically with the rotors visibly slowing down, nose over to an inverted position, impact the ground inverted, and roll onto its left side.   Initial examination of the engine revealed that when the power turbine was rotated, the engine output adapter attached to the reduction gearbox did not rotate, indicating a mechanical disconnect within the engine.  Disassembly of the engine revealed severe damage to the sun gear shaft, which coupled the power turbine to the reduction gear box.  Further disassembly and materials analysis disclosed an assembly error of one of the three aft planetary gear shaft roller bearings in the reduction gear box and improper crimping of the lockcup on the N1 seal and nut assembly.  These two errors resulted in misalignment in the planetary gear train leading to high tooth loading in the sun gear shaft, which resulted in stripping and separation of gear teeth and loss of transmitted torque through the reduction gear box.  Examination of maintenance records indicated that the bearing assembly error occurred during an overhaul of the reduction gear box by a certified repair station 822.8 operating hours before the accident.

About 45 minutes after departure, on what was reported as a dark night, the pilot encountered an area of precipitation; radar data indicates that he then initiated a left turn and reversed his course. Shortly after rolling out of that turn, the airplane entered a steep left turn and descended into the terrain, most likely due to the pilot\u2019s spatial disorientation. Infrared satellite imagery revealed that the area around the accident site was under a solid cloud cover, and the cloud tops in the area around the time of the accident were about 21,000 feet. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control due to spatial disorientation while executing a turn to reverse his course in dark night and low-visibility conditions. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to initiate the flight into an area of known low visibility."

It impacted a golf course less than a mile from the airport. The duration of the accident flight was about 2 minutes.

The appearance of the debris was similar to the fiberglass material used in the construction of the airframe. The fuel tanks had been repaired shortly before the accident due to damage related to the use of alcohol-containing fuel (ethanol). The engine fuel line did not contain any fuel and the carburetors contained only a minimal amount of fuel. Although the finding of minimal fuel at the engine was consistent with fuel starvation, a definitive reason for a starvation event could not be determined. According to a carburetor icing probability chart, an airplane operating in the ambient conditions at the time of the accident could expect a serious risk of carburetor icing while at cruise and glide power. Engine operations at low power during ground operations are similar to that of operations at glide power, making the carburetor susceptible to icing prior to takeoff; however,  a conclusive determination related to the presence of carburetor icing was not possible.

The recorded route of flight of the eastbound target continued up to the last radar return at 1832:31, at a Mode C altitude of 8,300 feet mean sea level (msl) (7,000 feet above ground level (agl)).

About 1821, an unidentified aircraft called the Unicom operator and the pilot asked about the weather.  The operator provided the weather from the Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) monitor screen, and asked the pilot where the aircraft was coming from.

The flight included low altitude maneuvers, to include low altitude flights into canyons. Photographs provided by the passenger revealed that the airplane was flown at low altitude through the canyons, and very close to the canyon walls. The pilot then landed and disembarked the passenger. Shortly thereafter, the pilot departed with another passenger onboard in the direction of the accident site. Witnesses observed the airplane flying low within a canyon shortly before a power failure occurred in the local town. Damage to the airplane revealed that the left wing struck the power transmission lines. The witness statements, damage sustained by the wing, and the position of the airplane after the accident, indicated that the pilot most likely turned left into an adjacent canyon from the one he was in and immediately into the path of the power lines.",

When the pilot turned the heater off, dark smoke entered the cabin and obscured the occupants' vision. The smoke likely interfered with the pilot\u2019s ability to identify a safe landing site. During the subsequent emergency landing attempt to a field, the airplane\u2019s wing contacted the ground and the airplane cartwheeled. Examination of the airplane found several leaks around weld points on the combustion chamber of the heater unit. A review of logbook entries revealed that the heater was documented as inoperative during the most recent annual inspection. Although a work order indicated that maintenance work was completed at a later date, there was no logbook entry that returned the heater to service. There were no entries in the maintenance logbooks that documented any testing of the heater or tracking of the heater's hours of operation. A flight instructor who flew with the pilot previously stated that the pilot used the heater on the accident airplane at least once before the accident flight. The heater\u2019s overheat warning light activated during that flight, and the heater shut down without incident. The flight instructor showed the pilot how to reset the overheat circuit breaker but did not follow up on its status during their instruction. There is no evidence that a mechanic examined the airplane before the accident flight. Regarding the overheat warning light, the airplane flight manual states that the heater \u201cshould be thoroughly checked to determine the reason for the malfunction\u201d before the overheat switch is reset. The pilot\u2019s use of the heater on the accident flight suggests that he did not understand its status and risk of its continued use without verifying that it had been thoroughly checked as outlined in the airplane flight manual. A review of applicable airworthiness directives found that, in comparison with similar combustion heater units, there is no calendar time limit that would require periodic inspection of the accident unit. In addition, there is no guidance or instruction to disable the heater such that it could no longer be activated in the airplane if the heater was not airworthy.",
            "probable_cause": "The malfunction of the cabin heater, which resulted in an inflight fire and smoke in the airplane. Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s lack of understanding concerning the status of the airplane's heater system following and earlier overheat event and risk of its continued use. Also contributing were the inadequate inspection criteria for the cabin heater."

Immediately after takeoff,  the pilot reported a sudden drop of the right wing when the aircraft cleared the tree line surrounding the airstrip.

About 45 minutes into the flight, the left engine started to sputter.  The pilot attempted to restart the engine.  When the engine did not restart, he secured it and then flew towards an alternate airport.  Prior to reaching the airport, he attempted to lower the landing gear by placing the landing gear handle in the DOWN position.  The landing gear did not extend, so he tried to lower the landing gear via the primary emergency landing gear system (hand pump).  When that did not work, he activated the secondary emergency extension system (CO2 blow down tank) by pulling the emergency gear extension ring.  The CO2 tank discharged; however, only the right main landing gear extended.

A flight attendant, who was servicing the aft cabin, sustained leg and ankle fractures when her service cart became airborne and struck her in the leg. Both the flight and cabin crew members stated that the turbulence was unexpected. The National Weather Service (NWS) had issued multiple, sequential warnings of significant meteorological activity (SIGMETs) regarding the potential for thunderstorms and turbulence along the flight's planned route. The operator's dispatch department provided the flightcrew with a SIGMET that was valid until about one hour before the scheduled departure time. Contrary to operator and regulatory requirements, the dispatch department did not provide the flight crew with updated, current information, which included two new SIGMETs, one of which was issued an hour before the scheduled departure time, and all of which were similar in content and coverage area. The flight crew did not check with dispatch to determine whether any SIGMETS were current for the planned departure time. None of the air traffic controllers who handled the flight prior to the event relayed any hazardous weather information to the flight, despite their requirement to do so. Correlation of meteorological and flight path data indicated that the turbulence encounter occurred when the airplane penetrated a continuous line of thunderstorms that was present in the SIGMET coverage area. Strong radar echoes, indicative of potential turbulence, were detected below the airplane's altitude by ground-based weather radar. Review of the operator's flight and cabin crew guidance revealed that the procedures incorporated some of the latest industry strategies for mitigating turbulence hazards, but did not provide the flight attendants with the recommended level of autonomy when it came to decisions about when to provide service, or how to prioritize tasks, in the event of turbulence. Although hindered by the failure of the dispatch department to provide them with current SIGMETs, given the previous SIGMET and forecast for significant thunderstorms along the route, and atmospheric activity that was likely readily detectable by the airplane's onboard weather radar, the flightcrew could have anticipated the turbulence, and the flight attendants could have either been instructed to remain seated, or been provided with sufficient information to decide on their own, until the airplane was clear of the hazard area.",

About 6 minutes later, radar and radio contact were lost. No distress calls from the pilot were reported. A witness who was working near the accident site reported hearing a very loud revving engine noise. When he looked up, he saw the airplane flying upside down. He also stated that he did not see a cockpit or a pilot in the airplane. A few seconds later, the airplane passed behind a stand of trees and out of sight. He went to the impact site and found the wreckage but not the pilot. First responders reported that the wreckage was mangled and spread across a soybean field in a southerly direction. Ground scars at the accident site indicated that the airplane impacted the ground at a high velocity in a wings-level, slightly nose-down attitude and inverted. The engine and propeller assembly exhibited evidence consistent with high power at impact. All of the flight control surfaces were accounted for at the main wreckage site. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit to all of the flight control surfaces, and no evidence indicated that any of the flight controls were disconnected or otherwise separated before impact. The pilot\u2019s body was found about 1 mile northwest of the airplane wreckage. Canopy parts were found about 3/4 mile northwest of the wreckage, and various pieces of the acrylic canopy were found scattered for about 1/2 mile southward.\u000b\u000bOne of the canopy roller tracks was not found. The found roller track exhibited deformations about 8 inches aft of the forward ends on its left and right sides consistent with the attachment rollers being pulled from their tracks in an upward direction. The pilot and copilot lap seat belts were found attached to their respective anchor points with no evidence of overload failures or stresses on any of the latching blades or buckles consistent with the buckles not being latched at the time of impact.\u000b\u000bThe pilot\u2019s autopsy findings did not show any evidence of incapacitation, and toxicological tests were negative for drugs and alcohol. The on-scene evidence indicates that the airplane was likely controllable and that the engine was producing power at the time of impact. Given the location of the pilot\u2019s body and the acrylic canopy parts and the witness\u2019s statement, it is likely that the pilot lost control of the airplane, which then inverted, and that the pilot subsequently fell through the open canopy. The reason for the pilot\u2019s loss of control of the airplane could not be determined. \u000b\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s in-flight loss of control. Contributing to the pilot\u2019s fatal injury was his failure to use the available restraint systems, which resulted in him falling through the open canopy when the airplane inverted."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.Witnesses stated that they observed the twin-engine airplane roll into a steep right bank and enter a spin at a low altitude (less than 700 feet) during the initial climb. The airplane then descended and impacted terrain about 1.5 miles from the end of the departure runway. Some witnesses reported hearing an unusual engine noise just before the airplane began to roll and spin. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed.Examination of the right engine revealed that the ring gear support of the engine/propeller gearbox had fractured in flight due to high cycle fatigue originating from the corner radii of the high-speed pinion cutout. The reason for the fatigue could not be determined. The ring gear support disengaged from the ring gear due to this failure, resulting in a disconnection in power being transferred from the engine power section to the propeller.  In addition to the ability for a pilot to manually feather the propellers, and an automatic feathering feature, the engine (Honeywell TPE-331) design also includes a \u201cNegative Torque Sensing\u201d (NTS) system that would automatically respond to a typical failed engine condition involving a propeller that is driving the coupled engine. Feathering the propeller reduces drag and asymmetric yawing due to the failed engine.  All Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification evaluations for one-engine inoperative handling qualities for the airplane type were conducted with the NTS system operational. According to the airplane manufacturer, the NTS system was designed to automatically reduce the drag on the affected engine to provide a margin of safety until the pilot is able to shut down the engine with the condition lever.However, if a drive train disconnect occurs at the ring gear support, the NTS system is inoperable, and the propeller can come out of feather on its own, if the disconnect is followed by a pilot action to retard the power lever on the affected engine. In this scenario, once the fuel flow setting is reduced below the point required to run the power section at 100% (takeoff) rpm, the propeller governor would sense an \u201cunderspeed\u201d condition and would attempt to increase engine rpm by unloading the propeller, subsequently driving the propeller out of feather toward the low pitch stop. This flat pitch condition would cause an increase in aerodynamic drag on one side of the airplane, and unanticipated airplane control difficulty could result due to the asymmetry. The emergency procedure for an in flight power loss, regardless of the cause, published in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)  required that the power lever for the failed engine be moved forward to the Takeoff position (following the step to immediately shut down the engine by moving the condition lever to the Emergency Stop position).  Additionally, a \u201cWARNING\u201d follows this procedure to reiterate that the pilot must \u201c\u2026NOT RETARD FAILED ENGINE POWER LEVER.\u201d  The warning also states: \u201cPLACE FAILED ENGINE POWER LEVER TO TAKEOFF POSITION DURING THE FEATHERING OF PROPELLER AND LEAVE THERE FOR REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT.\" Postcrash examination of the wreckage revealed evidence that both condition levers were in the \u201cTakeoff/Land\u201d position. The left engine power lever was in the \u201cReverse\u201d position, and the right engine power lever was in the \u201cFlight Idle\u201d position.Based on an analysis of evidence from the wreckage and technical data from the airframe and engine manufacturers, a likely scenario for the accident sequence is as follows:  Shortly after takeoff, and after being instructed to change frequencies, the pilot may have perceived a loss of power in the right engine and an associated rise in rpm.  The right propeller then went into a feathered position about 3 seconds later.  The pilot then reduced the right engine power lever, contrary to the AFM procedure.  At this point, the fuel flow decreased, leading to a decrease in power section rpm.  The propeller governor then sensed an under-speed condition. As a result, oil was routed to the propeller by the propeller governor, causing the propeller to come out of feather toward a flat pitch (increased drag) position. The pilot may not have been aware that the propeller came out of feather. As a result of the increased drag condition on the right side of the airplane, the airplane yawed and rolled to the right and entered a spin. In an attempt to control the airplane, the pilot reduced power on the opposite (left) engine.  However, at this point, the airplane was not at a sufficient altitude to recover.The investigation revealed that a TPE331 engine gearbox uncoupling event is an unusual engine failure that results in substantially different engine indications to a pilot in comparison to a typical flameout event in which the NTS system in operable. According to the engine manufacturer, there have been five incidents of similar TPE331 ring gear support cracks during about 29 million engine hours of service history. All of the cracks originated at the high-speed pinion cutout detail. Three of these incidents were shop findings, one incident resulted in an in-flight shutdown at altitude followed by a safe landing, and the other incident was this accident.The accident pilot reportedly accumulated 11,000 hours of total pilot experience, 2,000 of which were in the same make and model as the accident airplane. About 300 hours were logged within the previous six months of the accident. The pilot received recurrent training the same make and model about 11 months before the accident.On March 3, 2008, the airplane manufacturer published MU-2 Service News No. 110/00-017, entitled \u201cPower Lever Position Warning for In-flight Engine Failure\u201d which reiterated the warning that the failed engine power lever must not be retarded. In January 2009, the airplane manufacturer also published Service News No.114/00-020, entitled \u201cEngine Failure Modes,\u201d which provided additional detail for pilots regarding an uncoupled gearbox, and again reiterated the AFM procedure and warning. In addition, the engine manufacturer intends to issue a letter to provide a description of the engine symptoms and recommended actions in the event of an uncoupling event, or in the event of an engine failure for any reason.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot\u2019s loss of aircraft control during the initial climb which was precipitated by the sudden loss of thrust and increase in drag from the right engine, and the pilot\u2019s failure to adhere to the published emergency procedures regarding the position of the failed engine power lever.  Contributing to the accident was the fatigue failure of the right engine\u2019s ring gear support for undetermined reasons, which rendered the propeller\u2019s automatic drag reducing system inoperative."

The private pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The flight had an intended destination of Palm Beach County Park Airport (LNA), West Palm Beach, Florida. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan had been filed. The airplane was owned by The Wildwood Helicopter Company, Inc. and operated by Palm Beach Flight Training. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to an eyewitness, the airplane was observed descending into the water and the engine could be heard operating.The airplane was found in the Florida Bay, in about 9 feet of water. The debris path was about 300 feet in length. The engine remained attached to the airplane through lines, wires, and cables, and was collocated with the main wreckage. The propeller was impact separated at the propeller flange, and was located about 300 feet from the main wreckage. All three propeller blades exhibit cord wise bending. The wreckage debris path was oriented on a line that ran parallel to the shore, which was located on a 320 degree heading and about 1.5 miles from the MTH.Examination revealed that the airplane exhibited impact and crush damage to both wings, cabin, and fuselage. The airplane was segmented into numerous pieces. The right side stabilator was damaged in the aft and positive direction at an approximate 45 degree angle. The right wing main spar exhibited an approximate 50 degree twist. Impact and crush damage was consistent with the airplane impacting the water in a right wing low, nose down attitude. An outboard portion of the left wing, left wing aileron, and main cabin door were unable to be located. Examination of the engine revealed crankshaft and valve train continuity from the propeller flange to the rear accessory pad. Thumb compression was noted on all cylinders. A fluid, similar in smell as 100LL Aviation fuel was present in all fuel lines and in the fuel pump.  Flight control continuity was confirmed from the base of the control column to the aileron bellcranks, located in each wing and the stabilator. One of the two rudder cables exhibited tensile overload; however, rudder control continuity was confirmed from the pilot's rudder pedals to the rudder.According to fuel records located at MTH, the airplane was fueled with 16.8 gallons of \"Avgas.\" The credit card receipt associated with the refueling had a time stamp of 1430:49 on August 9, 2015. The fuel order also indicated \"Top off all tanks.\"According to the United States Naval Observatory, Sun and Moon Data, official sunset was at 2003 and end of civil twilight was 2027 the moonset occurred at 1703 and 15% of the moon disc would have been visible had the moon been above the horizon.",

About one minute later, the flight crew heard a loud bang and felt the airplane shudder. The airplane then began to roll to the left, and nearly full right control wheel input was required to counter the left roll. The flight crew performed a missed approach, declared an emergency, and diverted to another airport. During the landing, the airplane experienced a tailstrike.  The flight control malfunction was initiated by the failure of the bolt assemblies securing the left inboard flap outboard hinge to the wing trailing edge. The lower outboard nut failed first due to stress corrosion cracking. The lower inboard bolt failure was initiated by fatigue and was completed by overload following the failure of the nut on the lower outboard bolt. The two upper bolts failed by overload following the failure of both lower bolt assemblies. The failure of all four bolt assemblies allowed the flap hinge to pull free from the wing trailing edge, drop and jam the left, inboard flap at the fully extended position. The separating flap hinge pulled the components of the left hand spoiler system from their original position resulting in the deployment of spoilers L1, L4, and L5. The deployment of three of the five left-hand spoilers caused the uncommanded left roll of the aircraft.  Hydraulic system no. 3 was also damaged when the flap hinge separated allowing the hydraulic fluid to drain out of the system. Once the hydraulic quantity is depleted, the number three spoilers on each wing will not operate. According to Boeing engineers, the loss of the R3 spoiler would affect the ability of the right wing flight controls to counter the left roll of the aircraft.  The airplane was originally used as a manufacturer flight test airplane.  The impact of the flight-testing of the airplane to the overall fatigue life of the flap hinge bolts could not be determined.  Prior to the accident, there were no requirements for the inspection of the flap hinge bolt assemblies on MD-11 aircraft. The manufacturer issued a service bulletin after the accident recommending inspection and/or replacement of the flap hinge, lower bolt assemblies. The bulletin recommends changing from alloy steel bolts and nuts to Inconel. Inconel is a nickel-based alloy that is highly resistant to general corrosion and stress corrosion cracking, which can occur in low alloy, high strength steel. The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating the Service Bulletin.",

The commercial pilot sustained serious injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by N224TB, LLC, of Austin, Texas, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight, which had the intended destination of Burnet Municipal Airport (BMQ), Burnet, Texas.According to the co-owner of the airplane, in the weeks preceding the accident flight, the airplane had been experiencing an intermittent lack of manifold pressure that resulted in reduced engine power. On the day of the accident, before the accident flight, the pilot had identified that the engine was not developing maximum takeoff power and called the co-owner to tell him that he was going to fly the airplane to BMQ to be examined by a mechanic.The airport manager, who was also a witness to the accident, reported that she observed the accident airplane abort a takeoff on runway 17 (5,977 feet by 100 feet, asphalt) after it did not appear to accelerate normally on the takeoff run. After the aborted takeoff, the airplane taxied back to the north end of the airport for another takeoff attempt. She recalled that the airplane did not come to a stop before turning off the taxiway onto the runway and that the airplane immediately made another takeoff attempt. She reported that, on the second takeoff attempt, the airplane did not appear to accelerate normally and that she became concerned when it was still on the runway after it passed the Fixed Base Operator (FBO) building that was located about midfield. She recalled that the airplane eventually became airborne about 4,000 feet down the runway. After liftoff, the airplane was observed in a shallow climb before the airplane suddenly rolled to the left and descended into trees and terrain.Two motorists, who were driving west on Highway 71, reported seeing the accident airplane descend in a left wing low attitude into trees and the roadway.

The pilot was in the traffic pattern and attempted to execute a forced landing on the departure runway.  However, the glide path was not sufficient to reach the runway and the airplane impacted a road and ditch adjacent to the airport.  This was the first flight of the airplane.  The pilot was the owner and builder of the aircraft.  The pilot stated that after takeoff,  he experienced a \"very quick\" 8-knot reduction in airspeed.  The loss in airspeed was followed by a reduction in engine exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  The pilot noted that the loss of airspeed felt like \"someone momentarily deployed a speed brake but the airspeed remained at the lower speed.\"  He recalled that the fuel pressure indicated 10 pounds per square inch (psi) at that time. The pilot stated that when he reached a point abeam the end of the runway and began a 180-degree turn to final approach for landing, a second airspeed reduction occurred.  He reported that while maintaining a 65-knot glide speed, the glide path would not allow a landing on the runway.  The pilot reported that the field adjacent to the airport was too small to permit a safe landing.  Because there was no traffic on the road adjoining the airport, he elected to dive toward it in an effort to maintain enough airspeed to pull up and land in a grass area off the end of the runway.  However, the airplane's nose wheel caught the edge of the roadway and the aircraft slid across the road and into a ditch.  A post-accident inspection revealed that a piece of silicone rubber sealant obstructed the inlet of the internal engine fuel filter.  The pilot/builder reported that to the best of his knowledge the sealant material was not used in the construction of the airplane and he was unsure of the source.  In addition, a Federal Aviation Administration inspector examined the airplane.  He noted that several bends in the fuel lines were flattened and did not have a uniform cross-section at those locations.",

Despite troubleshooting efforts, the pilot was unable to restore engine power; he stated that he heard intermittent backfire noise from the engine. While troubleshooting, the pilot banked the airplane back toward the airport but it was not at sufficient altitude to reach it, so he chose to land on a trail road. The pilot had to steer the airplane to the right to avoid a large pipe. Subsequently, the airplane\u2019s right wing contacted corn stalks, and the airplane came to rest in the cornfield. The airplane was equipped with an optional engine primer system, which included an electrically operated primer diverter valve connected to two primer nozzles, located in the metered fuel supply line between the air throttle valve and the manifold valve on each side of the engine. Actuation of the engine primer switch operates the auxiliary electric fuel pump and energizes the diverter valve that supplies fuel to each primer nozzle.

At that time, the reported weather was scattered clouds at 900 feet above ground level (agl), an overcast ceiling at 3,500 feet agl, and a visibility of 3 miles.  At the time of the accident, the airport's reported weather was 300 feet agl overcast ceiling and a 1-1/4 mile visibility.  The flight was cleared for the VOR-A instrument approach procedure, circle to land runway 27.  According to aircraft radar track data, the airplane descended below the approach's authorized minimum descent altitude (MDA) about 2.6 miles northeast of the airport.

(The total fuel capacity was 26 gallons, of which 3.5 gallons were unusable.) She was unable to measure the fuel because she had dropped the measuring stick into the fuel tank. The flight departed, and, about 1 hour 15 minutes after departure and about 10 miles from the destination airport, the engine lost total power. The pilot unsuccessfully tried to restart the engine and subsequently performed a forced landing to a field. No anomalies were found with the engine that would have precluded normal operation. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the fuel tanks were not breached and that they contained a total of 1/2 gallon of fuel. The pilot reported that, before departing the airport, she checked the weather, which indicated that wind aloft conditions were a left quartering headwind at 6 knots. However, the wind aloft report from a station about 10 nautical miles from the accident location indicated that the wind aloft conditions ranged from a quartering headwind of 10 to 35 knots depending on the altitude of flight, which increased the duration of the flight. The pilot stated that the engine consumed about 4.4 to 5.6 gallons of fuel per hour; however, a review of the airplane owner\u2019s manual performance charts revealed that the engine could consume up to 7 gallons of fuel per hour. Because of the headwind, the flight was 1 hour 15 minutes, which would have required up to 8.75 gallons of fuel; however, the pilot took off with about 6.5 to 8.5 gallons of usable fuel. Thus, it is likely that the airplane did not have enough fuel to reach the destination airport, and the engine lost total power as a result of fuel exhaustion. ",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various entities, including, but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration and/or the operator and did not travel in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft accident report.According to the pilot, headwinds were stronger than expected, so he diverted the tailwheel, amphibious airplane to an en route airport. Broadcasted wind was from 280 degrees true at 10 knots, so the pilot elected to fly a right traffic pattern to land on runway 22. Upon touchdown, and during rollout with full aileron deflection, either a gust of wind or rotor turbulence lifted the right wing and exceeded the aileron's ability to keep the wing down. The pilot attempted to add power for a go around, but the airplane drifted to the left and ground looped to the left. It then spun about 180 degrees and rolled backwards off the runway. The tail wheel and right main wheel hit a slight rise and dug in. The wind then lifted the left wing and flipped the airplane over. Weather, recorded about 15 minutes after the accident, indicated varying winds from about 280 degrees to 340 degrees at 8 knots.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inability to maintain directional control during a crosswind landing."
