The touchdown was 642 feet past the approach end of the runway.  Vref was calculated to be 108 kts; however, data from the EGPWS showed the ground speed was about 137 kts, 9 seconds before touchdown, and at touchdown, the speed was estimated to be about 130 kts.  After touchdown, the pilot selected ground flaps, which moved the flaps from 35 degrees to 60 degrees, the spoilers auto-deployed, and the speed brakes were extended.  The pilot said that after applying the brakes, he felt the brakes pedals pulsing, and did not think the airplane was slowing.  He released the brakes for a few seconds and then reapplied them.  Again, he felt the pulsing in the pedals, but the airplane was not slowing as he expected.  He released the brakes, reset the flaps to takeoff, and applied power to abort the landing when he was about halfway down the runway.  The airplane departed the end of the runway and traveled for about 300 feet.  Skid marks revealed the initial touchdown was most like made with brakes applied, and no locked wheel crossover protection.  Additional skid marks revealed the airplane became airborne after touchdown, and in the next 750 ft, touched down 3 more times, each subsequent touchdown occurring without the full weight of the airplane on the  wheels.  Tire marks on the last half of the runway were consistent with brakes applied and anti-skid operative.  Using the approved flight manual standards, the airplane would have required 3,155 feet to stop.  This was predicated on crossing the threshold at 50 feet, at Vref, and included a ground roll of 1,895 feet.  However, the pilot touched down at 642 feet from the threshold, which left sufficient runway for stopping.  Using the pilot's touchdown point of 642 feet, the airplane was capable of stopping on the runway with a Vref as high as 120 kts.  The approach was unstabilized with 4 aural warnings, including 2 sink rate warnings on final approach, the last of which occurred with a descent rate of over 1,700 fpm down, 19 seconds prior to touchdown, and about 400 feet above the ground.

The personal flight was conducted in night, instrument meteorological conditions and no flight plan was filed. The flight departed from Fayette County Airport (FYE), Somerville, Tennessee, about 1915.According to the wife of the pilot, she last saw the airplane in their hanger on the night of the accident. She believed that her husband was going to taxi over to the fuel pumps to refuel the airplane for a trip he was planning. When he did not come home that evening she contacted the local authorities to report that her husband was missing. The local sheriff's department searched the airport and did not locate the airplane. The Federal Aviation Administration was contacted by the sheriff's department and an Alert Notice (ALNOT) was issued.A witness stated that, on the night of the accident, it was dark and misting. He heard an airplane flying overhead, and then heard the engine \"rev up\" before hearing a loud crash. The witness said that he believed he heard an airplane crash but did not report the incident to the local authorities.

As the airplane descended to the traffic pattern, the pilot noticed the airspeed decrease from 145 knots to 85 knots. The pilot applied full power but did not observe an increase in airspeed. He elected to continue the approach and, due to weather conditions, joined the traffic pattern for runway 7. It is likely that the pilot felt pressure to complete the flight due to the deteriorating weather conditions, rather than taking time to identify and correct the anomaly or to attempt to cross-reference with other instruments. When the pilot deployed the wing flaps and extended the landing gear, he noted that the airplane felt as though it was traveling faster than its indicated airspeed. The airplane touched down approximately 1,000 feet past the runway threshold and bounced. The pilot attempted to apply brakes, but reported that the braking action was \"nil\" due to runway contamination. The airplane continued down the runway, departed the paved surface, and came to rest 366 feet past the runway\u2019s end.

Unregulated air pressure was applied to the right pitot tube and to the left pitot line downstream of the tube. The corresponding airspeed indicators displayed needle movement with no leaks detected.

The captain stated that the No. 2 engine gages went to zero, and there was no indication of fire. He further stated that the copilot continued flying the aircraft, and stayed in the pattern, returning for an otherwise uneventful landing.

During the accident takeoff roll, about 400 feet down the strip, the airplane encountered a dip in the terrain and briefly became airborne. The airplane settled back onto the runway and the pilot continued the takeoff, rotating airborne about 100 feet prior to a cornfield off the departure end of the runway.

No communications were received from the pilot after he acknowledged the takeoff clearance. Witnesses reported that white smoke appeared to be trailing from the area of the left engine during takeoff. The witnesses subsequently observed flames at the inboard side of the left engine. The airplane began a left turn. As the airplane continued the turn, the flames and trail of white smoke were no longer visible. When the airplane reached a southerly heading, the nose dropped abruptly, and the airplane descended to the ground. Witnesses stated that they heard an increase in engine sound before impact. A postimpact fire ensued. The accident site was located about 3/4 mile from the airport. A postaccident examination determined that the left engine fuel selector and fuel valve were in the OFF position, consistent with the pilot shutting down that engine after takeoff. However, the left engine propeller was not feathered. Extensive damage to the right engine propeller assembly was consistent with that engine producing power at the time of impact. The landing gear and wing flaps were extended at the time of impact. Teardown examinations of both engines did not reveal any anomalies consistent with a loss of engine power. The left engine oil cap was observed to be unsecured at the accident site; however, postaccident comparison of the left and right engine oil caps revealed disproportionate distortion of the left oil cap, likely due to the postimpact fire. As a result, no determination was made regarding the security of left engine oil cap before the accident. Emergency procedures outlined in the pilot\u2019s operating handbook (POH) noted that when securing an engine, the propeller should be feathered. Performance data provided in the POH for single-engine operations were predicated on the propeller of the inoperative engine being feathered, and the wing flaps and landing gear retracted. Thus, the pilot did not follow the emergency procedures outlined in the POH for single-engine operation. ",

One co-owner held a private pilot certificate, and the other held a student pilot certificate; neither held an aircraft mechanic's certificate. About 2 weeks after the purchase, the co-owners and a mechanic drove to the airport to examine the airplane, with the reported intent to fly it about 75 miles back to the home airport of the pilot-rated co-owner. Some maintenance activity and a brief test flight were conducted, but mechanical and weather difficulties prevented the relocation of the airplane that day. The following week the three returned to the airplane, and the pilot and mechanic flew it to the pilot's home airport. The next week, the pilot flew the airplane to the student pilot's home airport, and the two then departed, with the student pilot in the left seat. It could not be determined what roles or actions were conducted by either of the individuals during the flight. That flight ended several minutes later, when the airplane impacted a wooded area in a residential neighborhood. First responders noticed a slight odor of fuel; one fuel tank was breached and contained no fuel, and the other, intact tank contained only a trace amount of fuel. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the fuel strainer contained cloudy fuel contaminated by water and other unidentified contaminants and that the carburetor accelerator pump gasket was deformed. The general overall appearance of the airplane was consistent with it not being well-maintained, but no evidence of any preimpact airframe discrepancies that would have precluded normal flight was observed. The only fuel purchase that could positively be associated with the airplane indicated that 17 gallons were added on the day of the test flight, 2 weeks before the accident. Calculations that used the manufacturer's fuel consumption rates indicated that the total fuel consumption for the period between that last verified fueling and the accident flight ranged from a low of 13 gallons to a high of 32 gallons. The manufacturer specified a total usable fuel quantity of 39 gallons, but the total fuel on board after the last verified fueling could not be determined.",

The CFI shortened the approach and landed in the first field.  On the landing roll the nose wheel dug into the dirt and the airplane nosed over.

The accident pilot informed the second pilot over the radio frequency that he was climbing between 300 to 500 feet per minute (fpm). About an hour later, the second pilot learned from another pilot at the departure airport that the accident pilot had not returned. A subsequent search over the area resulted in the second pilot spotting the wreckage in a canyon about 6 nautical miles southeast of the departure airport. Track-log data recovered from an onboard recording device revealed that, after takeoff, the glider ascended to an altitude of about 9,100 feet msl during the first eight minutes of the flight. Additionally, the track-log data showed that about 28 minutes into the flight, at an altitude of 8,800 feet msl, the glider began a progressive descent, which lasted about 15 minutes until the glider impacted remote mountainous terrain at an elevation of about 6,500 feet msl. During the last 2 minutes of the flight, the ground speed fluctuated twice over a 15-knot range and was at 40 knots just before the altitude dropped abruptly and the glider descended vertically to the ground elevation in the last 12 seconds. A postaccident examination of the accident site revealed the entire glider was located in the general area where the impact occurred, there was no linear distribution path, and no indication of an in-flight breakup.

The tow rope broke, and the glider impacted the ground in a near vertical descent.  The C-hook on the stabilator push rod, was found in front of, and not connected to the roller bearing on the stabilator.  The pilot's flight experience was over 3,000 hours with about 84 hours in gliders.  He had accumulated 28 hours in the accident glider, including 17 flights.  This was the first glider the pilot had operated, that he was required to disassemble for storage and reassemble for flight.  Witnesses reported the pilot experienced difficulty with the assembly process.  A view window was located on top of the stabilator to check for proper engagement of the C-hook, and the AFTER ASSEMBLY checklist called for it to be used to check for proper assembly.  A witness reported the pilot moved the control stick in the cockpit and observed movement of the flight controls, but he was not observed to actually check the view window for proper assembly.  A check of another glider of the same make and model found it was possible to lock the stabilator in place on top of the vertical stabilizer, with the C-hook in the same place as found on the accident glider.  In this configuration, the control rod that held the C-hook was pressed against the roller bearing and held in place by friction.  However, the incorrect assembly was visible through the view window on top of the stabilator, and when the stabilator was held in place, it was still possible to move the cockpit control stick abut 1 inch forward or aft, with no corresponding movement on the stabilator.",

The pilot said that about 6-7 miles from the airport, in the terminal descent, he noticed the right engine torque meter read zero.  This had occurred before, and the torque would come back if he manipulated the throttle.  He continued the normal approach for landing.  In the landing flare the airplane yawed right despite his corrective left rudder pedal input.  The airplane landed hard, bouncing on the nose twice, breaking the nose wheel strut.  It then slid about 2,000 feet down the runway.  The ferry pilot, who flew the airplane to the repair facility after the accident, said that the engine power levers were consistently split throughout the entire ferry flight.  In order to have the engine power perimeters matched, the right power lever had to be about 2 inches forward of the left one and this positional relationship was constant from flight idle to full power.  Maintenance records had no record of compliance to Mitsubishi Service Bulletin No. 097/73-001, which was published  \"to assure the engine and propeller rigging is adjusted within manufactures specifications and to prevent potential degraded flight handling qualities associated with the flight idle power being set asymmetrically or too low.\"",

The power loss was due to a minimum fuel flow command from the fuel control unit as a result of the seizure of the fuel control flyweights.  The seizure of the flyweights was due to their contamination with residue from a failed fuel control tachometer drive bearing. The bearing failed due to its preload spacer being machined incorrectly, and due to the failure of the assembling technician to detect the anomaly at the time the fuel control was assembled.",

Before the pilot\u2019s arrival at the airport, he phoned the operator\u2019s facility and requested that the fuel tanks be filled. The fuel tanks were filled as requested, and after his arrival at the operator\u2019s facility, he requested that the customer service representative take the flight instructor\u2019s name off the reservation and put his name on it because he did not want the flight instructor responsible in case anything were to occur. This comment was overheard by the flight instructor, prompting him to reassure the pilot that they would have a good flight. The pilot was given the book and keys for the airplane and went to it, started the engine, taxied out, and departed from runway 9 about 7:14 am without the flight instructor.The flight instructor, who intended to fly with the pilot later, thought that the pilot was planning to execute several touch-and-go landings and takeoffs in advance of their lesson. When the pilot did not return, the instructor attempted to communicate with the pilot on a VHF frequency; however, the pilot did not respond. Uncorrelated radar data tracked the airplane from takeoff until it was lost from radar while over the Gulf of Mexico. The uncorrelated radar data indicates that after takeoff, the pilot proceeded northwest where he orbited several times, then proceeded south, flying over the Gulf of Mexico. The flight climbed to a maximum altitude of 13,100 feet mean sea level (msl), then descended to 10,900 feet msl, where 3-D modeling indicates the flight penetrated level 2 radar returns, which are known to have light to moderate turbulence, precipitation, updrafts and downdrafts.

About 3 hours 19 minutes after takeoff, the airplane was lost from radar; a search for the airplane was initiated by the U.S. Coast Guard; however, no wreckage, debris, or the pilot\u2019s body were ever located.

The certificated commercial pilot and two passengers sustained no injuries. The airplane was registered to the United States Department of the Interior, and operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a public aircraft operations flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan was filed and activated.During an interview with a Department of the Interior, Senior Air Safety Investigator, the pilot stated that the selected airstrip consisted of a dogleg of about 150 feet, followed by about a 25-degree right turn for an additional takeoff area of about 1,000 feet, totaling about 1,150 feet of available takeoff distance. About 100 feet after making the required turn, the pilot realized he had not made enough correction to the right to get lined up with the straight portion of the takeoff area and was drifting left. The airplane became airborne after contacting a berm about 5 feet in height, entered an aerodynamic stall, impacted the tundra in a left wing down attitude, bounced, and came to rest about 180 degrees from the takeoff heading.The closest weather reporting facility is Cold Bay Airport, Cold Bay, Alaska, approximately 85 miles northeast of the accident site. At 1253, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) from the Cold Bay Airport was reporting in part: wind from 160 degrees at 7 knots; sky condition, few at 500 feet agl, broken at 1,000 feet agl; visibility, 10 statute miles; temperature 55 degrees F; dewpoint 54 degrees F; barometric pressure 29.91inHG.",

Approximately 8 minutes after takeoff, radar indicated the airplane was at 11,200 feet msl, heading 241 degrees, with a ground speed of 180 knots.  No distress calls or additional communications with the pilot were recorded, and radar contact was lost.  The airplane impacted the ground in an uncontrolled descent.  The right wing tip tank separated from the airplane and was found 0.18 nautical miles from the main wreckage.  The teardown and examination of both engines disclosed that the type and degree of damage was indicative of engine power section rotation and operation at the time of impact.  There were no complete systems intact at the accident site due to the impact sequence and post-impact fire which consumed the aircraft.  The landing gear and flaps were found in the retracted position.  The portion of the right propeller shaft coupling found at the site was fractured through 360 degrees.  Metallurgical examination revealed that the propeller shaft coupling failed in fatigue.  The presence of the fatigue cracks indicated the coupler fractured in fatigue in service, and the fatigue cracks were not the result of ground impact.  The circumferential fracture intersected the ends of several internal spline teeth.  The origin of the fatigue crack could not be determined because of severe corrosion damage on the fracture surface.  Fatigue propagation was in the aft direction and from the inside to the outside of the coupling.  The engine core rotating components would have bee free to rotate when uncoupled from the propeller shaft.  The maintenance records indicated that the failed coupling had accumulated approximately 4,000 hours since new, and 1,250 hours since engine overhaul in 1989.  Since 1990, as a result of fatigue fractures, the manufacturer introduced several design changes for the propeller shaft coupling via optional Service Bulletins to be accomplished at the next access or hot section inspection (HSI).  Impact and thermal damage of the right propeller precluded a determination of the in-flight blade angles.  The calculations by the airplane manufacturer indicated that \"the [intact] airplane was capable of continued flight\" with the right propeller feathered, and that the \"airplane can keep attitude, but cannot climb and cannot maintain altitude\" with the right propeller in the flat pitch or wind milling positions, respectively.  Metallurgical examination of the component brackets and associated bolts from the right tip tank revealed the separation of the tip tank resulted from a single-event overstress fracture of both the forward and aft tank attachment fittings.  Calculations showed that a 3.763 radians per second (35.9 RPM) spin rate would cause the failure of the forward wing fuel tank attachment fitting.  There had not been a previous in-flight separation of a wing tip fuel tank on this model airplane. ",

After landing, he then taxied back to the runway, departed, circled the field for an additional 20 minutes, then returned to perform a touch-and-go landing. After touching down, adding power, and beginning the initial climb, the engine lost partial power and the engine's rpm decreased to about 3,000 rpm. Because the airplane was past the departure end of the runway, the pilot performed a water landing on a nearby reservoir. During the landing, the left lower wing struck the water and separated from its mounting location. After the airplane slowed, the pilot noticed that the engine was still running; however, when he advanced the throttle, the rpm would initially increase and then immediately decrease to 2,000 rpm. Examination of the airplane and engine revealed no mechanical failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. It was further noted that the engine was not equipped with a carburetor heat system or insulated fuel hoses, as recommended by the engine manufacturer. Due to the ambient air temperature at the time of the accident, it was improbable that vapor lock caused the partial loss of power. Review of a carburetor icing probability chart revealed that weather conditions were conducive for serious carburetor icing.

The helicopter was registered to, and operated by, the Kern County Sheriff's Department as a public-use flight. The commercial pilot, tactical flight officer (TFO), single passenger, and a dog were not injured. The helicopter sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence. The cross-country flight departed Meadows Field Airport, Bakersfield, California, about 0120, with a planned destination of General William J Fox Airfield, Lancaster, California. Marginal visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the accident site, and no flight plan had been filed.The purpose of the flight was to transport a dog from the Sheriff Department's Canine division to urgent care in Lancaster, after it was shot while on duty, about 3 hours prior to the accident.The pilot stated that he arrived at the air division headquarters in Bakersfield about 0100, and was briefed on the mission by the current on-duty command pilot. They discussed the weather, and he confirmed that visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at both the departure and arrival airports. He was aware that a weather front was moving through the area, and that he would most likely encounter IMC conditions while enroute. He planned to use Tehachapi airport as an alternate landing site should conditions deteriorate.At 0120, they loaded the injured dog into the rear left footwell, along with the Canine Division Chief who was seated in the rear right seat. The departure was uneventful, but as they approached Tehachapi they encountered light rain, strong wind, and low clouds. Both the pilot and the TFO were wearing Night Vision Goggles (NVG's) throughout the flight.The pilot decided to proceed, and wanted to see if Sand Canyon was passable. However, once they got beyond the lights of the city, he lost visual reference after flying into what appeared to be clouds. He reported flying at about 500 feet agl at that time, and was concerned that returning might cause them to collide with obstacles in the area such as wind turbines. He elected to slow the helicopter and initiate a gradual descent with the hope of exiting the clouds. During the descent he realized that the windshield had in fact fogged up, and as such, he turned on the demister. A short time later a highway suddenly came into view and the helicopter struck the ground.The helicopter struck the highway surface, bounced back into the air, and rotated about 180 degrees. The pilot maintained a low hover and could now see the lights of Tehachapi ahead. The helicopter appeared to be handling normally, and was not vibrating or making any unusual sounds, so he elected to return to Tehachapi Airport. Before landing he asked the TFO to open the door to observe the skids; they appeared intact. The TFO attempted to utilize the Forward Looking Infrared Camera (FLIR) mounted on the nose, and rear-mounted \"Nightsun\" searchlight to assist with the landing, but they were both inoperative. The helicopter then landed uneventfully.Subsequent examination revealed that the helicopter sustained substantial damage to the belly structure, with the skids having been spread about 2 feet beyond their normal stance. The FLIR and searchlight both sustained crush damage to their lower cowlings, and the tailskid appeared to have struck the ground.",

The glider then began a smooth pitch up and a wingover-type maneuver in a presumed effort to return for landing. During the maneuver, the glider stalled and spun to the ground. The pilot had arrived at the airfield earlier in the week for a fly-in, and had flown the glider uneventfully twice since arriving. Witnesses, who were also friends of the pilot, expressed astonishment that he performed the low pass and wingover maneuver, stating that such a flamboyant maneuver was completely out of character.The pilot purchased the vintage glider about 4 years before the accident, and the fly-in was the first time he had flown it. He held a commercial pilot certificate for gliders and powered airplanes, and had accumulated extensive experience flying hang gliders and paragliders.

All passengers on the flight were utilizing supplemental oxygen from the airplane's oxygen system.  The passenger was supported in an upright, seated position as the flight returned to the departure airport where she was met by emergency medical personnel and transported by ambulance, lying down on a stretcher.   The passenger regained consciousness en route to a hospital for initial treatment where diagnostic studies were consistent with heart attack and congestive heart failure.   Although her initial diagnosis included possible high altitude pulmonary and cerebral edema, this is unlikely since the flight was less than 1 hour and these symptoms usually occur only after a day or more exposure to high altitude.  The passenger's condition was most likely related to her previous history of heart disease, exacerbated by exposure to decreased oxygen supply, and continuous vertical position for many minutes following her loss of consciousness.  The passenger was subsequently released for in-home rehabilitation two months later with a diagnosis of an anoxic brain injury.  According to the pilot's operating handbook, the FAA approved passenger oxygen mask for the incident airplane is a partial rebreather mask equipped with a reservoir bag at a flow rate of 1.5 or 2.0 liters per minute, however, on the incident flight, the passengers were using a disposable, hospital type oxygen mask without a reservoir bag, at a flow rate of 1.5 liters per minute.  FAA oxygen system certification standards, at 21,000 feet, require a minimum flow rate of about 1.8 liters per minute, and the recommended upper altitude limit for use of an oxygen mask without a reservoir bag is 15,000 feet.  Following the incident, the operator changed the passenger oxygen masks to an FAA approved mask with a reservoir bag, at a flow rate of 3.0 liters per minute.",

The airport is on the coast next to the ocean with mountains immediately adjacent to the east that rise to 3,000 feet msl.  A witness saw the airplane depart to the south in dense fog with the ground visibility less than 1/4-mile and follow the coastline until entering the fog layer.  The witness noted that the direction of flight was unusual; typically, airplanes depart to the north, then turn left over the ocean to avoid the mountains.  After the airplane entered the fog layer it climbed to about 500 to 700 feet above ground level (agl) and then made a 90-degree turn to the left toward the mountains.  The airspace overlying the airport is Class G and there is no radar coverage in the area below 6,000 feet.  The left-seated pilot held an instrument rating; the right-seated pilot did not.  Both pilots had made flights together to this airport twice before (about 11 days prior to the accident and 2 days prior to the accident).  Numerous residents around the airport reported that a dense fog surrounded the airport and cloaked the mountains.  One witness stated that as he drove his automobile up the mountains away from the coastline, he came out of the clouds around 1,300 feet mean sea level (msl).  Records maintained at the Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) disclosed that the pilot contacted the facility twice for weather information.  During the first call, about 3 hours prior to departure, she requested a weather briefing.  The briefer advised that an AIRMET for instrument flight rule (IFR) conditions was current for the area.  He then queried her, \"how does it look outside?\"  The pilot responded by saying, \"It's foggy probably visibility is less than 2.\"  During her second telephone call, about 1 hour 45 minutes later, she was again told about the AIRMET for IFR conditions in the coastal areas and she filed an IFR flight plan requesting a direct routing and a 6,000 foot cruise altitude.  She called the AFSS again and received her IFR clearance \"as filed\"; no heading or other departure instructions was requested by the pilot nor given in the clearance.  The airport does not have a specified instrument departure.  Examination of the accident site revealed that the left wing hit a tree first in a wings level, slightly nose high attitude.  Post accident examinations revealed no mechanical anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.  The AFSS specialist who read the IFR clearance to the pilot was given the IFR clearance by the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) controller along with a clearance void time, but not a time check as required.  When the pilot did not communicate with the radar controller on or before the void time, the controller transmitted \"in the blind\" and did not receive a reply.  At that time, the controller should have considered the aircraft overdue and made the appropriate notifications, including issuing an Alert Notice (ALNOT), which would have initiated search and rescue efforts.  However, the controller, with approval from his supervisor, removed the flight plan from the system.  This action deleted any record of the flight and adversely impacted search and rescue efforts.  Although the actions of the ARTCC controllers did not cause or contribute to this accident, their performance hindered the timeliness of search and rescue efforts.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's loss of situational awareness with regard to the airplane's proximity to mountainous terrain, and her failure to maintain an adequate terrain clearance altitude or flight path, which resulted in an in-flight collision with the terrain."

The flight did not reach its destination, and was reported overdue.   Search personnel searched along the airplane's anticipated route of flight, over ocean waters. Shortly after initiation of the search, airborne search personnel reported sighting floating debris, consisting of what appeared to be aircraft seats, cardboard boxes, and small portions of aircraft wreckage, about 30.5 miles southwest of the flight's departure airport, and about 10 miles from shore.  The airplane is presumed to have sunk in ocean waters estimated to be between 50 and 70 feet deep.  Underwater search and recovery efforts were unsuccessful, and the airplane, pilot, and passenger remain missing.  A review of archived radar data disclosed that as the accident airplane approached an area about 30.5 miles southwest of the departure airport, it descended to 500 feet msl, and then entered a right turn.  As the turn progressed, the airplane continued to descend to 400 feet msl, with a radar-derived ground speed of 180 knots.

The engine subsequently lost all power and, in response, the pilot initiated a forced landing to a highway. During the landing, the airplane's right wing struck a pole and the lower forward portion of the fuselage sustained substantial damage. Examination of the engine revealed that it seized due to a loss of lubrication after the oil suction screen became clogged with debris, which included fractured portions of piston skirts and piston rings. The No. 5 cylinder oil control ring was fractured in multiple locations. Some fragments were burnished, consistent with operation for a significant time period while remaining in the piston ring slot. The burnishing obliterated the fractured face, making the determination of the fracture mode impossible. Thermal erosion of the No. 5 piston and the fracturing of the piston skirts occurred after the oil control ring failure and most likely occurred just prior to the engine failure. While it was possible that the ring was damaged at the time it was installed 266 hours before the accident, there was not enough information to reach that determination.",

The private pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was registered to, and being operated by, the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The personal flight originated from Cameron Airpark, Cameron Park, California, with a planned destination of Garberville. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.The purpose of the flight was for the pilot to make the routine 155-nautical-mile (nm) cross-country trip to Garberville, where he would stay for a week's duration and serve as the communities' Emergency Room (ER) doctor and the hospital's Medical Director. The pilot would make this trip about once per month and would telephone hospital staff to pick him up after he landed (usually between 1000 to 1100). There were numerous witnesses that observed the airplane maneuvering toward the airport at a very low altitude just below the cloud layer. Most witnesses estimated the airplane was about 100-200 feet above the tree tops. One witness, located on a hill about 1.5 nm southwest of the airport, stated that the airplane was lower than normal and the engine did not sound if it was producing full power (quitter than normal). Witnesses closer to the accident site noted that the airplane was not emitting any noise. The witness that was the closest to the impact stated that he heard a loud sound of a tree crashing and ran outside his house. He observed the airplane rotate about a tree and cartwheel into the river below. The accident site was located in the South Fork Eel River about 2,260 feet south of the approach end of runway 36 at Garberville. The airplane came to rest in the water partially resting on a gravel/sand embankment. The left wing was separated and entangled in debris on the south side of the river. Following the accident, the water level quickly rose, nearly submerging the entire airframe. The first identified point of contact consisted of a tree that contained a large gouge on the south-facing trunk area located about 60 to 70 feet above ground level (agl), which equated to about 20 feet below the top of the tree. Numerous branches and several pieces of airplane debris were located immediately below the tree, consistent with the left wing colliding with the trees prior to descending into the river.The wreckage is being retained for further examination.",

After takeoff, they noted that the cockpit gauges showed an opposite fuel imbalance of 4,100 & 3,600 lbs in the left & right tanks. Due to this indication, the PIC crossfed fuel from the left tank to both engines for about 30 min to rectify the perceived fuel imbalance.

The commercial pilot and his gunner were fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a public-use flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, which had departed Raton Municipal Airport (RTN), Raton, New Mexico, about 0615.The purpose of the flight was to locate and terminate coyotes in a predetermined geographical area with a history of livestock damage. A typical mission profile included locating coyotes with the aid of a ground-based spotter, after which the pilot would fly a low-altitude pass during which the rear-seated gunner would shoot the coyote with a shotgun. According to a GPS device recovered from the wreckage, at 0615:43 (hhmm:ss), the accident flight departed RTN and proceeded eastbound toward the target area. According to the ground-based spotter, the pilot established radio contact after the accident airplane had passed over the mesa that bordered the western edge of the target area. The pilot transmitted that he had located a coyote behind the spotter's position and that they were going to perform a low altitude pass for the gunner to terminate the coyote. The spotter turned around and located the coyote with the use of his binoculars. He reported that he heard 2-3 shotgun blasts as the airplane passed through his field-of-view on a northeast heading. He remained focused on the coyote as the airplane exited his field-of-view. The spotter reported that, shortly after the airplane had exited his field-of-view, he heard the sound of an impact. He looked up from his binoculars and saw that the airplane had crashed about 3/4 mile from his position.According to a preliminary review of the recovered GPS data, the airplane passed over the mesa that bordered the western edge of the target area about 165 feet above ground level (agl) and entered a descent on an easterly heading. At 0627:54, the airplane turned to a northeast heading and continued to descend. At that time the airplane was about 150 feet agl and had a ground speed of 115 miles per hour (mph). At 0628:32, the airplane had descended to about 42 feet agl and had a ground speed of 74 mph. The airplane then entered a climbing left turn. According to the GPS data, the airplane's ground speed decreased to about 62 mph during the climbing left turn. At 0628:41, the final GPS data point was recorded about 95 degrees into the left turn and the airplane had climbed to about 97 feet agl. The final GPS data point was about 232 feet northeast of the accident site.The wreckage was located in an open pasture with no trees or other obstructions in the general vicinity of the accident site. The aircraft wreckage was orientated on a 010 degree magnetic heading. The airplane was found in a near vertical attitude with the engine pushed back into the cabin. There was no appreciable wreckage propagation from the point-of-impact. The main wreckage consisted of the entire airframe, including all structural components and flight control surfaces. Flight control cable continuity was established from the forward cockpit controls to the individual control surfaces. The rear-seat control stick had been removed for the accident flight. The elevator trim jack screw was found in a neutral position. The cockpit flap handle was displaced aft during impact; however, the wing flaps appeared to be in the fully retracted position during the postaccident examination. Both wing tanks were damaged during the accident and did not contain any residual fuel during the postaccident examination; however, first responders reported that there was a substantial fuel odor at the accident site. The cockpit fuel selector was found in the BOTH position. The gascolator bowl contained a fluid consistent in color and odor to 100 low-lead aviation fuel. The gascolator fuel sample did not exhibit water or particulate contamination. The magneto switch was observed in the BOTH position before it was turned OFF by first responders. The stall warning horn was extracted from the right wing root and rewired to the wing-mounted lift sensor switch. Although the lift sensor switch had evidence of impact damage, the stall warning horn produced an aural tone when electrical power was applied and the switch contact was closed. The airspeed indicator exhibited a visible outline of the pointer that had been deposited on the gauge face. The observed white outline was pointed toward 69 mph. The propeller had separated from the engine crankshaft flange and was buried about 4 inches into the terrain. The propeller blades exhibited S-shape spanwise bending, chordwise scratches and polishing, and a leading edge gouge.The engine remained partially attached to the firewall by its mounts and control cables. Mechanical continuity was confirmed from the engine components to their respective cockpit controls. Internal engine and valve train continuity was confirmed as the engine crankshaft was rotated. Compression and suction were noted on all cylinders in conjunction with crankshaft rotation. The upper spark plugs were removed and exhibited features consistent with normal engine operation. Both magnetos provided spark on all leads when rotated. There were no obstructions between the air filter housing and the carburetor. The carburetor fuel bowl contained a liquid that was consistent with the color and odor of 100 low-lead aviation fuel. The fuel sample obtained from the carburetor bowl did not exhibit any water or particulate contamination.

Shortly after lift-off, the glider gained altitude abruptly and ascended to an altitude above the tow airplane.  The glider pilot reported that he had encountered \"severe turbulence\" and was caught in an \"extreme updraft.\"  He remembered looking up at the sky, losing sight of the tow airplane, and being \"jarred about the cockpit\" while attempting to disengage the towrope.  He recalled that his altimeter was indicating 440 feet agl approximately midway down the runway at the time he released the towrope, and he estimated the tow airplane to be 150 feet lower than his glider.  The glider completed a normal traffic pattern and landed on the runway.  The glider pilot mentioned that his glider had a tendency for the trim lever to release from its \"full nose down\" trim position, which is the recommended takeoff trim lever position, and \"snatch\" back to the \"full nose up\" position.  He remembered having to push forward during the initial climb to counteract a nose up effect.  A witness observed the glider gain altitude \"relatively abrupt\" and was able to detect that the glider was \"decidedly higher\" than the tow airplane.  He saw the glider break away to the east and thought the problem was over.  He continued to observe the tow airplane and stated that  from his position the airplane appeared to level off momentarily, and then \"nose dived and impacted the ground.\"  A pilot, whose tow flight had departed just prior to the accident, reported that the wind was approximately 9 knots, and he did not experience any turbulence or gusty wind conditions.  A functional check of the glider's trim operation was completed by placing the trim lever in the full nose down position (takeoff position) and then hand-tightened the wing nut, which is used to lock the lever in place.  The control stick was then pulled aft, and the trim lever would release almost immediately.  This procedure was repeated several times with the same result.

Review of the radar data showed the airplane descending from 9,200 feet at a rate of 2,000 feet per minute and a ground speed of 180 knots. At an altitude of about 3,000 feet, the ground speed was 178 knots and radar contact was lost. No radio transmissions were received from the pilot after radar contact was lost. Witnesses who were working in a field said they heard a loud \"popping\" sound. They looked up and saw an airplane and what looked like a wing separating from it. They continued to watch the airplane as it began to spin before crashing into the ground. Examination of the airplane revealed that the airplane wings had experienced high positive forces when the stabilizers broke in a downward direction. Once the stabilizers broke, the airplane immediately pitched down and changed rapidly from a high positive angle of attack (AOA) to a high negative AOA. The high negative air loads on the wings caused the right wing to break in a downward direction and caused the left wing and fuselage to rotate left wing down.Further breakup analysis indicated that there was no specific evidence of flutter. A review of the airplane flight manual revealed the never-exceed speed (VNE) for calculated and indicated airspeed was 176 knots. During the postaccident examination of the airspeed indicator, the indicator needle was stuck at the 192 mph position.

Multiple medications that had been prescribed for the pilot for the treatment of various conditions, including depression and anxiety, blood pressure, angina, high cholesterol, insomnia, and seizures were found during the subsequent investigation.  The investigation considered the possibilities of 1) pilot impairment/incapacitation and 2) suicide; however, the lack of physical evidence (the airplane and pilot remain missing) made such a determination impossible.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The airplane was substantially damaged when it overran the departure end of the runway during an aborted takeoff.  The crew attempted to reject the takeoff when the pilot flying could not rotate normally.  The aircraft is equipped with a two-position horizontal stabilizer system, which acts to reduce elevator control forces by repositioning the stabilizer two-degrees down for takeoff or landing.  The normal (cruise) position corresponds to one-degree up.  There are no intermediate positions.  The stabilizer is commanded to move to the takeoff position when the crew moves the cockpit flap handle out of the 0-degree (flaps up) detent.  The stabilizer was observed in the cruise position during the post-accident inspection.  Two independent warning systems are designed to alert the flight crew in the event that the horizontal stabilizer is not properly positioned for takeoff or landing.  A stabilizer mis-compare (STAB MIS COMP) annunciator warning is displayed when the flap handle and horizontal stabilizer are not in corresponding positions.  In addition, a no-takeoff warning (NO TAKEOFF) will be displayed when the aircraft is on the ground and the horizontal stabilizer is not in the proper position for takeoff.  As the throttles are advanced forward of the climb thrust setting, the no-takeoff annunciator light (NO TAKEOFF) will begin to flash and a master caution will be displayed.  A warning horn will sound associated with the no takeoff indication.  During the post-accident investigation, electrical power was applied to the aircraft.  Without changing any cockpit control settings, the STAB MIS COMP and NO TAKEOFF lights on the annunciator panel were illuminated.  Initial attempts to reposition the horizontal stabilizer were not successful.  Subsequent inspection of the aft fairing feedthru connector revealed an unseated (pushed-back) pin.  The pin provided electrical power to the hydraulic arming valve in order to allow repositioning of the horizontal stabilizer.  Further examination of the pin showed black marks near the tip consistent with electrical arcing.  When a new pin was installed, the horizontal stabilizer repositioned from cruise to takeoff/landing position as expected.  The stabilizer miscompare and no-takeoff warning systems were subsequently tested and performed in accordance with the flight and operating manual parameters.  The warning horn associated with the no-takeoff indication was heard over the cockpit speaker when the thrust levers were brought above the climb thrust setting.  The flight manual BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist noted that all annunciator lights should be extinguished except the ground idle light prior to initiating a takeoff.  The flight manual abnormal procedures checklist stated that when illuminated on the ground a STAB MISCOMP indication must be corrected prior to flight.  In addition, a no-takeoff indication required the takeoff be aborted.   The cockpit voice recorder was downloaded and transcribed.  The transcript revealed that the crew was aware that the horizontal stabilizer was not in the takeoff position prior to initiating the takeoff roll.  In addition, a sound similar to the no-takeoff warning horn was recorded over the cockpit area microphone during the takeoff roll and sounded for approximately twelve seconds before a rejected takeoff was initiated.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight crew's intentional operation with know deficiencies in the aircraft and their delay in aborting the takeoff when a no-takeoff warning was presented.  An additional cause was the crew's failure to comply with flight manual procedures concerning stabilizer miscompare and no-takeoff indications.  Contributing factors were the inoperative two-position horizontal stabilizer system due to the intermittent electrical connection at the aft fairing connector, as well as the runway approach lights impacted during the overrun."

The pilot advised the air traffic controller that he would be returning to the airport. While en route, the pilot noted a film of oil on the windshield. It became more pronounced, and the engine oil pressure dropped to \u201c0.\u201d  The pilot declared an emergency and landed the airplane on  an interstate highway median. An 8-foot section of the left wing separated when it collided with a highway traffic sign during the landing roll. The postaccident engine examination revealed that the oil leak was from the propeller governor gasket; specifically, the leak originated from the lower left lock nut area that secures the control cable tube end support bracket to the governor\u2019s engine-mounted stud. The nut and lock washer were not properly seated and anti-tamper putty was present. The disassembly of that area revealed that the lower left corner of the gasket had several cracks promulgating to that lower left section of the gasket, which permitted the oil to escape. The top section of the tube end of the support bracket was missing (broken off), which would not allow for an even mounting torque pressure between the gasket, the propeller governor, and the engine surfaces. A review of the airplane\u2019s maintenance records revealed no history of any discrepancies that would require the removal of the control cable support bracket tube end. Based on physical damage to the control cable bracket tube end, it is likely that, at an unknown time, the tube end was removed from the stud and damaged during installation. This did not permit a proper seal of the gasket, which created the leak.",
