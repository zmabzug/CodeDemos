The Aircraft Accident Report number is NTSB/AAR-11/04. On June 9, 2009, about 2135 mountain daylight time, an Agusta S.p.A. A-109E helicopter, N606SP, impacted terrain following visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The commercial pilot and one passenger were fatally injured; a highway patrol officer who was acting as a spotter during the accident flight was seriously injured. The entire aircraft was substantially damaged. The helicopter was registered to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety and operated by the New Mexico State Police (NMSP) on a public search and rescue mission under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. The helicopter departed its home base at Santa Fe Municipal Airport, Santa Fe, New Mexico, about 1850 in visual meteorological conditions; instrument meteorological conditions prevailed when the helicopter departed the remote landing site about 2132.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's decision to take off from a remote, mountainous landing site in dark (moonless) night, windy, instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were an organizational culture that prioritized mission execution over aviation safety and the pilot's fatigue, self-imposed pressure to conduct the flight, and situational stress. Also contributing to the accident were deficiencies in the NMSP aviation section's safety-related policies, including lack of a requirement for a risk assessment at any point during the mission; inadequate pilot staffing; lack of an effective fatigue management program for pilots; and inadequate procedures and equipment to ensure effective communication between airborne and ground personnel during search and rescue missions."

The pilot tried without success to set and release the brake to correct the stiff brake pedal. He radioed his base of operations to notify ground personnel of the possible brake problem and of his intention to return to the airfield. The pilot attempted to land the tailwheel-equipped airplane with a direct crosswind that was 15 knots, gusting to 20 knots. As soon as the airplane\u2019s right wheel touched down, the pilot felt the airplane start to pull to the right. When he tried to correct the airplane\u2019s direction to the left, the pilot felt the wind shift and the airplane veered off the left side of the runway into an adjacent irrigation ditch. The left wing came to rest on the sloping terrain forming the ditch. The investigation showed that the right brake calipers separated from the airplane at touchdown. Examination of the right wheel revealed that the inner wheel hub flange sustained a circumferential failure that allowed the inflated tire and tube to expand and impinge upon the brake disc and caliper. The examination further showed that the tire installed on the airplane was a larger size than the standard tire size recommended by the manufacturer of the wheel assembly (29x11.0-10 instead of 8.50-10). Because of its larger-than-standard size, the tire impinged on the brake disc and caliper after the wheel hub flange failed, which resulted in the caliper\u2019s separation upon touchdown.  According to the type certificate holder for the airplane, some G-164B operators of the accident airplane model have obtained field approval from their local Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight standards district office to use the oversize tires. The FAA had issued such a field approval for the accident airplane. As a result of this accident and the subsequent investigation, on December 15, 2010, the FAA issued Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin CE-11-06, which reminded operators that oversized tire modifications require analysis and substantiation as well as periodic inspections to prevent unsafe conditions, none of which were accomplished in this case.

During climb out, both pilots noted an increasing nose high pitch attitude and pushed forward on their respective yokes in an effort to regain aircraft control.  The aircraft did not respond to control yoke inputs and the certified flight instructor (CFI) was only able to regain control by retracting the flaps and retarding the throttle; however, there was no runway remaining to affect a landing.  The CFI used engine power to maintain aircraft pitch control and setup for an off-airport landing.

The pilot of the Cessna 182A said that he was level at 1,500 feet msl on a northwesterly heading and saw a blue and white high wing airplane crossing in front of his immediate position and pitched the airplane upwards just prior to colliding with the other airplane.  After the collision, the pilot determined that his airplane was still controllable and he was able to continue flight and land at the airport he originated from.  The pilot stated that prior to the collision, he was monitoring both the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency and the tower frequency from another nearby controlled airport, and was also conducting a visual scan of the area with the intention of switching to the tower frequency for his destination airport to monitor local area traffic.  The pilot of the American Champion Aircraft 7GCBC reported he was in level cruise flight at an altitude of 1,500 feet msl on a southwesterly heading towards his destination airport when he heard a loud bang followed by a sudden loss of directional control.  The pilot stated that the airplane remained flying; however, it was in a 15-degree descending left bank despite opposite control inputs.  The pilot initiated a forced landing into the waters of a bay.  Both the pilot and passenger exited the airplane as it started to sink.  Prior to the airplane sinking; the pilot noticed that the vertical stabilizer was missing.  The pilot added that prior to the collision, he had established contact with the tower controller at his destination airport.

No mechanical anomalies were noted during the preflight.  The certificated flight instructor (CFI) and student departed to do training at another airport.  During takeoff to return to their home base, the CFI heard a clicking noise coming from the helicopter and decided to make a precautionary landing; however, the helicopter began a roll to the right.  The CFI attempted to correct the roll to the right with the application of left cyclic, but there was no corresponding response.  The right skid contacted the ground and the helicopter rolled over, coming to rest on its left side.  Following the accident, the bolt, nut, and two spacers that connected the left cyclic push-pull tube to the swashplate were located on the runway.  When the Federal Aviation Administration inspector arrived, he also walked the accident area and found the self-locking nut.  A review of the aircraft logbook indicated that the left rib at the top of the mast fairing had been installed at the last 100-hour inspection, 2.5 hours before the accident.  In order to remove the left rib (bulkhead), the bolt and nut assembly that attaches the left cyclic push-pull tube to the left lug of the non-rotating swashplate had to be disassembled, and then reassembled after the rib (bulkhead) replacement.  According to the manufacturer's Illustrated Parts Catalog, left cyclic push-pull tube connection to the non-rotating swashplate assembly requires a bolt and self-locking nut, 3 spacers (2 of the 3 spacers were found at the accident site), a washer, and a locking palnut, were not found.  A metallurgical examination of the swashplate assembly, left push-pull tube, left rib (bulkhead), nut and bolt and associated hardware was conducted.  All of the fracture surfaces examined revealed no preexisting damage.  The absence of the bolt between the left cyclic push-pull tube and the non-rotating swashplate after the accident and the thread imprints within the hole of the left lug of the non-rotating swashplate indicated that the bolt had been backing out of the hole over time.  The bolt and nut that were recovered were in good condition, and the hole in the left lug of the non-rotating swashplate was not significantly ovalized, indicating that the bolted connection was not subjected to excessive loads of any kind.  The loss of the nut (and subsequent backing out of the bolt) indicates that the connection was not properly assembled following the recent maintenance, which required the bolted connection to be disassembled.",

He spent a total of 13 hours on the ground in Kentucky before departing early in the morning on the day of the accident. The first leg was 5 hours followed by a fuel stop. The next leg was 3 hours 20 minutes, and another fuel stop was made. The pilot then departed on the accident leg to his destination in California. \u000b\u000bThe pilot flew the over 4-hour accident leg under visual flight rules using air traffic control flight following services. He flew directly between waypoints instead of on established airways. The airplane was equipped with a panel-mounted GPS unit with altitude information capability, and the pilot\u2019s iPad was equipped with current flight planning and guidance software, and electronic navigation charts. The pilot had access to sufficient information in flight to remain clear of terrain, but the investigation was unable to determine whether the pilot accessed that information during any part of that flight leg. \u000b\u000bWhen the airplane was about 65 miles from its destination, the pilot began a steady descent from his cruise altitude of 12,500 feet, which he had flown without supplemental oxygen. The destination elevation was 230 feet. \u000b\u000bDue to coverage limitations, radar contact with the airplane was lost when it was descending through 5,100 feet. At this point, the airplane was 46 miles from its destination, and the controller cancelled the flight-following services. There were no further communications from the pilot; up to this point, he had acknowledged all transmissions from ATC. Twelve miles after flight-following services were cancelled, the airplane impacted a hillside at an elevation of about 1,960 feet. Ground scar and wreckage information indicated that the airplane impacted in a wings-level attitude on a near-horizontal flight path. The airplane was highly fragmented and damaged by postimpact fire. Evidence was consistent with the landing gear and flaps retracted. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. \u000b\u000bDarkness prevailed at the time of the accident, and AIRMETs for mountain obscuration were current for the time and location of the accident. Satellite and weather radar data suggested the presence of instrument meteorological conditions along parts of the airplane\u2019s route, but the investigation was unable to determine whether the pilot encountered or entered instrument meteorological conditions during the descent.\u000b\u000bExtrapolation of radar-derived speed and descent rate data indicated that the airplane descended steadily on track from cruise to the impact point. The pilot\u2019s autopsy indicated that the cause of death was multiple blunt trauma injuries, with no adverse pre-existing conditions. The effects of possible fatigue or hypoxia on the pilot\u2019s performance could not be determined.\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s lack of situational awareness regarding the surrounding terrain while descending during dark night conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain. "

The airport was at an elevation of 4,780 feet mean sea level (msl) and the density altitude was 6,692 feet msl.  During his leaning of the mixture, the pilot set the rpm at 1,800, leaned the mixture for an increase in rpm, then richened the mixture by one full turn, all in accordance with instructions given him during his check-out in the rental airplane by a flight instructor.  The pilot completed his pre-takeoff checklist, made a traffic advisory, and positioned the airplane for takeoff.  He held the brakes and applied full throttle.  As the rpm came up to 2,600 rpm, the engine sounded normal, the brakes were released, and he began the takeoff roll.  During the takeoff ground roll, a significantly greater distance was required to develop airspeed than the pilot expected; however, he thought this to be the result of the airport elevation and the outside air temperature.  The pilot operating handbook (POH) performance charts showed that a ground roll of 2,100 feet should have been required to achieve takeoff over a 50-foot obstacle. The airplane reached 65 knots approximately 2/3 down the 5,929-foot-long runway and slight elevator back pressure was applied.  The airplane lifted off and back pressure was eased to remain in ground effect and continue airspeed acceleration.  However, the airplane did not accelerate, but instead settled back to the ground.  The airplane touched down just off the end of the runway and came to a stop approximately 20 feet from the airport perimeter fence.  The day prior to the accident, the pilot was checked out in the airplane.  Following the check-out flight, he asked the certified flight instructor (CFI) the proper leaning procedures for the airplane.  He was told to lean the mixture at run-up (1,800 rpm) using engine rpm, and then richen it one full turn at field elevations below 5,000 feet msl, and to lean the mixture at full power using the exhaust gas temperature gauge at field elevations above 5,000 feet msl.  The POH states that the engine should be leaned using 2,600 rpm using the combined manifold and fuel flow indicator gauge.  This gauge shows fuel flow in gallons per hour and is marked with a green arc to indicate normal fuel flow operating parameters for different power settings.  The takeoff optimum fuel performance range is covered by green sectors and the high side of each green sector represents the appropriate fuel setting required to obtain maximum power when operating at full throttle and 2,600 rpm.  A Federal Aviation Administration inspector test-ran the engine following the accident and no operational anomalies were noted.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to lean the mixture in accordance with the pilot operating handbook specified procedures, which resulted in a power deficiency, a degraded climb capability, and the inability to attain/maintain an adequate airspeed that led to a stall/mush condition while departing in high density altitude conditions.  The pilot's failure to abort the takeoff when an excessive takeoff ground roll became apparent was also causal.   Also causal, was the certified flight instructor's failure to provide the proper leaning procedures during a preflight briefing."

Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local area personal flight that departed about 0800.The pilot reported that during the accident flight he had successfully completed 6 landings at several airports before he decided to return to the departure airport for a final landing. He stated that the tail wheel-equipped airplane bounced upon touchdown on runway 18 (4,201 feet by 60 feet, asphalt). In an attempt to recover from the bounced landing, he maintained pitch attitude to allow the airplane to settle back to the runway. After the second touchdown, the airplane began a left swerve.

During the landing roll, the nose landing gear began producing scuff marks on the runway surface that became progressively deeper.  The nose gear strut and fork eventually dug into the runway, and the nose landing gear strut was bent aft.  The airplane nosed over, and received structural damage to the fuselage, left elevator, left wing, rudder, and vertical stabilizer.  An exam of the runway revealed surface undulations in the area where the nose wheel fork assembly began to scuff the tops of the undulations, producing slight gouge marks that increased in depth and ended where the nose fork dug into the ground.  There were no skidding signatures or evidence that the main landing wheel tires were locked before the airplane nosed over.  An exam of the airplane revealed that the nose gear strut was bent aft and upward from its normal geometry.  The nose fork assembly is comprised of a metal swiveling housing block, attached to the lower end of the threaded strut by a nut.  The bottom edge of the threaded nose fork strut is about 4 inches from the ground.  A teardrop-shaped fiberglass wheel pant enclosed the accident airplane's nose fork assembly and upper portion of the nose wheel and tire.  The distance from the bottom of the wheel pant and ground is about 2 and 7/16 inches.  Staff examined data for 18 recent accidents and one incident in which Vans Aircraft series RV-6A, RV-7A, RV-8A, or RV-9A airplanes have become inverted during landing.  Several involved hard touchdowns, bounced landings (six), or landing in a slip.   Several others involved off-field landings in rough terrain, hitting a ditch, or going down an embankment.  Four of the accidents and one incident involved a touchdown and the start of a rollout on an unpaved runway, followed by the nose gear folding back.  The airplanes would then slide for varying distances before nosing over.  Staff also examined data for four additional incidents in which the nose gear collapsed during taxi but the airplane did not nose over.   These nine accidents and incidents occurred on various unpaved surfaces including gravel, turf, soft turf, hard surface with \"washboard\" bumps, and slight depressions, and they all involved the nose gear strut and fork digging into the ground and the nose gear bending aft. The kit manufacturer posted a letter on their website stating that their review of NTSB accident reports pointed to pilot proficiency as the most significant factor.

The pilot subsequently conducted multiple ground and air taxi runs before departing toward his home heliport. About 45 minutes into the flight, when the helicopter was about 900 feet over tree-covered terrain, the engine lost power. The pilot then performed an approximately 180-degree autorotation to a curved street. The helicopter landed hard and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. Prior to the loss of engine power, the pilot did not observe any caution or warning lights, and the FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) remained in the automatic mode. The pilot also noted no unusual noises or yawing of the helicopter prior to the loss of engine power. A subsequent download of the helicopter's incident recorder revealed \"Engine Flameout,\" \"Nr Droop,\" and \"Ng Exceedance Low\" faults.

Controllers in the Air Traffic Control Tower observed the airplane liftoff and begin a turn to the right at midfield, though they thought that the altitude, which they estimated at 60 to 80 feet, was very low.

After a \"go-around\", the pilot attempted to set up for a shallow approach.  About 75 to 100 feet above the ground on final, the pilot felt \"turbulence\" and the airplane began descending quickly.  The airplane then impacted the ground \"pretty hard\" breaking the left landing gear, skidding about 40 feet, and coming to rest in an upright position.  Examination of the airplane after the accident revealed that the elevator control cable was found liberated from its \"Nicopress\" fitting.  The elevator cable had been replaced with a new cable by the pilot, under the supervision of a A&P; mechanic on February 8, 2001.  According to the pilot, the new elevator cable was fabricated for him by an aircraft maintenance facility.  The airplane was given an annual inspection on March 6, 2001 by the same A&P; mechanic who assisted with the elevator cable installation.  The last time the airplane flew prior to the accident was on March 8, 2001, when the pilot flew the airplane for about 35 minutes with no anomalies.",
            "probable_cause": "the loose clamp (Nicopress fitting) on the elevator control cable due to inadequate quality control during the cable's manufacturing, which allowed the cable to disconnect and restricted the pilot's control of the airplane during landing."

During final approach, the pilot noticed the airplane was going to be short of the intended landing point, so the pilot advanced the engine throttle to reestablish a proper glide path. The pilot stated the engine did not respond as he expected, so he continued to advance the throttle. The continued advancement of the engine throttle did not change the engine power output. Realizing the airplane may land short of the runway, the pilot applied maximum throttle. The engine surged and the pilot could feel the increase in power.

In February 1995, the FAA issued an Advisory Circular (AC 90-95) concerning unanticipated right yaw in helicopters, or loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE).
