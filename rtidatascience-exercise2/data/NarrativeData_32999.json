Review of video recorded by two video cameras attached to the aircraft indicated that the takeoff and departure were uneventful with no observed difficulties with the aircraft\u2019s airframe, wing, or engine. About 30 minutes into the flight, the video documented the instructor maneuvering the aircraft in the vicinity of the accident site. The video documentation stopped about 15 seconds before the accident due to data buffering time. However, witnesses observed the aircraft low over the water flying directly toward a scallop-shaped sandy beach surrounded on three sides by high rocky cliffs. The pilot was observed to fly the aircraft within 50 to 100 feet of the cliffs in a steep-bank, 180-degree turn. The witnesses said that the aircraft's bank angle increased to nearly 90 degrees, and the aircraft began to descend rapidly in a side-slip. As the aircraft completed its turn about 200 feet above ground level, and with its nose pointed steeply downward, the pilot was observed to push aggressively forward on the flight controls, and a loud \u201cpop\u201d was heard. One witness observed the right wing's fabric go slack, and the aircraft performed a complete barrel roll to the right. Moments later the aircraft impacted the ocean.   Postaccident examination of the wreckage found numerous holes torn in the wing fabric and several repair patches were identified on the fabric. Testing with a Bettsometer fabric tester determined that the fabric had deteriorated due to exposure to sunlight and that its strength was below the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for flight. A manufacturer\u2019s representative stated that the pilot had contacted him several weeks before the accident and ordered a new replacement wing, which indicates that the pilot was aware of the fabric\u2019s deteriorated condition. The maximum takeoff gross weight for the aircraft was 903 pounds.  An estimate of the aircraft's weight at takeoff indicated that it was about 121 pounds overweight. This excess weight increased the load on the aircraft\u2019s wing and likely contributed to the failure of the fabric. ",

The pilot looked out of his window toward the tail section and observed the elevator trim tab fluttering up and down with no corresponding movement to the trim wheel inside the cockpit. The pilot reduced engine power to slow the airplane and regain aircraft control. The airplane began to descend despite full aft elevator pressure. Realizing that he did not have elevator control, the pilot manually manipulated the throttle for pitch control and contacted air traffic control to report his situation. During the descent to a road, the left wing struck a heavy advertising sign and a fence post. After exiting the airplane, the pilot inspected the trim tab and stated that it had failed outboard of the trim cable control horn bracket attachment. He also reported that the upper bolt for the elevator control cable bellcrank to the elevator torque tube attachment bracket was missing. Further examination of the airframe revealed that bolts from the upper attachment and the aft attachment for the elevator control cable bellcrank to elevator torque tube attachment were missing. Damage to the airframe in the tail section included, on the right side torque tube, rub marks on the leading edge with corresponding damage to the adjacent airframe skin, and left side torque tube rub marks on the trailing edge with damage to the rudder skin behind it. What likely occurred was that the elevator attachment bolts on the elevator control cable bellcrank backed out, which then initiated flutter at the elevator, which transferred to the trim tab causing it to fail in overload. Maintenance records indicated that the applicable Airworthiness Directive for the inspection of the trim tab horn attachment was accomplished in December 1949. The airplane had flown 7 hours since its last annual inspection 6 months prior to the accident.",

            "narrative": "On May 30, 2015, about 1130 Alaska daylight time, a Cessna 207, N1653U, sustained substantial damage after impacting trees about 40 miles southeast of Bethel, Alaska. The airplane was being operated by Yute Air, Bethel, Alaska as a visual flight rules (VFR) postmaintenance flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The commercial pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. Visual meteorological conditions were reported in the area of the accident, and company flight following procedures were in effect. The accident flight originated at the Bethel Airport, Alaska about 0830, with an expected return time of 1200.About 1415, flight coordination personnel from Yute Air in Bethel notified the Director of Operations (DO) that the accident airplane was overdue. About 1435 the DO notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) who issued an alert notice (ALNOT).  About 1532, an aerial search was initiated by Yute Air, Alaska State Troopers, Alaska Air National Guard as well as other air operators and Good Samaritans. On May 31, about 1730 searchers discovered the airplane's submerged and fragmented wreckage in a river slough.  On June 1, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), along with an additional NTSB investigator, an inspector from the Anchorage Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), and members of the Alaska State Troopers, traveled to the accident scene by helicopter and river boats. The main wreckage was located submerged in a fast flowing braided river that was surrounded by trees. An area believed to be the initial impact point was marked by a broken treetop, atop about a 30 foot tall birch tree. From the initial impact point the airplane traveled northbound, about 350 feet, coming to rest on its left side, and in the fast moving river water. The engine separated from the airplane and it was located submerged upstream and in the main river channel. The pilot's body was discovered still restrained within the submerged fuselage. An on-scene documentation of the debris field was completed, and a detailed wreckage examination is pending following recovery of the airplane. The accident airplane was equipped with automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) technology. In typical applications, the ADS-B capable aircraft uses an ordinary Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to derive its precise position from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellation, and then combines that position with any number of aircraft parameters, such as speed, heading, altitude, and aircraft registration number. This information is then simultaneously broadcast to other ADS-B capable aircraft, and to ADS-B ground, or satellite communications transceivers, which then relay the aircraft's position and additional information to Air Traffic Control centers in real time.A preliminary NTSB review of ADS-B data archived by the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) showed that the accident airplane was transmitting data for portions of the accident flight. At the last recorded ADS-B position, which was about 6 miles southwest from the accident site, the airplane was flying at an altitude of approximately 475 feet mean seal level (msl), while traveling in an easterly-northeasterly direction. A detailed NTSB analysis of the archived ADS-B data is pending.The airplane was equipped with a Continental Motors IO-520 engine. A detailed NTSB examination of the engine is pending.The closest weather reporting facility was Bethel, about 40 miles northwest of the accident site. At 1053, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) was reporting, in part: Wind 210 degrees at 10 knots; visibility, 10 statute miles; clouds and sky condition, few at 12000 feet, scattered at 2000 feet; temperature, 16 degrees C; dew point, 9 degrees C; altimeter, 30.12 inHG.",

He said there were no problems associated with the airplane\u2019s controls. His last landing was a simulated engine out, and he utilized a lot of nose-up trim to maintain the best angle of glide. He said he does not routinely return the trim to neutral after a flight.An inspection of the airplane showed the trim was set close to the full nose-up position.

Information retrieved from the airplane's remote data module, a crash-hardened unit installed in the tail of the airplane intended to record flight, engine and autopilot parameters, indicated that the airplane accelerated and lifted off runway 2 normally. The airplane then made a slight right turn for about 35 seconds, which transitioned to a left turn. Approximately 9 seconds later, the roll attitude reached 46 degrees left wing down, and the airplane reached its maximum altitude of 1,241 feet mean sea level, about 575 feet above ground level. Over the next 20 seconds, the turn continued at about the same roll attitude (40-50 degrees left wing down), as the speed increased to 158 knots. Shortly thereafter, the airplane's pitch attitude began to decrease toward a peak of 10 degrees nose down, and the roll attitude began a sharp change toward the right, reaching about 70 degrees right wing down, by the end of the recorded data. The last recorded data points included a heading of 165 degrees, an engine rpm of 2,687, an indicated airspeed of 184 knots, and a vertical descent rate of 2,064 feet-per-minute. The stall warning parameter indicated \u201coff\u201d (not stalled) for the duration of the flight.The airplane initially impacted the ground about 100 feet below the top of a 20-degree slope, about 150 feet from a taxiway, and 255 feet right of the extended center line of runway 20. The airplane was destroyed by fire and impact forces. Fragments of the right wing tip were located near the initial impact point. A debris path, oriented on a 160-degree heading, extended for about 400 feet. The airplane had been operated for approximately 93 hours since new. Examination of the wreckage and recorded data did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions. At the time of the accident, the pilot had accumulated about 390 hours of total flight experience, all in the same make and model as the accident airplane. It was also noted that all logged flights in the accident airplane, with the exception of a 1.4 hour flight about two months prior to the accident, included a flight instructor onboard. The pilot had a history of attention deficit disorder and depression (both previously treated with medications) and of anxiety (for which he had previously been hospitalized and for which he had been prescribed a potentially impairing medication for use \"as needed\"). None of this information had been reported to the Federal Aviation Administration. The pilot was at risk (but had not been evaluated) for obstructive sleep apnea because of his history of snoring, obesity, and high blood pressure. It is possible that the pilot was experiencing symptoms of his unreported mental conditions, that he was fatigued due to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, or that he had recently used an anti-anxiety medication at the time of the accident. While it is possible that impairment from one or more of those sources could have adversely impacted his performance during the accident sequence, the investigation was unable to determine the role that impairment may have played in the accident.",

The private pilot and one passenger are presumed to have received fatal injuries. The airplane was registered to, and operated by, the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country personal flight under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91, when the accident occurred. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed along the route of flight, and no flight plan was filed. The flight departed the McGrath Airport, McGrath, Alaska, at 2111, en route to the Birchwood Airport, Chugiak.A postaccident review of archived Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radio communication recordings revealed that at 2109, the pilot reported taxiing for departure from the McGrath Airport. At 2111, he reporting taking off from runway 16 at the McGrath Airport. No further radio communications were received from the airplane. At 2354, a 911 call was received by the Alaska State Troopers from the pilot, stating that he had just crashed in the waters of Knik Arm, and was standing on top of his airplane. He requested rescue, and stated that he was too far from shore to swim. At 0003, the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center received notification of the accident and air assets were on scene searching at 0016. The search was conducted by personnel from the Alaska Air National Guard, U.S. Air Force, Alaska State Troopers and Civil Air Patrol, with support from the U.S. Coast Guard.On August 7, about 0610, the airplane was located about 1.8 miles northwest of the Birchwood Airport. The airplane was inverted and mostly submerged under the salt water with the bottom of the fuselage, wing strut attach points, landing gear, and a portion of the propeller protruding above the water. The occupants were not located with the airplane, and the official search continued through August 8 before being suspended. The two occupants are still missing and presumed deceased.The area the airplane was located in was a portion of the Knik Arm consisting of fast moving salt water. The several rivers that terminate at the inlet are glacier fed, and visibility in the water is often less than 1 foot due to turbidity. The Knik Arm is an area with strong tidal influence, and strong currents.On August 8, about 1045, the airplane was extracted from the water by helicopter. Due to the amount of water and organic material contained within the airplane after being submerged through several tide cycles, the airframe structure could not support the additional weight. Both wings fractured at the forward spar attach points and folded aft. The fuselage fractured about 3 feet forward of the horizontal stabilizer and remained attached by the rudder and elevator control cables.A Garmin 196 handheld GPS was still mounted on the instrument panel and all cables were still attached. The unit was removed and sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, D.C. for download.The closest weather reporting facility is Birchwood Airport, Chugiak, about 2 miles southeast of the accident site. At 2336, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) from the Birchwood Airport was reporting in part: wind from 120 degrees at 3 knots; sky condition, clear; visibility, 10 statute miles; temperature 63 degrees F; dewpoint 52 degrees F; altimeter, 29.85 inHg.A detailed wreckage and engine examination is pending.

GPS data were consistent with the witness reports. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or abnormalities that would have precluded normal operation.The pilot's medical records revealed that he had hypertension and a pacemaker, and that, about 8 months before the accident, the pacemaker was upgraded to a combination pacemaker/Automatic Internal Cardiac Defibrillator (AICD). Medical records revealed that the pilot was using medications to treat hypertension, moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, and atrial fibrillation. Toxicology testing confirmed the presence of such medications in the pilot\u2019s body. Given the postmortem examination, reported medication use, and the upgrade to a pacemaker/AICD, it is likely that the pilot had experienced a serious arrhythmia and severe congestive heart failure some time before the accident. Although the exact degree of premortem cardiac dysfunction could not be determined, the presence of the AICD indicated that the pilot\u2019s doctors had identified a significantly elevated risk of sudden cardiac death. Although an AICD reduces the risk of sudden death from tachyarrhythmia, it does not reduce the risk of a sudden death from other cardiac-related causes. Federal regulations only require a valid driver's license to exercise the privileges of a sport pilot certificate in a light-sport aircraft as long as pilots are not aware of any medical condition that would make them unable to operate a light-sport aircraft safely. However, the pilot most likely did not have sufficient knowledge to accurately assess the aviation safety risks associated with his condition.

At some point, the pitot/static system began accumulating ice because the air data heat system had not been activated or was not functioning. The condition first manifested itself as a \"RUDDER LIMIT FAULT\" warning due to icing of the rudder limiting system pitot tube. The icing continued to accumulate on the other probes of the air data system, degrading its ability to reliably determine the airplane's airspeed. About 19,000 feet, the flight crew disengaged the autopilot and pushed the pitch control column forward, and the airplane entered a descent. The flight crew initially applied uncoordinated control inputs, in the process reaching nearly 100 pounds of differential force on the pitch control column, while attempting to recover the airplane. During this period, airplane's pitch continued to oscillate through 5 cycles, for duration of 8 minutes, reaching altitudes as low as 10,600 feet and as high as 23,300 feet. During the oscillations the airplane's indicated airspeed varied greatly, between 54 and 460 knots; however, the airplane systems tests and aircraft performance data show that the recorded, as well as the displayed, airspeed indications were adversely affected by the icing conditions. Once regaining control of the airplane, the crew diverted and made an uneventful landing. Post-incident testing of the airplane's mechanical and electronic systems revealed no abnormalities that would have accounted for the unreliable airspeed indications or the loss of control reported by the flight crew. Post-incident computer modeling also confirmed that the airplane performed in a manner consistent with all deviations from normal flight having been initiated or exacerbated by the control inputs of the flight crew. Review of flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, and flight crew interviews revealed that the flight crew's actions during the event were in part contradictory with operator's training and operational procedures. Specifically, the crew initially failed to properly identify and respond to the erroneous airspeed indications that were presented and failed to coordinate their recovery of the airplane to controlled flight.",

The pilot reported that he picked up into a 4 to 6-foot hover and initiated a right pedal turn.  He stated that as the helicopter reached a west heading \"the aircraft would not turn any more\" despite his continued application of right pedal.  He stated:  \"As I continued to apply right pedal the aircraft then went into [a] sudden and uncommanded yaw to the left.  I was unable to stop the yaw.\"  The helicopter subsequently impacted the helipad and roof structure.  It came to rest at the east edge of the helipad oriented on a southeast heading.  A post accident inspection revealed that the Fenestron (tail rotor) drive shaft had failed approximately 6 inches aft of the main gearbox.  The failure occurred at the point where the drive shaft entered a tunnel formed by the left and right engine firewalls.  The firewalls and drive shaft segments in the vicinity of the point of failure exhibited scrape marks.  Examination of the forward section of the drive shaft revealed features characteristic of an overload failure.  The main gearbox output shaft assembly and rear transmission coupling connected the tail rotor drive shaft to the gearbox.  Further examination revealed that the coupling flange could be moved laterally relative to the pinion approximately 3/32 (0.094) inch.  Allowable lateral play in the drive flange was 1 millimeter (0.039 inch).  Disassembly of the transmission coupling determined that the nut which secured the drive flange to the output assembly pinion gear was improperly installed.  Wear patterns indicated that the locking tangs on the cup washer did not engage the corresponding slots on the shaft allowing the nut to loosen over time.  In addition, the condition of the locking tangs indicated that they were folded over during installation causing them to separate from the cup.  The resulting wear had removed material to such an extent that the contact face was no longer perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the shaft.  This allowed excessive radial play in the transmission coupling, which permitted contact between the tail rotor drive shaft and the firewalls.  The FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21, provided information related to failure of the anti-torque system on a helicopter.  The handbook stated:  \"The loss of antitorque normally results in an immediate yawing of the helicopter's nose.  The helicopter yaws to the right in a counter-clockwise rotor system and to the left in a clockwise system. . . . The severity of the yaw is proportionate to the amount of power being used and the airspeed.  An antitorque failure with a high power setting at a low airspeed results in a severe yawing.\"  The main rotor system of the accident helicopter rotated clockwise as viewed from above.",

The crew then read through the \"Red Gear Light Remains On (After Gear Extension)\" emergency/abnormal procedure from the cockpit operations manual to troubleshoot the problem.  Although the checklist twice presented in boldface type that five lights must be present for the gear to be considered down and locked, the crew did not verbalize the phrase either time.

The airplane subsequently touched down about one-third down the length of the runway. The pilot then increased engine power to full, and the airplane began to climb. As the airplane climbed, the pilot noted that the climb rate seemed to be slower than it was previously even though the engine appeared to be operating normally.

About 30 minutes after departure he began to experience stomach cramps. He landed the helicopter in a level meadow on the slopes of a mountain, at an altitude close to the helicopter's maximum Hover Out of Ground Effect altitude ceiling. The pilot left the engine running, locked the flight controls, and instructed the passenger to hold the controls steady. He departed the helicopter, reentered, confirmed all systems were in order, and lifted it to a low hover. Cognizant of the helicopter's performance limitations at altitude, he departed toward descending terrain. During the initial low-altitude takeoff phase, and prior to reaching translational lift, the pilot observed an auxiliary fuel pump warning light. He elected to discontinue the departure and land. During the landing, the skid made contact with the ground and vegetation and the helicopter experienced a dynamic rollover. The pilot did not recall a change in engine tone after receiving the warning, but did recollect a loss of rotor speed indication prior to impact. During the rollover sequence, the occupants were engulfed in fuel, which then ignited causing serious injury to both. The helicopter remnants, ground scars, and the pilot's recollection of the accident sequence indicated relatively low impact forces during the accident. Arcing signatures on an electrical wire located next to both fuel tanks could indicate a potential ignition source for the fuel; however, thermal damage to the helicopter structure, and the location of the fuel tanks above the engine compartment, precluded a definitive confirmation of the ignition source. The helicopter's manufacturer had issued a service letter recommending installation of fuel tank bladders in an effort to reduce the likelihood of a postaccident fuel leak. This service letter had not been complied with; however, compliance was not required per Federal Aviation Administration regulations.The engine and fuel system sustained considerable thermal damage, and as such a complete examination was not possible. Examination of the engine and fuel system remnants did not result in any findings that would have indicated a loss of engine power or the observed auxiliary fuel pump warning. The helicopter's manufacturer issued a safety alert recommending restricting high-temperature and high-altitude operations due to the potential for development of fuel vapor within the fuel system. While illumination of the auxiliary fuel pump warning was an indication of the possible formation of fuel vapor, the investigation was unable to conclusively determine the reason for the auxiliary fuel pump warning.",

The pilot applied full engine power to begin the takeoff roll, and he said that the engine rpm gauge indicated 1,850 rpm, which is a normal indication.

The solo student pilot departed the airport and proceeded to climb towards a designated practice area.  Upon reaching 4,500 feet the pilot reduced power and entered a 500-foot-per-minute descent.  At this point the pilot may have been alerted by the on-board TCAS (traffic/collision alerting device) that there was traffic approaching from her right side, close to her altitude.  The sun was also off her right side at an elevation of 31 degrees above the horizon.  Within seconds an F-16 fighter jet crossed in front of her from right to left.  The closest point of approach between the two aircraft, as determined by a radar data study, was 1,850 feet laterally and 400 feet vertically.  A study of the wake and vortex turbulence that would have been produced by the F-16 determined that the generated vortices could not have dropped low enough to affect the path of the student's airplane.  After the F-16 passed, the student's airplane continued an increasingly steep linear descent, eventually exceeding 2,500 feet per minute before impacting the terrain at a 50-degree nose down, right wing down attitude, 29 seconds after the encounter.

The terminal approach controller in contact with the 525 stated he did not observe the primary target of the 172, and conflict alert software was not installed. The 172 did not display a transponder signal and the transponder switch was subsequently found in the 'off' position. A cockpit visibility study indicated that from a fixed eye position the 172 was essentially hidden behind aircraft structure of the 525 for the 125 seconds before impact. The 172 could be seen by shifting the pilot's eye position. The 525 was viewable in the left lower section of the 172's windscreen. Both airplanes were operating in visual flight conditions. ",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of both pilots to see and avoid conflicting traffic, and the failure of the 172 pilot to operate the transponder as required by current regulations. Factors were the controller's failure to observe the traffic conflict, the lack of radar conflict alert capability, and the training emphasis on maximum autopilot usage with the autopilot controller placed at the rear of the cockpit center mounted pedestal.

Radar track data showed that the pilot initially turned the wrong direction and ultimately made several course reversals that were not in accordance with the published approach procedure. Radar data also indicated that the pilot had difficulty maintaining an altitude appropriate for the segment of the approach; the airplane's altitude increased and decreased in excess of 500 feet. In addition, on several instances, the pilot allowed the airplane to descend below the prescribed minimum altitudes for the approach. The airplane eventually impacted a river in an uncontrolled descent about \u00bd mile north of the final approach fix.

The airplane then entered a 360-degree turn to the left, east of the centerline and at an altitude far below what would be expected for a nominal flightpath and intentional maneuvering flight given the airplane's distance from the airport, which was about 5 miles.As the airplane was in its sustained left turn tracking away from the airport, the controller queried the pilot, who stated that he had a \"control problem\" and subsequently stated he had a \"left engine shutdown.\" This was the last communication received from the pilot. Witnesses saw the airplane spiral toward the ground and disappear from view.Examination of the wreckage revealed that the landing gear was in the extended position, the flaps were extended 20 degrees, and the left engine propeller blades were in the feathered position. Examination of the left engine showed the fuel shutoff valve was in the closed position, consistent with the engine being in an inoperative condition. As examined, the airplane was not configured in accordance with the airplane flight manual engine shutdown and single-engine landing procedures, which state that the airplane should remain in a clean configuration with flaps set to 5 degrees at the beginning of the final approach descent and the landing gear retracted until landing is assured. Thermal damage to the cockpit instrumentation precluded determining the preimpact position of fuel control and engine switches. The investigation found that the airplane was properly certified, equipped, and maintained in accordance with federal regulations and that the recovered airplane components showed no evidence of any preimpact structural, engine, or system failures. The investigation also determined that the pilot was properly certificated and qualified in accordance with applicable federal regulations, including Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 108, which is required for MU-2B pilots and adequate for the operation of MU-2B series airplanes. The pilot had recently completed the SFAR No. 108 training in Kansas and was returning to Tulsa. At the time of the accident, he had about 12 hours total time in the airplane make and model, and the flight was the first time he operated the airplane as a solo pilot. The investigation found no evidence indicating any preexisting medical or behavioral conditions that might have adversely affected the pilot's performance on the day of the accident.Based on aircraft performance calculations, the airplane should have been flyable in a one-engine-inoperative condition; the day visual meteorological conditions at the time of the accident do not support a loss of control due to spatial disorientation. Therefore, the available evidence indicates that the pilot did not appropriately manage a one-engine-inoperative condition, leading to a loss of control from which he did not recover.The airplane was not equipped, and was not required to be equipped, with any type of crash-resistant recorder. Although radar data and air traffic control voice communications were available during the investigation to determine the airplane's altitude and flightpath and estimate its motions (pitch, bank, yaw attitudes), the exact movements and trim state of the airplane are unknown, and other details of the airplane's performance (such as power settings) can only be estimated. In addition, because the airplane was not equipped with any type of recording device, the pilot's control and system inputs and other actions are unknown. The lack of available data significantly increased the difficulty of determining the specific causes that led to this accident, and it was not possible to determine the reasons for the left engine shutdown or evaluate the pilot's recognition of and response to an engine problem. Recorded video images from the accident flight would possibly have shown where the pilot's attention was directed during the reported problems, his interaction with the airplane controls and systems, and the status of many cockpit switches and instruments. Recorded flight data would have provided information about the engines' operating parameters and the airplane's motions. Previous NTSB recommendations have addressed the need for recording information on airplane types such as the one involved in this accident. Recorders can help investigators identify safety issues that might otherwise be undetectable, which is critical to the prevention of future accidents.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's loss of airplane control during a known one-engine-inoperative condition. The reasons for the loss of control and engine shutdown could not be determined because the airplane was not equipped with a crash-resistant recorder and postaccident examination and testing did not reveal evidence of any malfunction that would have precluded normal operation."

The pilot then noticed that the right main landing gear (MLG) was not down and locked in position for landing. The flight crew made multiple attempts to get a down-and-locked indication without success, so the pilot decided to abort the landing and divert to another airport with longer runways. After executing the manual gear extension checklist, the flight crew made a low pass at the diversion airport, and the air traffic controller in the control tower advised that the landing gear appeared to be in the down position. During the landing, the touchdown was normal, and the airplane slowed normally; however, as the airplane exited the runway, the right MLG collapsed. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the right wing, right nacelle, and right wheel well had received substantial damage and that the right MLG, after collapsing, had punctured the right nacelle fuel tank.The right MLG bearing actuator support bracket was made of aluminum. Examination of the right MLG revealed that the right MLG bearing actuator support bracket was broken and had separated from its mounting position. Multiple cracks in the bracket were visible, and, at the microscopic level, the cracks had shiny surfaces indicative of abrasion, and overload regions with a cloudy appearance. Essentially, with each cycle, whether it was with extension of the landing gear, retraction of the landing gear, or landing itself, the cracks were subjected to loading which caused them to continue to propagate until the entire assembly reached a point at which structural integrity was no longer present to hold the landing gear actuator. In December 2003, the airplane manufacturer issued a mandatory service bulletin to replace the right and left aluminum MLG bearing actuator support brackets with steel brackets and specified that the replacement of the brackets be accomplished \"as soon as possible,\" but \"no later than the next scheduled inspection, the next 200 flight hours or 24 months.\" The airplane manufacturer also requested that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issue an Airworthiness Directive (AD) based on the service bulletin. However, the FAA did not find an \"unsafe condition\" and did not issue an AD, which would have made compliance with the service bulleting mandatory.Review of the airplane's maintenance records confirmed that the airplane owner and the operator had not had the new steel brackets installed.

The engine had accumulated a total of about 3 flight hours before the accident flight, and the fuel quantity gauges were not yet operative. About 45 minutes into the flight, the engine experienced a complete loss of power during a reduced-power descent toward the home airport, and the pilot was unable to restart the engine. In the resulting off-airport forced landing, the airplane came to rest inverted. First responders observed that fuel was leaking from the tanks. Examination of the airplane and the ground underneath the airplane a few hours after the accident revealed only trace amounts of fuel. Residual fuel from the source used to fuel the airplane for the accident flight tested negative for both water and ethanol, and the fuel strainers were free of obstructions. About 1 month after the accident, the chief engine designer at the engine modification company examined and prepared the engine for a test run.

The pilot and one passenger were seriously injured and the other two passengers sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to PPG Properties, LLC; and was operated Integrity Home Care, Inc.; both of Springfield, Missouri. Night low visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 business flight. The airplane had departed Lee's Summit Municipal Airport (LXT), Lee's Summit, Missouri, about 1620 and was destined for 3DW.The airplane had descended on an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Springfield-Branson National Airport (SGF), Springfield, Missouri. After reaching VMC the pilot cancelled the IFR flight plan and advised he was proceeding direct to 3DW. Witnesses about 2 miles southwest from 3DW saw the northeast bound airplane impact the top of a 367 foot tall tower and continue flying northeast. Other witnesses about one mile from the tower saw the airplane impact trees and terrain. The witnesses immediately called 9-1-1 emergency. An examination of the airplane wreckage showed the tips of all three propeller blades were missing and there was impact damage on the left wing that breached the left wing fuel tank and penetrated from the leading edge all the way through to the front side of the spar of the left wing. An examination of the tower showed the 17 foot tall lightning rod and mast were separated and impact damaged. The tips of all three propeller blades and the separated portion of the left flap were found on the ground near the base of the tower, and parts of the lightning rod and mast were found wedged in the top of the tower structure. Police officers that responded that evening to the tower location after the accident reported that the white strobe light on the top of the tower was still operating.At 1652 the automated weather observing system at SGF, located about 5 miles northwest from the accident location, reported wind from 180 degrees at 6 knots, visibility of 10 miles, overcast clouds at 1,800 feet, temperature 11 degrees Celsius (C), dew point 7 degrees C, with an altimeter setting of 30.26 inches of Mercury.
