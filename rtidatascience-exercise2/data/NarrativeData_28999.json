            "narrative": "On April 14, 2015, about 1330 Alaska daylight time, a wheel-equipped Cessna 180 airplane, N9247C, is presumed to have sustained substantial damage during impact with ocean waters, about 18 miles east of Whittier, Alaska, following a reported loss of engine power. The airplane was being operated as an instrument flight rules (IFR) cross-country personal flight under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91, when the accident occurred. The instrument rated private pilot, the sole occupant of the airplane, sustained fatal injuries. Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed along the route of flight, and the airplane was operating on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight departed the Wasilla Airport, Wasilla, Alaska, about 1205, en route to the Valdez Airport, Valdez, Alaska. A postaccident review of archived Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar data and radio communication recordings revealed that, about 1315, the on-duty Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) radar controller cleared the airplane for the LDA/DME H instrument approach to the Valdez Airport. At that time, the airplane was about 60 miles southwest of the Valdez Airport, at an altitude of about 10,000 feet mean sea level (msl). Shortly after the pilot began a descent from 10,000 feet msl, he advised the ARTCC controller of an engine problem. The pilot stated his intentions to descend below a cloud layer and land on a nearby island. Shortly after, radar contact with the airplane was lost. A radio communication from the accident airplane was relayed through another airplane in the area that he was at 5,500 feet msl, and still in the clouds. No further radio transmissions were received from the airplane and an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal was broadcasting shortly thereafter for approximately 20 seconds. The area that the airplane descended into was a portion of the Prince William Sound, consisting of remote inland fjords, coastal waterways, and steep mountainous terrain. The airplane was equipped with a Spidertracks flight tracking system, which provides real-time aircraft flight tracking data. The flight tracking information is transmitted via Iridium satellites to an internet based storage location, at two minute intervals. The airplane's last known location was near the eastern shoreline of Culross Island, at an altitude of 69 feet, traveling at 80 knots, on a heading of about 270 degrees. An alert notice was issued by the FAA Kenai Flight Service Station at 1336 and a search was conducted by personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard, Alaska State Troopers and Alaska Air National Guard, as well as a Good Samaritan vessel. On April 15, about 1700, searchers discovered the remains of the pilot along the eastern shoreline of Culross Island. Also recovered was the left main landing gear strut and tire belonging to the accident airplane. The rest of the airplane has not yet been located, and it is presumed to have sunk in the ocean waters of Prince William Sound.The closest weather reporting facility is Valdez Airport, Valdez, Alaska, about 60 miles northeast of the accident site. At 1256, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) from the Valdez Airport was reporting in part: Wind, calm; sky condition, few clouds at 6,000 feet AGL, broken at 7,500 feet AGL, overcast at 9,000 feet AGL; visibility, 10 statute miles; temperature 37 degrees F; dewpoint 14 degrees F; altimeter, 29.64 inHg.

The student pilot/owner operated the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. The pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall, fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer.

While on climb out, at 3,300 feet, the pilot reduced the engine power setting; at that point the airplane was climbing about 1,500 feet per minute. Shortly thereafter, about 3,700 feet, the pilot reported that he didn\u2019t feel any \u201cpull\u201d from the airplane.

While in cruise flight, the FAA designated pilot examiner (DPE) initiated a simulated engine failure to the pilot.  Neither pilot monitored the engine RPM, and neither noticed that the engine stopped producing power after the DPE reduced the throttle.  As a result, the rotor RPM decayed during the attempted powered recovery, the glide distance was reduced, and adequate rotor RPM for cushion at touchdown was not available.  The pilot was asked if there were any specific checks or callouts he was to perform in the event of a simulated engine failure.  He said that he did not have any required callouts, did not verbalize his intended point of touchdown, or crosscheck the engine RPM until he attempted a powered recovery from the autorotation.  The examiner was asked if the applicant was required to check any parameters or make any callouts during his response to the simulated emergency.

Because his flight control inputs did not result in recovery from the spin after three and one-half turns, he deployed the spin recovery/stabilization drogue parachute. Once the aircraft was established in an attitude from which the pilot could maintain controlled flight once the parachute was released, he pulled the drogue chute manual jettison handle. At that point, because the chute did not release, the pilot activated the electrical backup jettison system. When that action did not release the parachute, the pilot tried the electrical system a second time, and finding that this action did not release the chute, he tried the manual release a second time. At that point, because the parachute still remained attached, the pilot applied engine power in an attempt to establish controlled flight with the parachute in trail. Once he determined that the aircraft could not be satisfactorily flown in that configuration, he exited the aircraft and deployed his emergency parachute. During the investigation it was determined that the drogue chute either became entangled in the drogue chute tail boom after release from the tow hook mechanism, or it did not release from the tow hook mechanism when the pilot tried to activate it, but instead was released by the forces created by the impact with the terrain.

The flight departed from runway 07, and remained in the traffic pattern.  When the flight was approximately three quarters down the runway on the downwind leg, witnesses heard the engine sputter and experience a loss of power.  The airplane was observed to continue on the downwind leg; several witnesses reported that they perceived the flight path to be similar to a normal traffic pattern rather than turning toward the runway.  The airplane became low on final approach and went out sight behind trees.  The airplane impacted a tree then the ground, and came to rest upright approximately a quarter nautical mile from the approach end of runway 07.  The fuel selector was found positioned to near the \"right\" tank position;  impact damage to the selector valve attach structure was noted though no fuel stains in the area was noted.  The right fuel tank was found to contain approximately 20 ounces of fuel.  The left wing remained secured only by the aileron control cables but remained in close proximity to the fuselage; the fuel tank contained approximately 13 gallons of fuel.  No obstructions of the fuel vent or delivery system were noted.  The fuel line from the right fuel tank was routed to the forward side of the fuel selector valve, and the fuel line from the left fuel tank was routed to the aft side of the fuel selector valve.  Only drops of fuel were noted in the fuel lines in the engine compartment area; no obstructions of the fuel delivery or vent systems were noted.  The engine was removed from the airplane, a replacement propeller was installed, and the engine was started and operated to 2,250 rpm with no discrepancies noted.  The airplane was previously involved in a partial collapse of the nose landing gear and propeller strike while landing at an airport in California; the airplane was sold to an airplane salvage company who had the wings removed.  The airplane was transported to their facility, then transported and sold to the accident pilot.  A mechanic performing repairs and the last annual inspection to the airplane reported the aluminum fuel lines located in the cockpit aft of the fuel selector valve were damaged to the point that he could not determine routing of the lines.  Based on his perception of the illustration in the Piper Parts Catalog, and also on his belief that the fuel selector handle pointed to the forward port of the fuel selector valve when the right fuel tank was selected, he routed and connected the fuel line from the right fuel tank to the forward side of the fuel selector valve, and the fuel line from the left fuel tank to the aft side of the selector valve.  On the first page of the Introduction Section of the PA-28 parts catalog, there is a note, in bold letters, which states, \"UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THIS CATALOG BE USED FOR RIGGING AND INSTALLATION PURPOSES.\" The parts catalog indicates that the fuel line from the right fuel tank should be routed to the aft side of the fuel selector valve, and the fuel line from the left fuel tank should be routed to the forward side of the fuel selector valve.  The illustration of the parts catalog was difficult to ascertain the routing of fuel lines from the fuel selector valve to the tanks, but the index clearly indicated the routing.  Following the repairs, fuel was added to the tanks, he checked for fuel leaks, and verified engine operation.  He also test flew the airplane, and flew with the pilot a short duration.  The accident pilot reportedly flew the airplane 3 or 4 times after the inspection was completed, and the airplane was also flown by a friend of the pilot a day earlier.  The pilot reported before departure, the right fuel tank had 5-6 gallons and the left fuel tank had approximately 15 gallons of fuel.  The flight duration was approximately 30 minutes and was flown with the fuel selector positioned to the left tank position; the selector was not moved during the flight.  He did not visually inspect the tanks after landing but reported the left fuel gauge indicated approximately 10 gallons of fuel after landing; he did not note the right fuel gauge reading after landing.  The owners handbook indicates that the fuel selector is to be on the proper tank for takeoff, and in the event of a loss of engine power, to position the fuel selector to the opposite tank.",

The carburetor was overhauled about 11 hours prior to the accident.  During post overhaul flights an intermittent carburetor rich fuel/air mixture was noted in the idle circuit, which prevented the engine from idling below about 1100 rpm without fouling and quitting from excessive fuel.  The carburetor was removed and sent back to the overhaul shop who removed the installed needle valve assembly and replaced it with another identical new assembly.  The carburetor was then installed on the engine.  When the main fuel shutoff valve was turned on, fuel began to run out of the carburetor.  It was again removed and returned to the overhaul shop.  The shop owner suspected that a stuck or hanging up float may have been also been the problem.  Since the carburetor was equipped with an Advanced Polymer float, which is larger than either the original brass or older style composite float, the shop owner carefully adjusted the float for lateral clearance between the float and the bowl wall, and, between the float clip and the needle valve.   After several attempts on the test bench to achieve a stabilized fuel level, the carburetor finally passed.  The pilot (an A&P;) picked up the carburetor from the shop on the day of the accident, installed it, then flew the airplane for about 15 minutes.  The accident happened on the second test flight.  Post accident examination of the engine revealed sooted spark plugs typical of a rich fuel/air mixture.  The carburetor was functionally tested by mounting it on a tilting test fixture.  A trace amount of fuel was observed leaking from the discharge nozzle.  When the fixture was rotated to a bank angle, fuel flowed freely from the nozzle.  Tapping on the bowl stopped the flowage.  Operational testing disclosed that the carburetor was operating at an excessively rich setting at idle speed.  Disassembly disclosed that the Advanced Polymer float was clean and intact with no sign of damage.  The float setting and bowl clearance was good.  The needle valve seat assembly was inspected and measured and found to meet specifications.  The float retractor clip and needle valve shoulder clearance was measured about 0.005-inch.  The pivot pin/shaft that hinges the float assembly was found to be \"tight\" in the inside diameter of the Polymer Float hinge points; however, the float and shaft combination did rotate freely in the float bracket.  The manufacturer's service manual (and incorporated overhaul instructions) were examined.  There are three types of floats which can be installed.  The originally designed floats are hollow brass chambers.  The second type, no longer in production, consists of floats constructed out of composite materials.  The third type is the Advanced Polymer floats, which are physically larger that either the brass or composite floats.  With either the brass or composite floats, a typical 0.081-inch clearance exists between the float and the bowl chamber.  The increased size of the polymer float reduces the float to bowl wall clearance to a typical 0.031 inches.  The original sections of the service manual address the original brass floats and calls for a post reassembly minimum clearance of 0.005-inch between the float valve seat shoulder and the float valve retractor clip.  Instructions E-955 (dated 03/18/99) have been incorporated into the manual and cover the installation of the polymer floats.  This document requires the assembler only to \"Insure that clearance exists between the float valve seat (shoulder) and the float valve retractor clip.\"  There is no published minimum clearance limit.  During final assembly, the carburetor fuel bowl and throttle body go together blind and without the ability to see the final internal clearances.  Float clearance and height settings are critical to the proper metering of fuel proportional to airflow through the venturi of the carburetor.  Any float drag against the wall of the bowl assembly could feasibly disturb the critical balance.  The investigation measured several sources of free play in the carburetor removed from the accident airplane with a dial indicator.  About 0.015-inch was measured rotating the bowl cover and fuel bowl halves with just snug bowl screws.  A source of horizontal float centering free play not mentioned in E-955 is in the float hinge that is attached with screws to the bowl cover; the hinge can slide about 0.028-inch from either screw.  Index marks were added by the investigator to each float tip, and the total sideways free play of the hinge measured about 0.229-inch at the float tips.  The accident float flange was coated with a bead of black transfer material to test for rubbing on the bowl walls.  The float was then reassembled into the accident carburetor bowl and throttle body assemblies following the service manual and kit instructions E-955.  The carburetor was then rotated in various positions.  Disassembly revealed black transfer markings on the inside of the bowl walls.  The arc of float travel on the hinge point can bring the Polymer float against the bowl wall when the lateral movement is adjusted while installing the float bracket.  An improperly centered float that rubs on the bowl wall may affect the float buoyancy and seating of the needle valve.  The float retractor clip attaches to the needle valve.  Without positive clearance from the needle valve seat shoulder a loss of float buoyancy or pressure to seat the valve can occur.  Without proper seating of the needle valve due to float horn to bowl contact, positive fuel shutoff would be unlikely.",
            "probable_cause": "a total loss of engine power due to an excessively rich mixture setting in the carburetor.  The overly rich operation of the carburetor was due to the overhaul shop's failure to obtain the proper clearance between the float and chamber walls, which allowed the float to rub and hang up.  The overhaul shops failure to achieve the correct clearances was due in part to the inadequacy of the manufacturer's overhaul instructions concerning installation of the Advanced Polymer Floats.  "

The instructor added that due to the low altitude, he was unable to align the airplane with the rows of dirt.  During the approach to landing, the airplane \"caught some lift\" and subsequently entered a \"strong down draft\" and impacted the ground.

About this time, two aircraft (a Cessna 152 and the other airplane involved in the collision, N6342T, a Cessna TR182) were sequentially cleared for takeoff on runway 21 for right crosswind departures.

The controller issued the inbound traffic to the 182, and the pilot and CFI responded 'negative contact.' The controller informed the 172 that the first of the departures was now in a right crosswind turn.  The 172 pilot replied that 'I'm looking.'

The autopilot was disengaged in accordance with AFM procedures to resolve the problem.  The flight crew had to maintain about 2 inches of forward pressure on the flight control column to maintain level flight.  The first officer reported that the stabilizer trim could be manually adjusted up and down, but at no point would the trim go below four units of trim.  The Horizontal Stabilizer Trim Actuator (HSTA) and Motor Control Unit (MCU) were replaced, and the airplane underwent a series of diagnostic checks and a functional flight test with no mechanical anomalies noted.  During removal of the HSTA and MCU a component was heard moving inside the HSTA.  Teardown of the HSTA revealed that the Channel 1 bell gear had separated from its four mounting tabs.  It was also noted that two of the main spur gear bolts had backed out, and were loose and out of position in the HSTA.  The other two main spur gear bolts were finger-tight, but remained in place.

Witnesses reported that the engine sound was quiet prior to impact with trees, power lines, and a house.  The airplane came to rest inverted in the backyard of a residence.  The total flight time since the last refueling of 40 gallons was 2.1 hours tachometer time.  The owner estimated that when the 40 gallons were added, the fuel tanks would have been near empty.  Fuel calculations based on charts in the Cessna Pilot's Operating Handbook indicated that approximately 30 gallons would have been used during the 2.1 hours.

There was no temperature gauge or tabular data available that could have informed the crew that heat buildup resulting from taxi distance was now at a level that potentially threatened the integrity of the tires.  During the takeoff roll, the 3F tire exploded, resulting in vibration, shudder, and yaw.  The sudden instability, combined with a phantom C1 cargo door light, caused the Captain to abort.

A review of the airframe and engine logbooks revealed that the engine recorded as installed in the airplane was not what investigators found installed on the airplane.  By serial number, the engine found on the airplane was the one that the repair facility had worked on.  Beyond the work performed by the repair facility, the history of the engine is unknown.  During the post accident engine examination, investigators noted signatures consistent with oil starvation.  The connecting rods were rust colored and the crankshaft journals were thermally damaged and blue in color, with a bronze/copper color transfer.  The forward main bearing halves were also coated with a bronze/copper coloration, and were not aligned with their respective oil galley passageways.   Since the engine repair in March 2002, the engine was estimated to have accrued 54.33 hours of total time.  According to the Federal Aviation Regulations Title 14 CFR 43.1, and 91.409, the maintenance and inspection requirements of these regulations do not apply to aircraft certificated in the experimental category.",
            "probable_cause": "a loss of engine power due to oil starvation that was the result of misaligned main bearing halves that obstructed the oil galley passages.  Since the history of the engine could not be reconstructed, the person or entity responsible for the bearing misalignment could not be determined.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed while maneuvering for a forced landing that resulted in a stall/spin."
