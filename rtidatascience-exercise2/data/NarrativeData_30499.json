He flew to another airport that was located near the perimeter of the southeast quadrant of a geographic bowl at an elevation of 4,220 ft msl. The pilot had not previously flown into or out of the destination airport and had only flown one time into and out of a high-elevation airport (about 6,700 ft msl). The flight to the destination was uneventful. Later that afternoon, the pilot performed a weight-and-balance check and obtained a weather briefing before departure for the trip home. He did not conduct any density altitude, takeoff, or climb performance calculations. The pilot reported that the takeoff roll and initial climbout were normal, but when he turned onto the left crosswind leg, the airplane no longer seemed to be climbing. The airplane struck terrain about\u00a0\u00bd mile from the departure end of the runway. The impact location elevation was about 160 ft above the departure airport elevation. Examination of the airplane, engine, and propeller did not reveal any preexisting mechanical deficiencies or problems that would have precluded normal operation.\u000b\u000bBased on the calculated density altitude of about 6,700 ft, the airplane manufacturer\u2019s performance charts indicated that the airplane would require about 3,300 ft to attain an altitude of 50 ft above ground level (agl). The expected initial climb rate was about 310 ft per minute; without any wind or performance decrements, the airplane would have been about 115 ft agl when it reached the impact location. Performance decrements included loss of lift in the turn; possible less-than-ideal airframe, engine, propeller, or pilot performance; and adverse wind, including downdrafts and the loss of the headwind component during the turn.\u000b\u000bThe departure airport was equipped with two parallel runways and no air traffic control tower. A dedicated traffic advisory radio frequency and opposite-direction traffic patterns were used to separate the airport\u2019s sailplane and powered airplane operations. In keeping with the airport\u2019s procedures, the pilot used runway 27L and attempted to fly a left traffic pattern for departure. Review of the local topography revealed that the terrain south of the airport rose relatively rapidly, while the terrain both west and north remained about the airport elevation for several miles. Had the pilot conducted predeparture climb performance calculations, he would have determined that the airplane\u2019s climb capability was significantly reduced by the high density altitude. That, in turn, should have prompted him to select a departure path that remained clear of rising terrain. Two available options included a straight-out departure from runway 27L or a right turn from either runway 27L or 27R once the pilot was assured that a right turnout would not create a traffic conflict with the sailplanes using the airport.",

Prior to the approach, the pilot overflew the intended landing location and was informed that the winds were from the west approximately 7 knots.  The pilot performed a hover check approximately 1/2 mile east of the intended landing zone (LZ) over a valley.  The pilot moved the helicopter west to the LZ at a speed just above effective translational lift and came to a hover with the load approximately 30-40 feet over the landing spot.  The pilot checked the engine and operating instruments and all systems indicated normal.  The pilot began looking down and outside the helicopter when he felt a yaw to the right.  The pilot noticed that he was \"depressing the left [pedal] more as I pushed on the left to stop a right turn.\"  The helicopter then made an \"uncommanded turn to the right and began spinning right.\"  The helicopter made two to three rotations to the right; the pilot jettisoned the cargo portion of the long line and lowered the collective.

The altimeter was installed, but had not been connected to the static port.  The line connection on the back of the altimeter was capped with a plastic plug.  The airspeed indicator was connected to the static port only.  The instrument panel cutouts were found in the pilot's hangar.  The pilot's logbook showed he had 155 hours of ultralight flight time and 42 hours of flight time in light sport airplanes.  The logbook showed he had a total of 1.5 hours of flight time in the accident airplane.  ",

While around the Laurel Lake area wearing a Telex Echelon 20 noise cancelling headset, he \"thought he heard sputter or something\", but he later indicated he was not sure if he heard it or perceived it. At that point while flying about 2,700 feet mean sea level (msl), he looked down and noted the oil temperature was indicating 235 degrees Fahrenheit, which was above the normal range. He immediately reduced power from between 5,000 and 5,200 rpm to 4,000 rpm in an attempt to cool the engine, and trimmed the airplane. Rather than fly from that location to LOZ, between which is no suitable forced landing site, he opted for a pre-emptive landing on Laurel Lake. He touched down on the lake which was described as, \"beautiful/perfect\", and about 100 feet after touchdown felt like he \"hit a brick\", further indicating it was obvious from the postcrash damage that he had hit something.

The airplane came to a stop on the right side of the runway centerline about 2,500 ft from its initial touchdown.The operator's stabilized approach criteria require an immediate go-around if the airplane flaps or landing gear were not in the final landing configuration by 1,000 ft above the touchdown zone; in this case, the flaps were not correctly configured until the airplane was passing through 500 ft. Further, the airplane's deviation about the glideslope at 100 to 200 ft would have been another opportunity for the captain, as the PM at this point during the flight, to call for a go-around, as indicated in the Southwest Airlines Flight Operations Manual (FOM). Accident data suggest that pilots often fail to perform a go-around or missed approach when stabilized approach criteria are not met. A review of NTSB-investigated accidents by human factors researchers found that about 75% of accidents were the result of plan continuation errors in which the crew continued an approach despite cues that suggested it should not be continued. Additionally, line operations safety audit data presented at the International Air Safety Summit in 2011 suggested that 97% of unstabilized approaches were continued to landing even though doing so was in violation of companies' standard operating procedures (SOPs).The Southwest FOM also states that the captain can take control of the airplane for safety reasons; however, the captain's decision to take control of the airplane at 27 ft above the ground did not allow her adequate time to correct the airplane's deteriorating energy state and prevent the nose landing gear from striking the runway. The late transfer of control resulted in neither pilot being able to effectively monitor the airplane's altitude and attitude. The first officer reported that, after the captain took control of the airplane, he scanned the altimeter and airspeed to gain situational awareness but that he became distracted by the runway \"rushing\" up to them and \"there was no time to say anything.\" The captain should have called for a go-around when it was apparent that the approach was unstabilized well before the point that she attempted to salvage the landing by taking control of the airplane at a very low altitude.In addition, the captain did not follow SOPs at several points during the flight. As PM, she should have made the standard callout per the Southwest FOM when the airplane was above glideslope, stating \"glideslope\" and adding a descriptive word or words to the callout (for example, \"one dot high\"). Rather than make this callout, however, the captain repeatedly said \"get down\" to the first officer before stating \"I got it.\" The way she handled the transfer of airplane control was also contrary to the FOM, which indicates that the PM should say \"I have the aircraft.\" The flight crew's performance was indicative of poor crew resource management.",
            "probable_cause": "The captain's attempt to recover from an unstabilized approach by transferring airplane control at low altitude instead of performing a go-around. Contributing to the accident was the captain's failure to comply with standard operating procedures."

According to the manufacturer, it \"generates an intense electrostatic ion wind that charges floating particles in the 'breathing zone.'  The particles are substantially repelled away from the wearer, creating an almost particle-free 'exclusion zone' for toxic allergens, smoke, dust, viruses, and bacteria.  Perfumes and odors can also be minimized by the ion particle-charging-effect.\"  The passenger was observed to be holding a Sprint Trio 700 camera phone up to the window, sometimes talking into it, but he claimed he was only taking photographs.  As he held his telephone to the window, there was a noise that sounded \"like a fuse.\"  There was a flash and a loud bang, and smoke emanated from the device.  The passenger yelled and flung the air purifier from around his neck because it had started to burn him.  It exploded into a ball of flames \"about the size of volleyball\" and fell between the seat cushions, starting a fire.  Passengers poured water and other liquids on the smoldering cushions, and a flight attendant used a Halon fire extinguisher to put the fire out.  The battery was never recovered.  NTSB's fire and explosion expert examined the device.  Her report stated that the air purifier originally came with a 3.6V CR123A non-rechargeable lithium primary battery, but a kit containing a charger and a rechargeable lithium-ion battery was available for purchase.  The battery compartment cover was melted and deformed, and had two areas of metal splatter.  Analysis of this splatter revealed the presence of manganese.  Manganese dioxide is a component in primary (non-rechargeable) lithium batteries.  The report noted that a short circuit is the most common cause of battery fires, and that charging a non-rechargeable battery could cause an internal short that could lead to thermal runaway, battery failure, and possibly an explosion.",

The flying pilot inadvertently activated the flight stop augmented fuel flow switch during a power recovery, and oversped the engine and main rotor.  The other pilot joined him on the controls, and increased collective to reduce rotor rpm.  The helicopter climbed abruptly to about 60 feet above the ground, where the tail rotor drive shaft separated. The engine subsequently lost power, and an autorotation was accomplished.  Investigation disclosed that the engine and main rotor system had been exposed to significant overspeed conditions, resulting in a catastrophic failure of the turbine engine, and the tail rotor drive shaft coupling.  The flight stop switch on the collective has no protective guard, and can be readily engaged, allowing the engine to enter the augmented fuel flow regime and, under certain conditions, causing the engine to overspeed.  The switch has a history of inadvertent activation, and resultant engine overspeed events. ",

He reported that the green landing gear position light illuminated after the landing gear extended and that, while on the base leg, when he selected the flaps to 20 degrees he visually confirmed that the left main landing gear was extended. Shortly after touchdown, the left main landing gear began to retract, followed by the right main landing gear. The airplane then veered off the left side of the runway. During the postaccident recovery, as the airplane was lifted off the ground, the main landing gear fully extended, without electrical power supplied, into the down-and-locked position. The landing gear was checked and all three down-lock assemblies appeared to be properly engaged. The airplane was subsequently placed onto jack stands, and no anomalies were observed as the landing gear was cycled several times using the airplane's electro-hydraulic system. Testing of the landing gear position indicating system confirmed that the green position light would not illuminate until all three landing gear were fully extended into a down-and-locked position. The postaccident examination did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have resulted in the main landing gear collapse. In the absence of landing gear extension system mechanical failures or malfunctions, and given the collapse of the main landing gear upon touchdown, it is likely that the landing gear was still transitioning into to a fully extended position at touchdown. Although contrary to the pilot\u2019s account of the accident sequence, the most likely accident scenario is that the pilot did not extend the landing gear with sufficient time to ensure that it fully extended before landing.",

Please see the public docket for this accident to view the original report. **The airplane experienced a total loss of engine power during takeoff from a runway that had a usable length of 6,827 feet; however, the pilot initiated the takeoff from a taxiway intersection, which left only about 5,313 feet of runway remaining. After the loss of engine power, the airplane descended to about 10 feet above ground level (agl) with the landing gear retracted; about half of the runway length remained. Engine power was restored, and the airplane subsequently climbed to between about 300 and 400 agl. The engine again lost power, and the airplane subsequently stalled and impacted a field. The landing gear remained retracted. Typically, the landing gear should be retracted after liftoff when the airplane has reached an altitude where, in the event of an engine failure or other emergency requiring an aborted takeoff, the airplane could no longer be landed on the runway.The airplane arrived at the departure airport 3 days before the accident and was parked on the ramp.

When water was poured onto the fuel caps when they were placed and secured back into position, they exhibited leakage into the fuel tank; however, the extent of deformation around the filler neck due to accident damage was unknown. During the most recent annual inspection, it was noted that the fuel cap O-rings were replaced because of water contamination of the fuel system. No record was found indicating that maintenance personnel pressurized the fuel tanks to check for fuel cap leakage in accordance with the airplane manufacturer's maintenance instructions.

The pilot checked to ensure that the mixture was at full rich and turned on the fuel pump, but there was no change in the sound of the engine. He then switched fuel tanks, but there was still no change, and the airplane was losing altitude. The pilot stated that he had the throttle at full forward but that the engine was not making full power. He subsequently made a forced landing to an open field.During the postaccident examination, downloaded data from the airplane\u2019s multi-function display (MFD) revealed that when he began the missed approach at 04:01:00, the pilot did not return the engine mixture to a full rich condition; the climb back to 6,000 feet was performed at a setting less than full rich. The data indicated that at 04:06:00, the engine was making full power; however, the fuel flow was at a very lean setting. The data further indicated that the cylinder head temperature (CHT) and the Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) were elevated. One of these two elevated temperatures likely tripped a red annunciator on the panel, prompting the pilot to go to the full rich condition at 04:06:30. When the pilot was leveling off, the CHTs started a steady drop along with the oil temperature. The TIT immediately dropped to a more normal value when the pilot advanced the mixture to full rich. At 04:09:30, the manifold pressure dropped, which indicated that the pilot closed the throttle. At 04:10:15, the data revealed that the airplane began a relatively normal descent, and that the MAP continued to decrease in steps. About 2 minutes later, or about 1 minute 45 seconds prior to the end of the data, the descent rate increased to about 1,800 feet per minute and remained there until the end of the data. At this time the MAP indicated that the throttle was closed or nearly closed. Data for MAP and TIT are consistent with the engine running with the throttle closed, or nearly closed, throughout the final descent until the data ended at 04:14:06. Accordingly, the MFD data did not reveal any evidence of a powerplant-related failure. Postaccident testing and examination of fuel samples revealed that two out-of-range results were noted, consistent with aged fuel. The postaccident examination also revealed that spark plug coloration was indicative of an even distribution of fuel to each cylinder and that there was no indication during the examination of a clogged fuel nozzle. Additionally, MFD data did not support the presence of a plugged fuel nozzle during the accident flight. Therefore, the investigation could not definitively determine if the condition of the fuel was contributory to the partial loss of power.During the postaccident examination, the engine was run successfully and no mechanical anomalies or failures were noted that would have precluded normal operation; the loss of engine power could not be duplicated.",

The airplane then turned left onto the crosswind leg of the traffic pattern and maintained a slight climb.  One witness, who was in a vehicle, observed the airplane in normal flight on a left downwind for runway 19 at an altitude of 800 to 1,000 feet.  The witness observed the airplane turn left (west) onto the base leg for runway 19 \"in normal flight and was descending but not what appeared to be abnormal.\"  The airplane continued its nose-low descent toward the terrain until approximately 200 feet agl, the airplane began a \"steeper\" nose-low descent toward terrain.  The airplane then impacted terrain in a wings level attitude, bounced, nosed over, and came to rest inverted.  During the descent, the witness did not noticed any movement of the elevator or other flight control surfaces, or any in-flight structural failure of the airplane.  The accident flight was the third flight conducted by the pilot since he had completed repairs after sustaining a hard landing with the airplane.  In order to complete the repairs to the airplane, the pilot had to removed the elevator and aileron controls located in the boom tube.  NTSB materials laboratory examination of the aileron and elevator controls revealed no features or marks were found at a location of approximately 5/16-inch forward of the original location of the rear locking collar on the torque tube surface, with the exception of two distinct circumferential marks.  The featureless surface, confirmed by testing, indicated that the locking collar was slightly torqued and that the torque tube had moved relatively slowly over this distance, possibly with two stops.  The torque required to loosen the rear locking collar screw was measured at 3-inch pounds, representing a minimal snugging of the collar bolt and collar on the torque tube.  According to the manufacturer, a 3/16-inch aft movement of the torque tube would be enough to lose any tension in the elevator control cables.  The rear edge of the cutout on the boom tube for the rear control stick displayed three locations where paint had been removed, but there was no material deformation.  The lack of deformation is consistent with light contact by the control stick, which would be expected if the control stick had been pulled rearwards manually.  A lightly rubbed area on the aileron crank revealed laterally orientated arced lines on the surface and corresponding laterally orientated smeared surface on the upper front bulkhead tube.  No evidence was found to indicate that an inspection mirror had been trapped in the boom tube.",

Sanders Aircraft, Inc., was operating both airplanes under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The private pilot in the Cessna sustained fatal injuries; the commercial pilot and one passenger in the Sea Fury were not injured. The Cessna was destroyed during the accident sequence, and the Sea Fury sustained substantial damage to the empennage. Both cross-country personal flights departed Half Moon Bay, California; the Sea Fury departed about 1530 and the Cessna departed at an unknown time. Both airplanes were en route to Eagle's Nest Airport, Ione, California. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed, and no flight plans had been filed.The National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge (IIC) interviewed the Sea Fury pilot. The Sea Fury pilot stated the he and the Cessna pilot had flown their airplanes to Half Moon Bay to display them at an open house for the airport. The pilot reported that after departure, he flew over the airport, and rendezvoused with a Beechcraft A36 Bonanza for a photo shoot over the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. They flew several 360-degree patterns over the bridge, completed their photo work, and he set his course for the return to Ione.While en route the Sea Fury pilot broadcast on a common frequency, and the Cessna pilot responded with his position. The Sea Fury pilot made visual contact with the Cessna, which was ahead and to his left. He broadcast to the Cessna pilot that he would pass low and to the left. The Cessna pilot responded that it would be a good picture. The Sea Fury pilot replied that probably not due to the speed differential; the Sea Fury airspeed was about 200 miles per hour. The Sea Fury pilot proceeded on a path that he thought would allow adequate separation; however, as he was passing the Cessna, he felt and heard a thump and he realized that the two airplanes had collided. He pulled up and looked over his shoulder and he observed the Cessna inverted and going down.The Sea Fury pilot stated that he concentrated on flying his airplane, and initiated a climb, and conducted a controllability check to determine that he could control the airplane in the current configuration. He wanted to avoid populated areas, so he continued toward his home airport. While en route he contacted company personnel, who decided to fly another company airplane to meet and examine the Sea Fury's condition. The Sea Fury pilot lowered the landing gear, and did a controllability check to include turns. He lowered the flaps, and repeated the testing. He reduced airspeed to a landing compatible speed of 130 mph, and checked controllability again. Determining that he had adequate control to land, he made a full stop landing at his home airport.The Sea Fury is silver in color and the Cessna has blue wingtips with blue paint on the leading edge of both wings, on top of the cowling, and along the sides of the fuselage.During the postaccident examination of the Sea Fury it was noted that the top remaining portion of the vertical stabilizer was crushed aft and down with blue paint transfer marks on the aft portion of the remaining metal. The operator reported that the missing vertical stabilizer section was about 12 inches long. The rudder had crush damage. The right elevator separated outboard of the middle hinge and about 3 feet of the elevator was missing. About 3 feet of the outboard section of the right horizontal stabilizer was missing. The outboard fracture surface was jagged and angular, and the upper surface had crushed inboard in an accordion fashion. Blue paint transfer marks and scratches were observed on the upper surface and within the folds of the metal.The Cessna descended into San Pablo Bay, and the wreckage was retrieved on April 30. The recovered wreckage consisted of the fuselage and the engine. The left wing was not located. The propeller separated from the crankshaft, and was not located.",

There were no witnesses to the accident.  The local solo instructional flight departed about 45 minutes prior to the accident.   Recorded radar data indicated that the airplane flew on a southerly course and conducted numerous aerial maneuvers consistent with the type normally practiced during primary flight training.  Following the maneuvers, the airplane landed at a nearby uncontrolled airport, then departed again in a northeast direction for 3.8 nm until radar contact was lost.  The last radar contact was about 800 feet laterally west of initial impact point, at an above ground altitude of 2,400 feet.  The airplane impacted the ground in a steep left bank with a nose low attitude around 30 degrees.  The debris field was approximately 100 feet in length, with an energy path opposite in direction to the flight track shown by the recorded radar data.  All flight control surfaces were located within the immediate area of the accident site.  The right wing separated from the fuselage and was located 30 feet from the fuselage.  The right wing aileron balance cable exhibited a tension overload failure inside the right wing.  The right wing primary aileron cable was found disconnected at the turnbuckle where it attaches to its corresponding rod end clevis fitting located in the fuselage.  The turnbuckle barrel remained attached to the primary cable assembly and the clevis fitting remained attached to the link assembly.  The turnbuckle barrel was safety wired on the outboard half that attaches to the primary cable and the safety wire looped back onto itself locking the turnbuckle barrel to the cable.  No safety wire or locking device was found on the inboard half of the turnbuckle barrel or clevis fitting.  Visual inspection of the threads of both the turnbuckle barrel and the clevis end disclosed that they were undamaged.  According to the Piper PA-38-112 parts catalog, the primary cable turnbuckle barrel is to be secured with NAS651-16S locking clips on both sides; however, no clips were found at the accident site or during the subsequent detailed inspection of the wreckage.  With the particular configuration of the turnbuckle assembly, it could not be properly secured by the use of safety wire alone.  Measurement of the primary right wing aileron cable found that it was not stretched and there was no evidence to indicate that it was connected during the impact sequence.  Aircraft records indicated the aileron flight control cable system, including the primary right wing aileron turnbuckle area, were visually inspected at the last 100-hour inspection.  The aircraft maintenance records did not have any entries involving the adjustment, removal, or replacement of the aileron flight control cables or components, and the investigation was unable to establish when the safety wire was substituted for the NAS651-16S clips.  The three pilots who had flown the airplane on the day before the accident (including one instructional flight and a private pilot practical flight test) reported that  there were no discrepancies with the airplane during the flights.  The physical evidence is wholly consistent with the primary aileron cable turnbuckle not being connected at ground impact.  It is unlikely that the departure from controlled flight that resulted in the ground collision was due to the disconnected aileron cable; however, such a disconnect clearly could hinder any upset recovery effort.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed with no evidence of unusual, hazardous, or violent weather in the area.  Evidence clearly shows the engine was producing significant power at ground impact.",
            "probable_cause": "The student pilot's failure to regain control of the aircraft following an upset due to the disconnected primary right aileron control cable.  The failure of the company maintenance personnel to detect and correct the improperly secured turnbuckle fitting at the last 100-hour inspection is also causal."

The pilot initially reported a turbulence encounter at 9,500 feet, and that he saw damage on the upper surface of both wings. He did not recall a significant loss of altitude or loss of control. Data downloaded from the flight displays after the event indicated that the airplane actually climbed to 15,400 feet above mean sea level (msl), nearly 17,500 feet density altitude, which was the maximum operating altitude for the airplane. The airplane then slowed, stalled, and began a rapid descent, losing 13,000 feet of altitude in about 40 seconds before recovering. During recovery, the airplane had an average of more than 4 Gs vertical loading for more than 20 seconds. Such loading would likely have resulted in G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) or near-loss of consciousness. The pilot's apparent failure to accurately recall the events of the flight is likely a result of the confusion associated with hypoxia, and the subsequent confusion and amnesia associated with G-LOC or near G-LOC. It is unclear exactly why the pilot chose to increase his altitude beyond 12,500 feet msl, above which oxygen use would have been required after 30 minutes. Regardless, he continued to climb the airplane above 14,000 feet msl, an altitude above which oxygen use would have been required by the pilot regardless of the time spent at that altitude, and he subsequently climbed to above 15,000 feet, at which point oxygen use would have been required by all occupants.

Review of the pilot's logbook revealed he flew 11.3 total night hours in 2007, and that he logged .2 hours of night 5 days prior to the accident. The pilot's last instrument dual instructional flight was on March 6, 1981, and the last simulated instrument flight was on December 1, 2003. The closest weather reporting facility located 7.5 miles from the accident site reported an overcast ceiling of 1,000 feet. At the time of the accident, the moon and sun were more than 11 degrees below the horizon. Review of radar data revealed the flight altitude varied from 800 feet to a high of 2,400 feet. The airplane was observed on radar to turn to the left, and back to the right four different times. The last radar contact with the airplane was 20 statute miles from the accident site. A witness who lived 10 statute miles from the accident site stated he was at his home, and heard an airplane approaching. He looked out the window towards the west, the ceilings were between 800 to 1000 feet, and it was dark with very little ambient light. He observed the airplane flying from the west to the east, and the navigation and landing lights were on. The airplane appeared to be near the base of the clouds, and it passed north of his house, and started a turn to the north, where it disappeared from view. Examination of the crash site revealed the airplane collided with a swamp, and a tree-lined open field in a nose low, right wing down attitude on a heading of 360 degrees magnetic. The wreckage debris line extended 219 feet. Examination of the airframe, flight controls, engine assembly, and accessories, revealed no evidence of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction.",

The pilot selected runway 15, which had a 6-knot tailwind component at the time of the attempted takeoff. During the engine run-up, no mechanical discrepancies were noted. The engine attained full power before the pilot released the brakes to commence the takeoff roll. Prior to reaching the prescribed rotation airspeed, the airplane's nose pitched up and the airplane became airborne. The pilot reported that he continued attempting to maintain control of the airplane while in ground effect. The airplane then climbed above ground effect, and the left cockpit door inadvertently opened. Just as the pilot closed the door, the airplane stalled, impacted an estimated 6-foot high dirt berm, and crashed into an open field about 1,000 feet south of the runway's departure end. During the postaccident examination, about 40 gallons of fuel were found in each of the two wing tanks, for a total of 80 gallons onboard at the time of the accident. The elevator trim tab was found in the full nose-up position, and examination of that system disclosed normal function. All of the items from the baggage compartment were removed and weighed on a scale; the baggage compartment contents weighed 288 pounds, which is 88 pounds above the compartment limit. Using the airplane\u2019s empty weight and center of gravity listed in the weight and balance section of the airplane flight manual (AFM), the actual weights of the occupants, the fuel load found on the airplane, and the weight of the baggage compartment contents, the investigation determined that the airplane\u2019s gross weight at the accident site was 4,173.41 pounds, with a center of gravity (CG) 117.9 inches aft of the datum. The AFM and the FAA-approved Type Certificate Data sheet list the maximum allowable gross weight as 3,900 pounds with an aft CG limit at 117.5 inches. Airplanes at or aft of the rear CG limit are very sensitive in pitch control, and may even be at or near a dynamically unstable flight regime in terms of pitch handling and dampening characteristics. Accordingly, the airplane would have been especially sensitive to the full nose-up trim tab adjustment. Additionally, stall speeds increase as gross weight increases, so in the takeoff condition the airplane would have stalled at a higher airspeed, sooner than the pilot would have normally experienced and expected.",

Looking out the windshield, he observed that the propeller had separated from the airplane. The pilot subsequently executed a forced landing to a field. Metallurgical examination determined that the propeller separation was initiated by a fatigue failure of two propeller flange-to-engine crankshaft flange attachment bolts. Further examination revealed that an incorrect thread lock compound was used on the propeller bolts, and the presence of a second compound suggested that the bolts were not properly cleaned before installation. In addition, washers used in the installation did not correspond with the washers specified by the manufacturer. Finally, extensive fretting damage to the propeller and crankshaft flanges in conjunction with the limited number of flight hours indicated that the attachment bolts were not torqued sufficiently at the time of installation. Available maintenance records did not include any entry noting that the propeller assembly had been removed since the initial installation.",

The pilot maintained directional control and made a hard landing in a wash-out.  The helicopter remained upright, but the skids were completely spread, the tail rotor blades were damaged, and the fuselage sustained structural damage.  Further examination of the engine revealed that a castellated nut used to secure the governor lever control rod to the idler bell crank had come completely loose, and the cotter pin that secured the nut was missing.  The engine had  been replaced 5.1 hours prior to the accident by a contract maintenance facility.  The mechanic stated that during the first engine run-up, he discovered an oil leak on the left side of the engine.  As a result, the engine was shut down and the linkages on the left side of the engine were disassembled, including the governor level control rod assembly.  During the reassembly, he got distracted by a phone call, which delayed him from completing the repair.  As a result, when he returned to complete the repair, he got \"tunnel vision\" and forgot to install the cotter pin during the reassembly process, which would have kept the castellated nut that secured the attachment bolt for the governor level control rod from loosening. According to CBP,  their agency was responsible for the oversight of this maintenance and the helicopter was returned to service in accordance with the military technical manuals.   However, there were no established inspection procedures to properly accept an aircraft that had just undergone a major repair.  In addition, a review of the OH-6A Technical Manuals revealed that only a standard castellated nut and cotter pin was needed to properly install the governor lever control rod, while the more recent Hughes 500 repair manual and an FAA Airworthiness Directive required a castellated nut with fiber inserts to prevent the nut from backing off.",

On his first attempted landing, the pilot conducted a go-around. The pilot said that he was \"high and fast\" on the second attempt, even though the runway was equipped with a 2-light precision approach path indicator which would have given the pilot guidance to touch down with the first one-third of the runway. The airplane touched down about 3,000 feet down the 3,998-foot runway. The pilot then applied full power to abort the landing. After lifting off, the airplane pitched up, and, according to the pilot, the engine failed. About 200 feet above ground level, the airplane banked left and settled back toward the ground; it then impacted the ground and slid to a stop about 850 feet off the end of the runway. Immediately after the accident, the pilot exited the wreckage and was observed leaving the airport. A postaccident examination and test run of the engine revealed no evidence of any anomalies that would have precluded normal engine operation. According to a witness, on the morning of the accident, she observed the pilot consume 12 to 16 alcoholic beverages between 0745 and 1230 when the pilot left to meet his passenger for the flight. After the accident, the Vermont State Police made contact with the pilot at his residence, where he refused a breathalyzer test. Given the airplane's performance during and after the pitch up, and the absence of any indications of an engine anomaly, the airplane likely entered an aerodynamic stall; the pilot's failure to adequately maintain airspeed and pitch control after the aborted landing, which resulted in the stall, was likely related to his consumption of alcohol.",

The pilot also reported that when he returned to the airport a week after the accident, he noted a gap in the distance between the northern end of the runway's lights and the southern end of the runway's lights.  Four light fixtures were absent of light bulbs at the approach end of the runway and many of the light fixtures did not have protective coverings for the bulbs.  Several of the uncovered bulbs had no dust or water marks indicating they had been recently replaced.  The pilot stated that he most likely landed mid-field due to partial illumination of the runway lighting.  He said, \"If all the runway lights were illuminated the week before, this accident would not have happened.\"  ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's misjudgment of the runway distance due to his misperception of his location point on the runway."

He then used a small stool and checked both wing with the calibrated tube he had purchased for that purpose, and the tube showed that that there were 8 gallons in the right fuel tank, and 7 gallons in the left. After completing the pretakeoff items, the pilot affected a takeoff, with the intention of remaining in the pattern. While on left downwind, in the area of the end of the landing runway, the pilot said the engine backfired 2 or 3 times quickly as he retarded the throttle control to reduce power and make the approach.  He said he did not think too much about it, because he thought he had possibly retarded the throttle control too quickly. While on final approach he was a bit too high, so the pilot said he pushed the throttle and carburetor heat controls full forward, and did a full power low pass over the runway. He said the engine was operating fine, and developed full power as he climbed out. While still climbing he turned crosswind, and then initiated the turn downwind. During the turn to left downwind, the pilot said the engine \"back popped a few times and lost all  power.\" The pilot said he avoided trees and tried to align with the runway to affect a forced landing, but the airplane was descending fast, and he touched down on a cross taxiway, at the end of the runway. During the landing rollout the nose-wheel dug into the soft dirt, and the airplane nosed over, incurring damage. An FAA inspector and a representative of Teledyne Continental Motors performed a postcrash examination of the aircraft.

According to the pilot's written statement, during the landing he touched down 5 to 6 feet prior to the painted \"24\" on the runway. He then lowered the nose of the airplane and \"retracted\" the wing flaps. He then pushed the control stick forward and applied the brakes by squeezing the control-stick-mounted brake handle, but braking did not occur. He then applied the brakes a second time, extended the speed brakes, wiggled the control stick, and pushed the control stick forward and applied the brakes a third time without result before applying them a fourth time. He then felt the anti-skid engage. The airplane then struck a chain link fence and went over an embankment before impacting the ground, nosing over, and coming to rest inverted. The pilot was seriously injured during the impact sequence and the airplane incurred substantial damage to the forward fuselage.Review of the pilot's statement also revealed that he had not touched down at 96 knots indicated airspeed, as specified by the landing speeds chart, but had touched down at 106 knots, which would have extended his landing distance by about 20 percent. Further, witnesses observed the airplane actually touch down about 300 to 400 feet past the painted \"24\" on the runway, not the 5 to 6 feet prior to the painted \"24\" as stated by the pilot. Skid marks that matched the width of the airplane's main landing gear geometry were also present on the runway surface. The marks started about 1,270 feet past the painted \"24\" on the runway and continued until they left the pavement.Review of performance planning charts also revealed that the safety margin for operating at the airport was insufficient: even if the airplane had touched down just prior to the painted \"24\" on the runway, the pilot would already have 205 feet of the usable runway behind him, and with moderate braking the landing roll would have been about 2,500 feet, and the landing distance, when landing over a 50 foot obstacle, would have been about 3,370 feet. With intensive braking, the landing roll would have been about 2,000 feet, and the landing distance, when landing over a 50 foot obstacle, would have been about 2,900 feet. The pilot also would not have met the accelerate/stop criteria for takeoff or a balked landing, as the airplane required 3,600 feet to accelerate to takeoff speed and then stop after an aborted takeoff. Examination of the airplane did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction that would have resulted in failure of the normal braking system. The flaps were also in the 44 degree (landing) position and had not been retracted, as was required for a minimum run landing to reduce lift, increase weight on the wheels, and reduce tire skidding. Examination of the flight manual also revealed that, in the event of a brake failure, activation of the main wheel brake units still would have been possible if the pilot had operated the emergency brake lever. According to the flight manual, he should have used the emergency brake lever if he believed that he had lost normal braking.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's excessive airspeed and failure to attain the proper landing point, which resulted in the airplane touching down too fast and too far down the short runway. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to retract the flaps after landing, which resulted in delayed brake activation, the pilot\u2019s decision to land on a runway with an insufficient safety margin for the landing conditions, and the pilot\u2019s failure to use the emergency brake lever."

According to the pilot, the engine \"suddenly lost power and started running rough\" while in cruise flight at 6,500 feet mean sea level.  The pilot set the propeller to low pitch and manipulated the engine throttle without any noticeable effect on engine operation.  The engine continued to run \"rough\" after he switched fuel tanks.  The pilot elected to perform an off-field landing on a \"narrow gravel lane with rough surface and significant potholes.\"  During the landing rollout the airplane departed off the left side of the road and nosed over in the adjacent ditch.  During subsequent testing, the engine demonstrated normal operation throughout its entire rpm/horsepower range.  Engine rpm was cycled rapidly between flight idle and maximum continuous rpm several times without any hesitation in engine operation.  No anomalies were noted during the engine test run that would have prevented its normal operation.  At departure, the airplane reportedly had 38 gallons of 100 low lead aviation fuel onboard.  Examination of the wreckage confirmed there was sufficient fuel available for engine operation, and there was fuel found in the line from the fuselage to the mechanical fuel pump.",
