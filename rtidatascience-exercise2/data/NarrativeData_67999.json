The purpose of the flight was for the student to receive dual flight instruction to become more acquainted with the airplane's handling characteristics.  The student met with his certified flight instructor and received a briefing regarding the upcoming lesson involving, in part, takeoff and landing practice.  The instructor directed his student to perform a simulated engine out approach, and engine power was reduced as the airplane glided toward the airport.  The student entered a close in downwind approach and, at the direction of the instructor, then performed a left circling turn onto the base and final approach legs.  The landing gear was lowered, and the student questioned the instructor regarding whether they could glide all the way to the runway.  The instructor advised his student to maintain 90 knots airspeed.  During the descent, as the airplane turned from the close in base leg onto the final approach leg, the instructor told his student \"don't bank.\"  The student rolled the wings level.  Immediately thereafter, the left bank began a second time and the instructor again said, \"Don't bank.\"  The student replied, \"I'm not.\"  The instructor applied engine power and right rudder to reduce the left bank.

He said that he issued corrective instructions to the student twice before taking the flight controls. The instructor moved the throttle forward to increase power, and the engine stopped producing power. He selected a forced landing site, issued a Mayday call to the tower, and attempted an engine restart. However, he had to conduct a power-off landing on a roadway. Before ground contact, the airplane struck wires, and, during the accident sequence, the nose gear and tail section of the airplane separated.During the examination of the wreckage, the engine was started, and it ran continuously on the airframe using the airplane's own fuel system. However, when the power was reduced to idle, the engine did not respond as expected to subsequent throttle and mixture inputs. After the initial run, the operator's director of maintenance was asked to produce the tools and documents used to calibrate the fuel system at installation. He produced instructions and gauges that resembled those used at the manufacturer\u2019s factory, but no calibration stickers were displayed on the gauges. The gauges were installed, and, during a subsequent engine run, both the metered and unmetered fuel pressure readings were below factory specifications.The fuel system was removed and flow tested at the engine manufacturer's facility. The fuel pump and fuel control assembly were intact, and bench testing demonstrated their ability to function, but both were found with several parameters outside of their respective calibrated specifications. The fuel manifold and nozzles were also tested and found to exhibit a normal flow vs. pressure indication on the test bench. The fuel pump was found adjusted \"down\" and flowed less than the required fuel flow specifications. The throttle body and mixture control unit were found adjusted to a position that allowed more than the required fuel flow at three specific settings. The combination of both the fuel pump and throttle body mixture control adjustments resulted in an idle fuel flow rate 2.5 times the maximum required. When the throttle was advanced quickly to full throttle, the fuel flow rate was 40 percent of the required rate. This significant transition in fuel flow rates likely resulted in a momentary \"cavitation\" of the fuel pump, which allowed air to enter the system and resulted in a total loss of engine power.",

The puncture had been repaired; however, manufacturer's specifications stated that this type damage is nonrepairable and the blade should be scrapped.  In July 1995, the rotor blade was modified.  During the modification process, the blade was inspected for damage.  In April 1997, an AD requiring inspection of the blade was complied with. ",

The airplane was initially in radio and data link communications with Oakland ARTCC, then ARINC, and finally with Anchorage ARTCC.  A PIREP at 1432 for moderate turbulence, and an Urgent PIREP at 1600 of severe turbulence, were recorded in the area of incident by Anchorage ARTCC.  As the flight entered the Alaska ARTCC area, a delay in establishing communications with the airplane also delayed the transmission of the urgent PIREP concerning turbulence in the area of the flight.

At 0011:38, Kansas City ARTCC (ZKC) informed the pilot that the weather at the Joplin Regional Airport (JLN) was 800 broken, 5,000 overcast and 10 miles visibility.  The pilot, operating under visual flight rules, told ZKC that they would need an instrument approach into JLN.  ZKC cleared the pilot to JLN and gave the pilot radar vectors to the ILS to runway 13.  At 0031:35, the pilot told ZKC that he was getting warning flags for the localizer and glide slope.  The pilot elected to transition to the ILS for runway 18.  ZKC gave him vectors for the approach.  At 0033:46, ZKC asked the pilot if he still had plenty of fuel?  The pilot confirmed he had 2 hours of fuel on board.  At 0042:30, ZKC cleared the pilot for the ILS approach.  At 0046:36, ZKC lost radar contact with the airplane.  The pilot told ZKC they were at 2,700 feet, descending.  At 0048:40, ZKC transmitted to the pilot that his airplane was just about over JLN at 2,400 feet.  The pilot told ZKC they were going missed approach and requested another approach to runway 18.  At 0055:16, the pilot transmitted, \"... we're having a little problem here I think we've lost an engine I'm trying to get leveled off here and get back to 4,000 feet.\"  ZKC told the pilot, \"... keep me advised.\"  At 0056:06, ZKC transmitted that he showed the airplane descending below 2,300 feet.  There was no response from the airplane.  The last positions recorded by ZKC radar showed the airplane 3 miles east of JLN in a rapid descent.  Witnesses on the ground heard an airplane make several passes over Carterville, Missouri.  One witness said that on the airplane's third pass, it sounded like a single engine airplane.  Another witness said she saw the lights on the airplane.

On-scene examination revealed that the Thomas coupling disc assembly on the aft end of the aft short shaft was twisted and bent, and the tail rotor drive shaft just aft of the coupling was bent and separated, about mid-length.  A retaining bolt was missing from the Thomas coupling.  The missing bolt and washers were found in the helicopter's tailrotor drive shaft tunnel area, and appeared to be undamaged.

The forward face of the flange adapter contained a series of rotational scoring and impact marks from contact with the bolt heads and discs.  The pattern of damage was consistent with the short shaft rotating around the bolt opposite from the missing bolt.  Additional examination of the Thomas coupling and associated components revealed that portions of the normal seating positions for the head of the missing bolt and the washer were relatively free of dirt and grease, and that the bore surface of the hole for the missing bolt in the flanged adapter at the forward end of the first segment contained thread imprint marks.",

The wreckage was dispersed over an approximate nineteen-acre area to the left and right of a line drawn between the area where the last radar contact had occurred and the main wreckage site. The main wreckage site, which comprised of the fuselage, was located in a wooded area approximately 6.7 miles west of the Bob Sikes Airport, Crestview, FL. The overall debris path was approximately .4 miles long on a northwest heading and the initial pieces along the path were the vertical fin, rudder, and left aileron. There was no evidence of a post crash fire in the area of the main wreckage site or at any of the secondary locations and no evidence or any patterns like those typically associated with an in-flight fire were identified. Level 4 weather returns had been on either side of the airplane. The airplane was about 3.7 miles due west of KCEW, and had begun a right turn to a course of about 260 degrees.  At 1357:40, the airplane was about 3.7 miles southeast of the Crestview VORTAC, at 8,000 feet, and on a course of about 285 degrees. The pilot of the accident airplane requested \"a course of one eighty to the left for weather\".  North Approach replied \"is that a one eight zero heading?\" The pilot responded \"one eight zero,\" and North Approach approved the request.  The airplane was entering the eastern edge of an area of Level 4 returns. At 1358:01, the airplane began a descent and a turn to the left.  The last radar target was received at 1358:54, about 53 seconds after initiation of the turn, and all radar returns in the area  depicted Level 4 weather activity at the time when air traffic control (ATC) lost communications with the accident airplane. According to the North Approach Radar Controller, who was communicating with the airplane, his workload was moderate on the day of the accident, with about four or five aircraft and that he had been on position for about two to three minutes when the pilot contacted him.  The controller stated that he would normally advise a pilot of observed weather returns, but did not do so for the accident airplane or other pilots in the same general area.  He said he did not issue a weather advisory to the accident airplane because in his opinion, \"the pilot was seeing everything out there [and] telling [me] what he needed to do\". Examination of the airframe, engines and flight controls did not reveal any preaccident failures or malfunction to any airplane systems.",

Several witnesses reported seeing the tail boom, main rotor hub, main rotor blades, and other debris separate from the helicopter. One witness heard a \"loud crack\" sound. A postaccident examination revealed that  the helicopter's swashplate A-side drive pin had failed in flight, which resulted in the helicopter's in-flight breakup and uncontrolled descent. The separated head of the drive pin remained in the interior of the swashplate. The fractured drive pin hole exhibited mechanical damage, with the markings of increased amplitude and spacing progressing outward, which suggests that the fractured drive pin oscillated and then ejected from its hole.The fracture surface of the swashplate A-side drive pin displayed brittle cleavage-like fractures interspersed with intergranular separations and small regions of ductile dimples, consistent with hydrogen embrittlement. The B-side drive pin, on the opposite side, was found intact. Both drive pins met engineering drawing requirements for material, hardness, heat treatment and plating. However, there were no engineering standards for hydrogen content. During tests of two pins intentionally charged with hydrogen, one pin fractured under static load, and the fracture topography was consistent with the fracture topography on the failed A-side pin from the accident helicopter. Based on the fracture topography, it is likely that the swashplate A-side drive pin fractured as a result of hydrogen embrittlement. Investigators were unable to conclusively determine the source of the hydrogen. No other material discrepancies of the drive pin were found. Metallurgical examination revealed that fractures through the mast, B-side pitch link bolt and actuator attachments were consistent with overstress separations.",

While being vectored for an instrument approach, the pilot declared an emergency and reported that the airplane was out of fuel. He said the airplane lost engine power and that he was heading toward the destination airport. The airplane descended through clouds and impacted trees and terrain short of its destination. No preimpact anomalies were found during a postaccident examination. The postaccident examination revealed about 1.5 ounces of a liquid consistent with avgas within the airplane fuel system. Based on the three previous flight legs and refueling receipts, postaccident calculations indicated that the airplane was consuming fuel at a higher rate than referenced in the airplane flight manual. Based on this consumption rate, the airplane did not have enough fuel to reach the destination airport; however, a 20-knot tailwind was predicted, so it is likely that the pilot was relying on this to help the airplane reach the airport. Regardless, he would have been flying with less than the 45-minute fuel reserve that is required for an instrument flight rules flight. The pilot failed to recognize and compensate for the airplane\u2019s high fuel consumption rate during the accident flight. It is likely that had the pilot monitored the gauges and the consumption rate for the flight he would have determined that he did not have adequate fuel to complete the flight.Toxicology tests showed the pilot had tetrahydrocannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (marijuana) in his system; however, the level of impairment could not be determined based on the information available. However, marijuana use can impair the ability to concentrate and maintain vigilance and can distort the perception of time and distance. As a professional pilot, the use of marijuana prior to the flight raises questions about the pilot\u2019s decision-making.The investigation also identified several issues that were not causal to the accident but nevertheless raised concerns about the company\u2019s operational control of the flight. The operator had instituted a fuel log, but it was not regularly monitored. The recovered load manifest showed the pilot had been on duty for more than 15 hours, which exceeded the maximum of 14 hours for a regularly assigned duty period per 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135. The operator stated that it was aware of the pilot\u2019s two driving while under the influence of alcohol convictions, but the operator did not request a background report on the pilot before he was hired.

He then added 20 gallons of fuel to the left wing fuel tank and 25 gallons to the right wing fuel tank. He then entered the added amount of fuel into the fuel computer for a total of 110 gallons, which was consistent with the fuel gauges, which display fuel in pounds and which indicated that 275 pounds of fuel was in the left tank and 350 pounds of fuel was in the right tank. This amount should have been sufficient for the flight.\u000b\u000bAfter departure, the pilot turned toward his destination and climbed the airplane to about 3,000 feet above sea level. Later, the right engine began to surge, and \u201cafter going through the checklist\u201d the pilot elected to do a precautionary landing. The pilot asked air traffic control for the closest airfield; however, the pilot, after seeing nothing but trees, decided to land on a road with the landing gear in the up position. During the landing, the left wingtip struck a tree. \u000b\u000bExamination of the wreckage revealed that both propellers were in the feathered position, the wing flaps were up, the landing gear was up, and the wing structure and both firewalls were substantially damaged. Further examination revealed that the left wing fuel tank contained about 22 gallons of fuel, and the right wing fuel tank was almost devoid of fuel. Thus, it is likely that the pilot did not monitor the fuel balance and allowed an imbalance between the two fuel tanks to occur, which resulted in the right engine being starved of fuel. This could have been remedied at any time during the cruise portion of the flight if the pilot had opened the cross-feed valve for the right engine, which would have allowed the right engine to feed fuel from the left tank and would have allowed him to balance the fuel load.\u000b\u000bExamination of the cockpit switches revealed that the airplane had not been properly configured by the pilot for one-engine-inoperative flight per the guidance contained in the operating manual. If this had been done, the the airplane could have continued to fly at altitude, allowing the pilot to reach a diversionary airport and execute a one-engine-inoperative landing. \u000b",

While en route to that airport, the pilots discussed the \u201c4H\u2019s - High, Heavy, Hot, and Humid\u201d and their effects on performance. The pilots intended to initiate all maneuvers about 500 feet above ground level (agl). This was contrary to the Los Angeles Police Department instructor's guide, which specifies that such maneuvers be initiated 700 feet agl. After performing several training maneuvers with no incident, the pilots performed two autorotations. During the first autorotation, the approach became unstabilized, and the flight instructor initiated a power recovery. The flight instructor reported that during the second autorotation, the helicopter developed a high sink rate and was pushed away from the intended landing spot by the wind. The flight instructor said that he again initiated a power recovery, but the engine did not seem to be producing the necessary power, and the helicopter landed hard.  Postaccident examination revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Downloaded data from a recording device on the helicopter revealed that the accident autorotation was initiated about 300 feet agl and resulted in an average descent rate of 1,747 feet per minute during the 8 seconds before the helicopter struck the ground. The calculated density altitude at the time of the accident was 5,214 feet; this condition would have made the engine less responsive, which would have increased the rate of descent. If the maneuver had been initiated at the company-approved altitude of 700 feet, the pilot might have had sufficient altitude to recover from the maneuver in the existing conditions.",

When the airplane was about 33 miles from the airport, the local controller instructed the pilot to turn left 15 degrees to intercept the localizer for the landing runway and descend to 2,000 feet msl. Radar data showed the airplane turn to intercept the localizer but then overshoot the inbound course. The airplane was about 2 miles left (north) of course and continuing north when the local controller advised the pilot that he had flown through the final approach course and was still northbound. The pilot acknowledged the information and requested a vector to turn back to the localizer course. The local controller then instructed the pilot to turn right 70 degrees to re-intercept the inbound course, and the pilot acknowledged the heading. Radar data showed the airplane turn onto the localizer course. When the airplane was 4 miles from the final approach fix, the local controller cleared the approach and instructed the pilot to contact the tower. After the pilot contacted the tower, the tower controller cleared the airplane for landing. After the pilot told the tower controller that the airplane was at 3,000 feet msl, the controller cancelled the landing clearance because the airplane was at too high an altitude to intercept the glideslope and issued missed approach instructions; however, the pilot made no further communications to air traffic control. Radar data subsequently showed the airplane make a tight, right-descending turn to the south while at 1,600 feet msl and 211 knots. The airplane climbed to 1,900 feet msl and then descended. The airplane disappeared from radar when it was headed south-southwest at 1,200 feet msl. Witnesses saw the airplane rapidly descending almost vertically toward the ground.

No discrepancies were noted with the preflight inspection, start-up, taxi to the active runway, or run-up.  Shortly after takeoff the pilot reduced the throttle and revolutions per minute (rpm) to 25 inches of manifold pressure (MAP) and 2,500 rpm for best rate of climb.

The pilot was a light sport designated pilot examiner (DPE) and the purpose of the flight was for the FAA inspector to administer a recurring DPE flight proficiency flight check of the pilot. The airplane departed from a lake near the pilot\u2019s residence and crashed on the lake\u2019s perimeter road. A postcrash fire consumed the majority of the passenger cabin and the inboard portions of each wing. Impact damage was consistent with a near-vertical descent. The composite propeller was burned, however pieces of the propeller had fractured on impact and were found away from the wreckage, indicative of the engine producing power when it crashed. No evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomaly was discovered. A witness living on the lakeshore said the airplane was usually airborne when it passed his house, but on this departure the airplane was still on the water when it passed, and continued out of sight. There was a stand of trees, high brush, and a hill at the departure end of the lake, separating it from the road. There was no evidence that the airplane impacted the trees or the bank. The airplane's weight and balance was calculated using the pilot\u2019s and passenger's weights noted on their FAA medical certificates, 7.5 gallons of fuel predicated on a one-hour flight and 30-minute reserve, and zero baggage weight. The airplane's empty weight, gross weight, and center of gravity (CG) limitations were derived from the accident airplane's maintenance logbooks. The engine\u2019s fuel consumption was estimated from the engine manufacturer's specifications. Baggage weight used was zero, although remnants of fishing gear and other personal items were found in the burnt wreckage, and a survival kit as required by regulation. The airplane's estimated gross weight was 36 lbs over its maximum gross weight, and the center of gravity was near the forward CG limit. Witness statements and evidence suggest that the fire burned intensely for 30-40 minutes. A witness stated that the pilot and passenger were planning to take the airplane fishing after the flight check, which would have required an additional 1.5 hours flight time and additional fuel. It is likely the airplane had more than the minimal 7.5 gallons of fuel onboard used for the weight and balance calculation (it had a 27 gallon capacity), and probably had fishing and survival equipment as well, adding to its already over gross weight. The fact that the airplane took longer to become airborne than usual, and its over gross weight, suggest that the airplane was near the lake\u2019s shoreline and close to rising terrain when it finally became airborne, requiring a steep climb attitude. The lack of evidence of any mechanical problems along with the airplane\u2019s near vertical descent is consistent with a loss of control due to an aerodynamic stall shortly after liftoff.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain sufficient airspeed to avoid an aerodynamic stall during takeoff and his decision to fly the airplane over its allowable gross weight. Contributing to the accident was the airplane's excessive gross weight."

About 2 minutes after the descent clearance was issued, the owner/pilot requested a diversion to a different airport, due to low visibility at the original destination. The request was approved, a heading change to 360 degrees was issued, and about 4 minutes later, the airplane departed controlled flight, and impacted terrain.

With the bucket in the water, the pilot pulled the cyclic aft as the line became tight.

The helicopter subsequently started spinning right likely because the main rotor strike had severed the tail rotor drive shaft, and, after two or three turns, the pilot realized that he could not control the helicopter, so he rolled off the throttle, which stopped the spin. The helicopter then descended and contacted the water hard. The pilot determined that he had not taken into account that the river had moved the bucket downstream, and, as a result, the bucket was behind (not directly below) the helicopter, which caused the helicopter\u2019s nose to pitch down when the line became tight.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed during the nighttime landing.The airplane came to rest about 116 feet past the end of the runway and 140 feet to the right of the runway centerline.  A heavy skid mark was found on the runway associated with the inboard tire of the left main landing gear.  This tire was found deflated and showed wear consistent with a skid.  Upon exiting the runway, both engines ingested snow and sustained internal damage.  Examination of the left main landing gear brake system revealed that the inboard and outboard wheel speed tachometer wires were cross-connected.  Such a configuration would be likely to cause the antiskid system to use the inboard wheel speed to control the outboard braking, and vice versa.  In such a situation, it would be likely that when the inboard tire began to skid, the antiskid system would release the pressure on the outboard brake instead of the inboard brake. Examination of maintenance records indicated that both main landing gear units were replaced on the incident airplane in early February 2008.",

He stated that he smelled  \"smoke from the engine, or some kind of burning smell\", and that they then landed because something was wrong.

The manual mixture control had incurred damage, and dark deposits had been baked on to the throttle body, consistent with that of an engine having been operating very rich.

The pilot had earlier flown to a highway accident site in order to transport injured persons to the hospital.  During the attempted loading of the injured persons, the chin bubble of the helicopter was damaged, and consequently the flight was canceled.  The injured persons were ground transported by ambulance.  A mechanic was dispatched to the site and he encountered moderate rain and gusty winds while en route.  The mechanic made a temporary repair to the damaged area of the helicopter.  According to the mechanic, the pilot indicated the site was a flood area and with a forecast of more rain, he preferred to move the helicopter.  The mechanic suggested to the pilot that he relocate the aircraft locally to a school or hospital after first hovering after lift off and evaluating the weather.  The mechanic would then drive the pilot from the relocation site to the destination.  The pilot did not acknowledge his suggestion and made a walk-around inspection of the helicopter, and checked his flight charts for obstructions. The pilot started the helicopter and departed. There is no record that the pilot obtained a weather briefing by radio or by cell phone before departing the accident site. The wreckage was located the following morning.  Doxylamine, a sedating over-the-counter antihistamine used in sleep aids and multi-symptom cold relievers, was found in the pilot's blood on toxicological examination.  Pseudoephedrine, a decongestant available in many multi-symptom cold relievers, was also found in the pilot's blood.",
