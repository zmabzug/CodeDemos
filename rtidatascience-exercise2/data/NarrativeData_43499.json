After a few seconds, engine and rotor speed returned to normal. The engine manufacturer said it should be of no concern as long as it operated normally during flight, but suggested adjusting the linear variable differential transducer after they ferried the helicopter home. On the day of the accident, the pilot intended to make a low pass and land at a hospital helipad. He lowered the collective control and noticed rotor rpm had decreased to 96 percent. The LOW ROTOR RPM warnings activated. He realized he was too low to attempt an autorotation. He reduced collective and pitch attitude further. RPM drooped to 90 percent, and stabilized.  Approximately 20 to 30 feet above the helipad, the pilot raised the collective control to flare for landing. RPM rapidly deteriorated. The aircraft impacted the helipad in a tail-down position, rolled over, and came to rest on its left side. The operator found the rotary variable differential transformer rigged at 57.9 degrees of twist grip travel at the Flight Gate position.

While en route to their destination, the flight crew obtained the airport Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) information.  The ATIS information indicated the current winds were 060 degrees at 14 knots.  Neither the captain nor the first officer checked the reported winds against the Wind Component Conversion Chart to determine whether the headwind/tailwind and crosswind components were within limits.  The Wind Component Conversion Chart indicated that the tailwind component was 10.5 knots and the crosswind component was 9 knots.  The airplane's tailwind limitation is 10 knots.  The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data indicated that the airplane landed with a 13 knot tailwind.  Prior to the ILS instrument approach, the captain conducted an Approach Brief, but did not brief the missed approach procedures.  The tower air traffic controller informed the pilot that snowplows had removed snow from the centerline of the runway and that the braking action was \"fair to poor.\"  The captain did not brief the first officer concerning procedures for landing on a contaminated runway.  The FDR data indicated that the airplane touched down near the runway intersection, approximately 2,900 +/- 250 feet (2,650 feet to 3,150 feet) from the approach end of Runway 20.  Runway 20 is 7,000 feet long.  The desired touchdown point is 1,000 feet from the approach end of the runway, or the first 1/3 of the runway.  Runway 20's touchdown zone limit is 2,333 feet from the approach end of the runway.  The FDR data indicated that the aircraft touched down on a heading of 190 degrees at 124 knots computed airspeed with 0.4 degrees of nose up pitch.  The data indicated the nose was pitching nose down at the time of touchdown.  All three landing gear Weight-on-Wheels (WOW) switches changed from Air to Ground within 0.25 seconds of each other. Approximately 1.75 seconds later the nose landing gear WOW switched to Air again, indicating that the nose landing gear had collapsed. The vertical acceleration parameter did not show a significant load at touchdown.  The airplane skidded to a stop on the runway.  The captain reported that he inspected the runway and observed ridges of snow and ice near the runway intersection.  The on-site inspection of the airplane revealed that the nose landing gear drag brace had broken and the nose landing gear collapsed rearward.  The nose wheel and tire remained intact and were jammed under the airplane as it skidded to a stop. Metallurgical examination revealed that the drag brace failed due to the application of an overload and that there were no material defects.  The Messier-Dowty analysis of the nose landing gear fracture indicated that the load required to fracture the drag brace was generated by hitting an obstacle.  An investigation of airport operations revealed that the personnel inside the snow removal vehicles were making runway condition assessments by looking out their side view mirrors.  The airport did not conduct or provide friction measurement reports and NOTAMS between the hours of 1900 and 2200 when airport conditions were rapidly changing with significant snowfall accumulations and snow removal equipment was actively operating on runway 20.",

The pilot departed on a brief local flight with the fuel selector handle positioned to the left main fuel tank. About 10 minutes into the flight, the engine lost all power, and the flight instructor-rated passenger performed a forced landing to a field. During the landing, the airplane impacted a berm and sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the airplane\u2019s fuel selector handle was installed 180 degrees from its correct orientation. As such, when the handle portion of the selector was pointing at the desired tank, the pointer (arrow) was pointing in the opposite direction. Thus, when the pilot selected the left main fuel tank, the fuel selector valve was actually positioned to the right main fuel tank, which had little fuel at takeoff and was found empty after the accident. Additionally, the fuel selector handle was missing its roll pin, which allowed it to be installed incorrectly. Due to the fuel system design of return fuel going to the left main fuel tank only, the pilot primarily flew with the fuel selector positioned to the left main fuel tank. \u000b\u000bThe fuel selector handle was often removed and reinstalled during maintenance inspections to allow access to the floor boards in the cockpit. An airworthiness directive (AD) for the fuel valve required repetitive inspection of the roll pin fuel valve during annual inspections per a manufacturer service instruction, or replacement of the roll pin valve with a D-handle type valve. Review of maintenance records revealed that about 38 years prior to the accident, a logbook entry indicated that the AD was complied with by installing a D-handle fuel valve; however, a roll pin type valve was installed at the time of the accident. Maintenance personnel performing subsequent inspections would assume, per the logbook entry, that the D-handle valve had been installed and any maintenance reference to the roll pin valve would not be applicable. The mechanic that performed the most recent annual inspection stated that he was not aware of a roll pin. The mechanic added that during the annual inspection, he removed and replaced the fuel selector handle to the same position he had found it.

The airplane was registered to private individuals and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The private pilot and his passenger sustained fatal injuries. Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight. The cross-country flight originated from Tehachapi, California at 1643 with an intended destination of FCH. Preliminary information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that the pilot was receiving Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight following with Air Traffic Control (ATC). When the flight was about 10 miles south of the airport, the pilot notified ATC that he had the airport in sight. Subsequently, ATC cancelled flight following and approved the pilot to change frequencies. Multiple witnesses located adjacent to the accident site and airport reported observing the accident airplane enter the airport traffic pattern for runway 30. A witness located on the ramp area of the airport stated that the airplane initially captured his attention when it landed hard about midway down the runway then proceeded to takeoff. Witnesses observed the airplane continue on a northwesterly heading and maneuver for landing on runway 12, where they observed the airplane fly at a high rate of speed about 10 to 15 feet above ground level (agl). The witnesses stated that the airplane entered a climb about three-quarters down the runway and continued to the southwest where a series of turns were performed. Witnesses further stated that they then observed the airplane approach runway 30. Two witnesses located about mid-field of the airport reported observing the airplane fly along the runway about 100 feet agl, and noted that the left wing navigation light appeared to be inoperative. The witnesses stated that as the airplane neared the departure end of runway 30 at an altitude of about 400 feet agl, it rolled to the left and descended in a vertical attitude below their line of site behind a row of hangars.Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted terrain about 490 feet southwest of the departure end of runway 30. All major structural items of the airplane were located within about 50 feet of the main wreckage, except for a portion of the outboard left fiberglass wingtip. Numerous white paint chips, landing light lens cover fragments, and a portion of the left fiberglass wingtip was located about 1,406 feet southeast of the threshold of runway 30.

The left and right fuel sight gauges indicated 45 gallons and 55 gallons, respectively, which was \"sufficient\" fuel for the planned 1 hour 50 minute cross country flight.  During the flight, both engines lost power, and the pilot ditched the airplane in ocean waters about 8 nautical miles short of the destination airport.  Review of maintenance records indicated that about 4 months before the accident, fuel leaks in the airplane's left and right wings were repaired by replacing the right hand outboard and left hand inboard leading edge fuel cells.  This repair involved  replacement of both wing fuel sight gauges.  According to one of the two mechanics who performed the work, when the sight gauges were removed to replace the tanks, he and the other mechanic marked the sight gauges \"R\" and \"L\" and made hash marks on the mounting plates.  When they reinstalled the sight gauges, they used the hash marks to put them back in their original positions.  Interviews of the airplane's owner and another mechanic provided conflicting information about whether the fuel sight gauges had been repositioned by this mechanic following completion of the fuel cell repair work.  Review of the Pilot's Operating Handbook revealed that the fuel sight gauges are to be used for partial filling or off-loading of fuel and only when the gauge reads within the calibrated area between 40 and 60 gallons.  When the airplane was examined, the fuel tanks were empty.  The right wing fuel sight gauge indicated 55 gallons.  The left wing fuel sight gauge initially indicated in the cross hatched area; but after it was jiggled, it indicated 43 gallons.  When the fuel sight gauge access plates were removed, it was noted that black felt tip pen marks (hash marks) on the fuel sight gauge mount plates and on the fuel sight gauges did not align.  Further examination revealed that the gauges were installed improperly, such that the floats were restricted in their range of travel by the wing structure.  When the gauges were rotated to a position where the hash marks aligned, the gauge floats had a full range of travel, and both gauges indicated in the cross hatched (unusable) area.   Information provided by the airplane's owner and a trip book found in the airplane indicated that at the time the pilot conducted his preflight and at the time of the accident, the airplane had been flown 3.9 hours and 5.5 hours, respectively, since its last refueling.  Using the fuel burn rate provided by the owner of 30 gallons per hour, the airplane would burn 165 gallons of fuel in 5.5 hours.  Further, in the 3.9 hours flown by the owner, the airplane would burn 117 gallons.  Subtracting 117 gallons from the airplane's usable fuel capacity of 166 gallons indicated that when the pilot preflighted the airplane, it contained about 49 usable gallons of fuel with each wing holding about 24.5 usable gallons of fuel.  If the sight gauges had been properly installed, they would have read in the cross hatched (unusable) area.  The airplane was equipped with left and right fuel quantity indicators mounted in the instrument panel.  According to the owner, these indicators did not work properly and several maintenance facilities had worked on them without resolving the problem.  He and other family members who flew the airplane (including the accident pilot) used the sight gauges to determine the amount of fuel aboard the airplane for partial fuel loads.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to refuel the airplane which resulted in a dual loss of engine power during normal descent due to fuel exhaustion.  A contributing factor was the incorrect installation of the left and right wing fuel sight gage/float assemblies by unknown persons, resulting in a false indication on the wing fuel sight gages."

The previous owner saw that their total weight was greater than he had been told during an earlier inquiry and advised the flight instructor and the new owner that their total weight might put the airplane near its maximum allowable gross weight. He also advised them not to add any more fuel than was already onboard, and then handed them the weight and balance sheet for the airplane. Subsequently, witnesses saw the airplane take off and ascend at an extremely low rate of climb. When another pilot waiting to take off asked whether they were having any technical difficulties, the accident pilot responded that there was nothing wrong but that it was just a \u201cweak airplane.\u201d About 1/2 mile after passing the departure end of the runway, the pilot initiated a right turn but failed to maintain sufficient airspeed, resulting in the airplane stalling and descending into the terrain. The postaccident investigation determined that the airplane was being operated above its maximum allowable gross weight and that it was being operated in a density altitude that was 2,120 feet higher than the field elevation. An engine teardown examination determined that both of its carburetors had jet needles installed that produced a richer-than-normal fuel-air mixture. This was due to an incorrect reassembly after an overhaul of the carburetors.

Of the 25 passengers and crewmembers reported to be on board the airplane at the time of the accident, 23 were reportedly killed and two others were seriously injured.  The airplane was reportedly destroyed with no evidence of fire.  Daylight visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight crew had reportedly performed the emergency landing attempt because the airplane was experience technical problems during cruise flight.  The flight had departed from the city of N'djamena in Chad with passengers and cargo (onions and garlic) and was destined for Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo.

Subsequently, the airplane landed hard and came to rest upright. The pilot reported that he was going to participate in an air race and that the airplane was equipped with an anti-detonant injection (ADI) system that was designed to inject a methanol and water mixture into the engine at race power settings and was computer controlled. He said that the system was designed to engage when the engine manifold pressure reached a certain level and continue to a race power setting. The pilot stated that he typically armed the ADI system after takeoff during cruise flight; however, he decided to arm the system prior to takeoff. The pilot thought that after the ADI system activated during takeoff, it might have flooded the engine when he reduced engine power to maintain airspeed to allow him to retract the landing gear.

The pilot was advised of the possibility of turbulence and clouds along his route, which was primarily over mountainous terrain, with cloud tops forecast to be 25,000 feet and above. There were no records of any subsequent telephonic or computer weather briefings, and the pilot did not file a flight plan. Although the pilot did not communicate with air traffic control (ATC), ground-based ATC radar captured the majority of the flight. When the airplane was reported overdue by relatives of one of the passengers, the radar data were used to search for and locate the airplane, which had impacted terrain in a remote wilderness area about 110 miles from the departure airport. Evaluation of the radar data indicated that the total flight duration was about 1 hour and that the airplane was above 12,500 feet for about 28 minutes and above 14,000 feet for about 8 minutes. The last 2 minutes of radar data depicted a course reversal, followed by an erratic course and an irregular, rapid descent. Meteorological data indicated that broken or overcast cloud base altitudes ranged from about 7,000 to 10,000 feet, with tops near 28,000 feet and that icing conditions could be expected in the clouds above about 10,000 feet. Terrain elevations within 30 miles of the impact site ranged from about 4,000 to 7,000 feet. Wreckage patterns and ground scars indicated a near-vertical impact trajectory. A supplemental oxygen tank was present in the wreckage, but the tank inspection expired 8 years before the accident, and no hoses or masks were present. Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The radar ground track was consistent with the pilot trying to find a route clear of the clouds.

On the accident flight the airplane was being repositioned following a demonstration and the two pilots included a commercially licensed manufacturer's sales pilot and a private licensed regional sales distributor.  One of the two pilots onboard requested, and received, an abbreviated weather briefing prior to departure, the details of which included an airman's meteorological information notice (AIRMET) for occasional moderate rime ice. He then filed an instrument flight rules flight plan for a route passing over mountainous terrain, with a published Minimum En route Altitude (MEA) for the airway that was above the predicted icing level.  The flight plan was not activated and the pilots told a TRACON controller who was providing VFR advisories that they intended to continue under visual flight rules through a mountain pass and open their IFR flight plan after reaching the other side of the pass where the MEA was lower.  A review of the mode C reported altitudes flown by the pilots and an analysis of the cloud bases and tops revealed that the flight was likely in at least intermittent, if not mostly solid, instrument meteorological conditions as it flew through the pass.  As the flight approached the other end of the pass, the controller advised the pilots that the radar showed they were heading into rising terrain.  The controller asked, \"Do you have the terrain in sight?\"  One of the pilots responded, \"we're maneuvering away from the terrain right now.\"  After that, radar contact was lost.  Recorded radar data showed that the airplane made a right-hand turn toward rising terrain while continuing to climb to an approximate altitude of 8,800 feet mean sea level (msl).  The last minute of radar data showed the airplane at altitudes of 8,000 feet msl, 8,800 feet msl, and 8,600 feet msl.  The last radar return was at an altitude of 7,300 feet msl.  An aircraft performance study was accomplished using recorded radar data and aerodynamic data provided by Cessna.  Based on the radar data and other relevant information, as the aircraft turned toward the rising terrain, the bank angle steadily increased, until a very abrupt change in pitch consistent with a stall occurred, and the airplane departed controlled flight and descended at a very steep nose down attitude into the mountainous terrain.  The airplane wreckage was subsequently located at an elevation of 6,073 feet.  Nearby ground witnesses first noticed the sound of the airplane, that then suddenly changed to a high-pitched increasing rpm.  Witnesses then saw the accident airplane coming out of the clouds almost straight nose down.

The private pilot, and the two pilot rated passengers were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, which departed Darlington County Jetport (UDG), Darlington, South Carolina. According to witnesses, the private pilot had been having problems with the airplane's landing gear system and had been receiving a \"Gear Unsafe\" indication. Earlier on the day of the accident he was observed working on the airplane and when queried by one of the witnesses, the pilot advised him that he was troubleshooting an electrical problem.Later that day, the private pilot and one of the pilot rated passengers, departed UDG, flew around the local area \"for some time,\" and then landed at Hartsville Regional Airport (HVS), Hartsville, South Carolina. At 1510 the private pilot refueled the airplane with 50 gallons of fuel and then at approximately 1610 took off alone and returned to UDG. Sometime after returning to UDG, the private pilot took off again, this time not only with the pilot rated passenger he had been flying with earlier that day but, also with an additional pilot rated passenger.At approximately 1819, a relative of the private pilot received a text message asking him to come to HVS, as the landing gear would not come down. Then at 1836 he received a second message to \"Call 911.\" Around the time that the private pilot sent the text, a witness observed the airplane pass by him numerous times during an approximately 15 minute long period. The airplane was \"low\" to the ground. On the last pass, he could hear the airplane's engine running, and observed the airplane fly across HVS about midfield at 600 to 700 feet above ground level, bank sharply to the left, pitch up to about 25 degrees nose up, then descend rapidly in a nose high attitude until he lost sight of the airplane. Moments later, he heard the sound of impact, and observed a large fire ball and smoke.Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane had struck two trees before making ground contact, and coming to rest next to a row of trees. Multiple pieces of wood were present on the ground which exhibited evidence of propeller strike marks.Examination of the wreckage revealed that it had been exposed to a postcrash fire and that there was no evidence of any preimpact structural failure. The wing flaps were in the up position, and flight control continuity was established from the cockpit flight controls, to the breaks in the system which showed evidence of tensile overload and from the breaks in the system, to the mounting locations of the flight control surfaces. Examination of the propeller revealed evidence of S-bending, leading edge gouging, and chordwise scratching. Examination of the engine's single stage axial flow propulsor utilizing a borescope revealed evidence of rotational scoring and reverse bending on multiple turbine blades.Examination of the landing gear system revealed that the landing gear handle was in the down position however, the nose landing gear was in the \"up\" position. The left and right main landing gear were partially extended, and the left main landing gear leg was fractured into two pieces. Examination of the main landing gear doors indicated that the right main landing gear door was closed during the impact sequence and the left main landing gear door was open during the impact sequence. Examination of the hydraulic reservoir revealed it was not full, and only contained about 10 tablespoons of hydraulic fluid. During the examination, no leaks were discovered in the reservoir.Further examination of the wreckage also revealed that the seat cushion for the right rear seat was displaced from its normal mounting position and an access panel which was located beneath that mounting location, and which would allow access to the main landing gear actuators, had been removed. Examination of the panel revealed scratch and pry marks on its topside, near one edge, and an open jackknife was discovered on the floor in close proximity to the panel.",

He completed two aerial sightseeing flights and was making a third flight. The airplane was about 2 nautical miles from the airport, which was located on an island, when, following a left turn climbing maneuver, the engine began to surge. The pilot elected to perform a forced landing in the ocean. Despite the fact that the engine stopped surging and began producing \u201calmost takeoff power\u201d when the airplane was about 500 feet above ground level, the pilot opted to continue with the ditching. Upon impact with the water, the bi-wing airplane nosed over and sustained substantial damage to both left wings. After the airplane was recovered from the water, about 4 gallons of fuel and 16 gallons of sea water were drained from the 36-gallon capacity left fuel tank; there was no fuel in the 36-gallon right fuel tank. Neither fuel tank had been breached. During a postaccident examination of the airframe and engine, no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures were found that would have precluded normal engine operation. Given the low fuel quantity, it is likely that, during the left turn climbing maneuver, the fuel tank inlet was unported, and air was introduced into the system, which caused the engine surge. Once the climbing turn was stopped, normal fuel flow began and engine operation resumed.It was noted that the wires attached to the cork floats of each of the two fuel quantity sight gauges were bent and that this was causing the gauges to register a fuel quantity of 7/8ths, irrespective of the actual fuel quantity. It could not be determined if the wires were bent before the accident or as a result of the impact. If the wires were bent before the accident, then the pilot should have recognized that the indicated fuel quantity was not changing during the first and second flights of the day and should have taken further action to verify the actual fuel quantity aboard the airplane before initiating the accident flight. If the wires were bent as a result of the impact, then the fuel gauges would have been working properly, and the pilot should have noted the low fuel quantity and refueled the airplane before initiating the accident flight.",

He declared an emergency to an air traffic controller and initiated a slow descent to the nearest airport recommended by the controller. The pilot asked the controller if there was a mechanic at that airport and the controller stated that there was not but that a mechanic was available at another airport. The pilot elected to go to the other airport, which was farther away.The pilot acquired the airport visually but was initially a little high and planned to enter the traffic pattern on a downwind leg for the opposite runway; the pilot lowered the landing gear to assist in losing altitude. However, the airplane was then low and the airspeed was decreasing. The pilot subsequently decided to abandon the downwind approach and land straight-in to the runway. The oil pressure gauge indicated zero and the oil warning light illuminated. The pilot continued to run the engine until he thought he could reach the runway, and then he shut down the engine. He subsequently raised the landing gear as the airplane became low, but the airspeed also decreased. He realized that he was not going to reach the runway and lined up with a grassy area short of the runway to avoid colliding with the instrument landing system. He extended the landing gear and flaps and the airplane touched down and collided with a ditch.A postaccident examination of the engine assembly revealed that the right turbocharger would not rotate when actuated by hand. The turbocharger was removed and oil was noted in the compressor outlet tubing. Several of the blades were broken and some were bent near the tip in the direction opposite of rotation.

A witness, about 1/3 to 1/2 mile to the east of the airport, saw the airplane fly overhead at a very low altitude, then heard the engines rev up, and saw the airplane climb.  The airplane disappeared into the falling snow, and the witness then heard the sound of a crash.  Airplane wreckage was later found on rising terrain, about 1/2 nautical mile to the left of the runway's departure end.  The landing gear and flaps were up, and the elevator was trimmed for a climb.  Trees were initially cut at an ascending angle of about 5 degrees for approximately 50 feet, then a descending angle of about 5 degrees for another 250 feet.  The wreckage elevation was approximately the same as the decision height for the ILS approach.  There was no evidence of pre-accident mechanical failure. ",

The pilot reported that the instrument flight rules (IFR) flight had initially been operating above a broken to overcast cloud layer.  However, about the mid-point of the trip the flight encountered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and light rime ice.  The pilot stated that he requested a higher altitude in an attempt to avoid the icing conditions, but air traffic control cleared him to a lower altitude due to the flight's proximity to its intended destination.  The flight remained in IMC as it was vectored for an instrument approach.  At the missed approach point, the pilot did not have the airport in sight due ground snow cover and his unfamiliarity with the area.  He executed a missed approach.  While being provided with radar vectors for another approach, the pilot obtained visual contact with the airport.  When he entered visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, he cancelled the IFR flight plan and entered a traffic pattern for runway 36.  The pilot reported that on short final the airplane drifted left of the runway centerline.  He applied a little power in an attempt to get re-aligned.  The pilot stated:  \"The aircraft started rolling left.  I applied full power and attempted to abort my landing.  The aircraft engine responded but we completely rolled until inverted and subsequently made contact with the ground.\"  In a follow-up interview, the pilot stated that the aircraft had accumulated rime ice along the leading edges of the wings.  An AIRMET for occasional moderate rime or mixed icing below 10,000 feet mean sea level was in effect at the time of the flight.  A certified re-recording of the weather briefing was provided to the NTSB.  During the briefing, the pilot was informed of the AIRMET and of a pilot report of light rime ice along his route of flight.  The pilot had received his instrument rating seven weeks prior to the accident.  He reported 2.5 hours of actual instrument flight time and minimal experience with in-flight icing conditions.  Federal Aviation Administration publications state that ice formation on an aircraft's flight surfaces may adversely affect performance and control.

No flight plan was filed for the flight that originated at the Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE), Allentown, Pennsylvania, about 1230. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, he conducted a preflight inspection of the airplane, which included visually checking the total amount of fuel in each fuel tank. He stated there was about 25 gallons of fuel in the left-wing fuel tank and about 7 or 8 gallons in the right-wing fuel tank. The pilot said the engine started normally and he taxied to the runway where he performed an engine run-up. The engine run up was normal and he confirmed the fuel selector was on the left-wing fuel tank. The pilot said he then departed and flew to XLL for the purpose of practicing takeoffs and landings. On the fourth takeoff, about 30 minutes into the flight, when the airplane reached an altitude about 400 to 500-feet-above the runway, the \"engine quit.\" The pilot described the loss of power as an \"instantaneous stop with no warning or sputtering.\"  He then made a forced landing straight ahead and the airplane struck a wire-mesh fence that was supported with steel poles.An initial postaccident examination of the airplane was conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about 30 minutes after the accident.

About 1 hour 50 minutes into the flight the engine sputtered.  The pilot repositioned the fuel selector and engine power was restored then the pilot attempted to divert to a nearby airport.  While descending the engine quit.  After descending below the base of the clouds the pilot located a road and attempted a forced landing but the right wing collided with a fence.  The airplane then impacted the road and came to rest upright.  Post crash examination of the airplane revealed no fuel remaining in the fuel tanks with both fuel caps in place.  Fuel leakage was not noted at the scene.  Each fuel tank bladder was replaced within the preceding 6 years and the pilot replaced only the left fuel cap.  Examination of the right fuel cap revealed that the seal was cracked.  No abnormal wrinkles were noted in the fuel bladder cells and each bladder was secured by the top hangers. ",

The pilot opened the canopy, which then separated from the airplane, and exited the airplane. Due to the low altitude, the pilot\u2019s parachute did not fully deploy before he impacted the ground. The accident airplane was 1 of 14 MX-model airplanes. It was the only model built from a kit as an experimental, amateur-built aircraft, and it was constructed differently than the other MX-model airplanes. Postaccident examination of the torque tube assembly revealed that the forward bulkhead holding the torque tube assembly in place was constructed in a way that allowed the bulkhead to flex, which subsequently led the torque tube assembly to detach from the forward bearing during the accident flight and resulted in the loss of aileron and elevator control. Examination also revealed that the forward and aft bearing houses were installed opposite of the correct direction, which allowed the bearings to detach from the torque tube assembly when the front bulkhead flexed. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s inability to maintain control of the airplane following the loss of aileron and elevator control due to the forward flight control torque tube assembly\u2019s detachment from the forward bearing. Contributing to the accident was the inadequate construction of the forward bulkhead that held the flight control torque tube assembly in place and the improper installation of the thrust bearings. "
