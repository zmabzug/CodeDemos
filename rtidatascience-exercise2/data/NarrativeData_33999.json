Density altitude was 3,500 feet.  The takeoff flap setting was at least 10 degrees of flaps, although the Cessna 150 owner's manual recommends the use of 10 degrees flaps only for takeoff from soft or rough fields with no obstacles ahead.  According to the pilot-rated passenger, during the takeoff roll, the pilot 'kept the nose wheel at a high angle,' and the airplane 'lumbered' off the ground. After completing a left turn to avoid obstacles, the pilot added more flaps, and the airplane stalled and impacted the ground in a nose down attitude.  Although the pilot reported a gradual loss of engine power, the passenger did not, and an examination of the engine revealed no evidence of any mechanical discrepancies.  In the 90 days before the accident, the pilot had flown 64 hours;  however, 60 of these hours were in multi-engine airplanes, and only 2 hours were in a Cessna 150. ",

SUMMARY On October 25, 1999, about 1213 central daylight time (CDT), a Learjet Model 35, N47BA, operated by Sunjet Aviation, Inc., of Sanford, Florida, crashed near Aberdeen, South Dakota. The airplane departed Orlando, Florida, for Dallas, Texas, about 0920 eastern daylight time (EDT). Radio contact with the flight was lost north of Gainesville, Florida, after air traffic control (ATC) cleared the airplane to flight level (FL) 390. The airplane was intercepted by several U.S. Air Force (USAF) and Air National Guard (ANG) aircraft as it proceeded northwestbound. The military pilots in a position to observe the accident airplane at close range stated (in interviews or via radio transmissions) that the forward windshields of the Learjet seemed to be frosted or covered with condensation. The military pilots could not see into the cabin. They did not observe any structural anomaly or other unusual condition. The military pilots observed the airplane depart controlled flight and spiral to the ground, impacting an open field. All occupants on board the airplane (the captain, first officer, and four passengers) were killed, and the airplane was destroyed.",

During a pre-flight weather briefing and during two in-flight weather updates, the pilot was advised by flight service station weather briefers that VFR flight was not recommended along his route of flight.  The flight was receiving VFR flight following services, and the air traffic controllers working the flight also twice advised the pilot of deteriorating weather conditions ahead along his route of flight.  The pilot responded that if necessary, he would turn around.  Radar and radio contact with the airplane were subsequently lost due to the mountainous terrain.  Two witnesses located at different points along the intended route of flight observed the airplane flying southbound at an altitude of about 300 feet agl.  The first witness, located about 16 miles north of the accident site, reported that the ceiling was about 500 feet, and there was light snow and sleet falling.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.Two state biologists planned to conduct an aerial wildlife survey in a commercially-owned helicopter equipped with a three-abreast bench seat and a fully enclosed cabin. After briefing with the biologists, the pilot stowed most of the biologists' equipment and personal effects on the helicopter's external racks, and all three boarded the helicopter, with the biologists in each of the outboard seats. The plan was to conduct a fuel stop at one of the operator's fuel trucks located about 80 miles east of the departure airport, and then conduct the survey in the region near the fuel truck. The helicopter departed, and 6 minutes later, the state communications center received the first automated flight-following transmission.  About 33 minutes later, the pilot broadcast that the helicopter was \u201clanding at Kamiah,\u201d which was about 35 miles short of the planned destination.  An exact correlation between the time of the transmission and the accident time could not be determined, but the transmission was very likely within 4 minutes of the accident, and possibly much closer. No further transmissions were received from the helicopter. Several witnesses observed the helicopter transiting west to east, then heard unusual noises emanating from the helicopter and observed objects separating or falling from it. Several witnesses reported that it was rotating as it descended; one witness stated that the nose was \u201cdipping\u201d up and down, and other witnesses reported that the trajectory steepened as the helicopter descended.  The main wreckage was found in the driveway of a residence, and a 1,500-foot debris field was oriented back along the helicopter's flight path; some of the items at the beginning of the debris field included tail rotor blade and tail rotor gearbox segments, and fragments of a metal clipboard that belonged to one of the biologists. Witness marks on the tail rotor and clipboard clearly indicated that the clipboard struck and separated the tail rotor, which resulted in the loss of control of the helicopter. Helicopter geometry and aerodynamics suggested that the clipboard originated from the left side of the helicopter.The investigation was unable to determine why the helicopter diverted to Kamiah. One of the biologists was reported to be susceptible to airsickness. Anti-nausea wristbands were found in the external luggage, but they could not be definitively associated with any particular person on the helicopter. The landing diversion could have been to allow a biologist to access the wristbands, to prevent the biologist from getting sick in the helicopter, or to allow the biologist to discontinue the flight altogether. Other speculative reasons for the diversion include a problem with the helicopter, the need for one of the biologists to retrieve something other than the medication from the externally-stowed luggage, or the need to retrieve the clipboard that was inadvertently left unsecured on one of the external racks.  Because the fuel stop was planned to occur prior to beginning the survey, that stop would have provided the opportunity to retrieve any survey-related articles from the stowed luggage; thus it is unlikely that survey equipment was needed at that time. Aside from the clipboard-induced tail rotor system damage, examination of the helicopter and engine did not reveal evidence of any preimpact condition or failure that would have precluded normal operation or continued flight. There was no evidence that anyone actually got sick during the flight. Therefore, the landing diversion was likely either to provide an opportunity to somehow address the airsickness issue, or to retrieve the misplaced clipboard.It could not be determined whether the clipboard originated from inside or outside the cabin. If the clipboard were inside the cabin at the beginning of the flight, the only exit path would be via an open door. If a door were opened either intentionally or unintentionally, the clipboard could have exited either because it was near the door or because it was already resting on the bubble window at the time. Although one witness stated that the right cabin door was open in flight, the damage patterns indicated that both cabin doors were closed at impact. However, this does not mean that the door was not opened during the flight, and then closed during the descent.Although a witness stated that all external cargo items were secure before takeoff, it is possible that the clipboard was inadvertently left on an external baggage rack, went unnoticed until the helicopter was in flight, and was the reason for the diversion. Flight path data indicated that the helicopter was in a continuous climb until about 5 minutes prior to the accident. Since the cargo racks had mesh floors, the clipboard might have been held in place by the external airloads during the climbing portion of the flight and was only dislodged by altered airflow during the descent for the diversionary landing. Although two witnesses saw geese in the vicinity of the helicopter, there was no evidence of a bird strike. Several noteworthy safety-related discrepancies were revealed during the investigation, even though they did not directly contribute to the accident or its severity.  The genealogy of the helicopter could not be clearly established and remained suspect. Although the helicopter bore what appeared to be the manufacturer's original data plate, the accident helicopter configuration differed significantly from the as-delivered configuration, and there were no appropriate means of converting the as-delivered configuration to the as-found configuration. In addition, the helicopter was not in conformance with at least two contractual requirements regarding flight safety equipment. Finally, the state flight-following service, which was responsible for monitoring the progress of the flight, had to be prompted by the operator to determine the status of the flight after the helicopter disappeared from the operator's flight-following display.",
            "probable_cause": "In-flight impact of a passenger's metal clipboard with the helicopter\u2019s tail rotor, which resulted in destruction of the tail rotor and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

He assembled the glider with the assistance of the tow plane pilot and completed all post-assembly checks before they were joined by his copilot. The pilot and copilot then performed the before-takeoff checks outside the aircraft, confirmed operation of the tow release mechanism, and verified that the spoilers were closed. During the initial climb, the glider pilot noticed that the glider was not climbing, and he and his copilot, a more experienced glider pilot, discussed relative position to the tow plane in order to avoid wake turbulence and improve climb performance. About 200 feet above ground level and over the trees beyond the departure end of the runway, the glider pilot observed the tow plane's rudder \"waggle\" back and forth, and his copilot shouted, \"Release! Release! Release!\" The glider pilot released the glider from the tow plane and entered a left turn to the north for a forced landing on the divided highway east of the airport. The copilot joined him on the flight controls before the glider overshot the highway and collided with trees on the east side of the roadway.The tow plane pilot provided a similar recounting of the events. He explained that, before the flight, the proper signals for \u201ctoo fast\u201d or \u201ctoo slow\u201d were discussed but no others. He added that he had discussed signaling with the glider\u2019s copilot many times previously but that they had not recently discussed the rudder-wag signal, which means \u201ccheck spoilers.\u201d After takeoff, he noted that the tow plane\u2019s performance was as expected, but the climb rate was not. He checked the glider in his rearview mirror and noted that the spoilers were deployed. The tow plane pilot provided the internationally recognized (in the glider community) rudder-wag signal, and, instead of stowing the spoilers, the glider released from the tow.Postaccident examination of the glider revealed no mechanical deficiencies.  The pilot/owner stated that he knew the meaning of the rudder-wag signal, but responded to the callout from his copilot. He further stated that he believed the spoilers were stowed during preflight and before-takeoff checks, but he did not confirm that the control was locked in its detent prior to takeoff.",

The pilots reported hearing a loud bang and the indications on the No. 1 engine's rpm and engine pressure ratio gages dropped while the indication on the exhaust gas temperature gage increased.  The pilots retarded the No. 1 engine's power lever to idle and noted that the engine continued to run.  The pilots declared an emergency and requested to return to ATL.  While enroute back to ATL, the pilots shut down the No. 1 engine after the oil quantity had decreased to near zero and the oil pressure was less than 10 pounds per square inch.  The airplane returned to ATL for a single-engine landing without further incident.  The examination of the airplane revealed a large hole in the bottom of the No. 1 engine's cowl coincident with where the engine's fan duct was ruptured.  The disassembly and examination of the No. 1 engine revealed all of the 4th stage turbine blades were fractured transversely across the airfoil adjacent to the blade root platform.  There was one 4th stage turbine blade that had a flat, blue-colored, elliptical-shaped area on the fracture surface on the convex (suction) side of the airfoil that was identified by the NTSB's Materials Laboratory as a high-cycle fatigue (HCF) fracture.  HCF fractures at that location on JT8D-219 4th stage turbine blades are consistent with wear on the blade tip shroud notches that cause an increase in the stresses in the airfoil.  There is an airworthiness directive that requires an inspection of JT8D-219 4th stage turbine blades for shroud notch wear, however the incident occurred prior to the blades having accumulated enough time in service to have required the blades to be inspected.  All of the 4th stage turbine blades had the tip shroud notches repaired at Delta's turbine blade shop prior to installation in the engine.  Delta reported that they had seen an increase in the number of JT8D-219 4th stage turbine blade fracture incidents, almost all that involved blades that had been repaired in their blade repair shop.  As a result of the number of JT8D-219 4th stage turbine blade fracture incidents that had occurred, Delta had discontinued repairing those turbine blades in their shop and were using either new blades or blades that were repaired at a turbine blade repair facility.  Although a special dimensional inspection to measure the turbine blade's shroud notches was developed, there were no Delta-repaired 4th stage turbine blades available to measure.",
            "probable_cause": "The  4th stage turbine blade separation that resulted in an uncontained release of low pressure turbine blade material was Delta Air Lines' repair process for the turbine blades' tip shrouds.  It was not possible to identify the part of the repair process that led to the premature wear of the blade's tip shoud and subsequent separation."

Examination of the turbine engine revealed that it had experienced an uncontained separation of the second-stage turbine disk as a result of low cycle fatigue.  No evidence of deep scratches or gouges were observed on the bore surface or on the forward and aft face of the disk.  A review of maintenance records revealed that the engine had been previously installed on an aircraft that was registered in a foreign country, and the maintenance records were not complete.  When the operator purchased this engine, he informed the facility that performed his engine maintenance that the second-stage turbine rotor was installed on the engine in 1992 with a total of 730 cycles.  The maintenance facility then produced a new life-limit card for the second stage turbine disk.  Based on this data, the disk had accrued a total of approximately 1,738 cycles at the time it failed.  The rotor had an FAA approved life-limit of 5,400 cycles.

About 35 minutes into the flight, they heard a \u201cpop.\u201d They then scanned the instruments and noted that everything looked good. A short time later, they heard additional \u201cpop\u201d sounds. The pilot then began descending the airplane from 4,500 ft mean sea level (msl) to get under the clouds for a \u201cbetter visual,\u201d and, when the airplane was about 2,000 ft msl, the pilot increased the mixture control to full rich and turned the boost pump on. He then looked at the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) display and noticed that three of the cylinders \u201chad gone cold.\u201d The engine then began losing power and running roughly. At this point, he decided to divert, and, as he turned the airplane toward the diversion airport, the engine lost all power. The pilot decided to land on a road. After touching down, he headed the airplane off the road to the right to avoid a car, and the airplane went down the shoulder. The right wing got caught in the grass, which caused the airplane to veer right. The airplane then struck a barbed wire fence and was substantially damaged. \u000b\u000bReview of data stored in the onboard engine analyzer indicated that the cylinder head temperature and EGT for all of the engine\u2019s cylinders dropped over about a 5-minute period in the following order: No. 5,  No.3, No. 4, No.1,  No. 2, and No. 6, which is typically indicative of a fuel or ignition problem. However, examination and testing of the ignition system did not reveal any damage, unusual wear conditions, or evidence of significant contamination, and all of the ignition components successfully passed new part performance checks. No conditions were found that would have prevented normal ignition operation. Additionally, due to the duration of the loss of engine power and the fact that the ignition system had dual magnetos, it was unlikely that an ignition system problem caused the power loss. \u000b\u000bExamination of the fuel system revealed that, at the time of the accident, the airplane still had about 40 gallons of clean fuel onboard. Examination and testing of the fuel injection system and engine did not reveal evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions. After the examination of the engine and replacement of parts damaged during the accident, the engine was started and an engine test run was conducted with no anomalies noted.\u000b\u000bAccording to the airplane\u2019s flight manual, modern aircraft engines are extremely durable and seldom fail catastrophically without plenty of advance warning (lowering oil pressure, excessive mechanical noise, rising oil temperature, etc.). However, since none of these conditions were reported by the pilot and postaccident examinations of the ignition, fuel injection, and lubrication systems, as well as the mechanical components of the engine, determined that they were functional at the time of the accident, the reason for the engine failure could not be determined. \u000b",

The airliner was parked at the gate, and was boarding passengers for the Title 14, CFR Part 121 flight at the time of the mishap.  Another airline employee on the ramp saw the tug driver maneuver the tug toward the towbar, heard a loud noise, and saw the towbar buckle and \"go into the air.\"  The witness went to the nose of the airplane, and saw the tug \"going directly into the aircraft.\"  The witness did not notice whether the airline employee was sitting or standing in the tug, or whether she was looking forward or backward.  The tug struck the radome of the airplane, and the airline employee who was driving the tug was fatally injured after being trapped between the tug and the airplane.  The airline's tug had an open-air type cab.  Documentation of the tug and towbar revealed that the towbar was not engaged with the tug and had been pushed (jammed) into the tug as the tug moved toward the airplane. The tug was inspected and tested after the accident and no anomalies were noted with its operational capabilities.  Additionally, the tug had been operated several times earlier on the day of the accident with no problems noted.  The ramp conditions at the time of the accident were adequately illuminated and dry.  Passengers were still boarding at the time of the accident, and no urgency existed for the pushback.  The airline required a recurring practical evaluation of ground operational safety every three years.  An examination of training records, and interviews from airline personnel, revealed that the airline employee who was killed had not received pushback training since 1992, nor was she formally qualified or authorized to conduct pushback operations at the time of the accident. On the day of the accident, the airline employee was assigned bag room duties. The investigation could not determine how frequently or recently the airline employee may have operated the pushback tractor, or how familiar she may have been with its controls.    Ground operations staffing at the time of the accident included four employees, which was at a level consistent with the airlines' station staffing model range.  The investigation revealed that the staffing level had no direct bearing on this accident.  As a result of the accident, the airline used a pushback tug that was equipped with a protective enclosure over the driver cab, and the airline issued additional guidance in its ground operations manual regarding pushback operations, to include requiring an additional person to assist in connecting the towbar to the tug.( This case was modified on October 5, 2006 )",
            "probable_cause": "the airline ground person's failure to properly control the pushback tug, and her subsequent failure to maintain adequate clearance between the tug and the airplane.

The airplane was operating on autopilot with the autothrottles engaged.  The flight crew was able to restart the engines and a precautionary landing was made without further incident.  Examination of the airplane and its systems revealed no anomalies that could be attributed to the loss of power.  The weather conditions were consistent with the presence of ice crystals at the cruise altitude.  The engine inlet probes became blocked due to the ice crystals resulting in a false engine pressure ratio (EPR) indication and subsequent retarding of the throttles by the autothrottle system.  This is evidenced by the data from the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) which showed that the EPR indication increased while the airspeed decreased, the pitch attitude increased, the altitude remained the same, and the autothrottles had reached the EPR limit.  The DFDR data showed that the power reduction, the corresponding reduction in airspeed, and the increase in pitch occurred over the course of about 5 minutes prior to the roll back of the engines.  Over this time period, the airspeed dropped from 271.75 to 209.25 knots, and the pitch increased from 0.9 to 4.91 degrees.  The DFDR data also shows that during the 24 seconds after the roll back of the engines, the airspeed continued to drop to as low as 187 knots.  The only engine performance parameter recorded by the DFDR is EPR.  Interviews of the pilots show that their first indication of a problem occurred just before the airplane stalled.  The pilots also said in their interviews that engine anti-ice was not used prior to the loss of engine power.",

He stated that the pilot said he wanted the extra fuel as a safety precaution, but elected not to \"top-off\" the airplane.  According to the refueler, at the time he was refueling the accident airplane, the clouds were low, and there was light rain.  He further stated that he heard the two occupants of the airplane state that they had just flown from Pennsylvania, and they joked about being tired, and \"dragging\", after being in the airplane for such a long time. He further stated that they were concerned about leaving, and said about two or three times that they were too close to their final destination of Williston, Florida, and they did not want to stay in Gainesville, Florida.  According to an official with the FAA Gainesville Flight Service Station, the flight departed early Sunday morning, and during the departure, the pilot stated that he was \"departing VFR  to the south.\"  There was no further communications with the pilot of the accident airplane.

The helicopter drifted aft and to the left before it impacted the ground and rolled on its left side. The FAA inspector's attempts to recover the helicopter were unsuccessful.  According to the FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook, common errors when executing a power failure in a hover are; failing to use sufficient proper antitorque pedal when power is reduced, failing to stop all sideward and backward movement prior to touchdown, failing to apply up-collective pitch properly, resulting in a hard touchdown, failing to touch down at a level attitude, and not rolling the throttle completely to idle.  In addition, \"A helicopter is susceptible to a lateral rolling tendency, called dynamic rollover, when lifting off of the surface.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The Gulfstream was on an ILS instrument approach and the Beech was on a VFR approach.  Both airplanes subsequently landed without additional damage or injury to the occupants.  Upon initial contact with the air traffic control tower, the Beech C90 was instructed to make a straight-in approach to the runway and was given a transponder code.  The pilot miss-set the assigned code, which, due to an air traffic control computer software anomaly, caused the Beech's identifying data block to be suppressed and not available to the radar approach controller.  The approach controller attempted to provide traffic advisories to the overtaking Gulfstream pilot but could not determine the Beech's type, destination, or altitude.  (Altitude data became available to the controller 1 minute 14 seconds before the collision via a conflict alert message.)  The controller did not issue a traffic alert to the Gulfstream crew when the Beech's altitude became known.  Additionally, for unrelated reasons, the approach controller experienced frequent failures of his communication radio transmitter and was required to repeat transmissions to the Gulfstream and other aircraft.  Despite the traffic point-out, in front of them 1 mile, altitude unknown, and later at short distance at a known altitude near theirs, the Gulfstream flight crew did not visually identify and avoid the Beech nor did they request radar separation services.  On initial contact with the tower, the Gulfstream crew was cleared to land on the same runway the tower had previously cleared the Beech to make a straight-in approach to.  When asked by the Gulfstream if there was any traffic in their vicinity, the tower replied, \"nothing reported.\"  The tower controller realized his mistake approximately 16 seconds later, however, the collision had already occurred.  The Gulfstream pilot reported there were no TCAS 2 traffic advisories within 3 miles and there were no resolution advisories.  The Gulfstream first officer recalled a TCAS \"traffic\" advisory close by at near their altitude, but no annunciation in the minute or two before the collision.  With the model TCAS aboard the Gulfstream, when the aircraft's landing gear is extended, the lower TCAS antenna goes into an omni-directional mode wherein targets detected on the lower antenna only are displayed to the flight crew on the cockpit TCAS display with a text message of range and delta altitude but no bearing information.  The Beech's transponder antenna was on the lower fuselage and airframe structure shielded it from interrogation by the Gulfstream's TCAS.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot to correctly set a new transponder code and an anomaly in ATC software that precluded the controller from manually overriding the resulting inhibition of displayed data.  Factors in the accident were impaired function of the collision avoidance system in the other airplane due to structural masking of the airplane's transponder antenna, an intermittent failure of the approach controller's communication radio transmitter which interfered with his ability to communicate traffic information to the flight crew of other airplane, the failure of both the approach controller and the tower controller to issue safety alerts when the traffic conflict became apparent, and the failure of the flight crew of the other airplane to maintain an adequate visual lookout to see and avoid the airplane."

Opening the door in flight would require significant force to overcome the wind pressure.  The deceased passenger sat by herself next the emergency exit.  The passengers in the seats immediately ahead of the emergency exit said they heard a loud sound, like rushing air, behind them and knew this wasn't normal.  They thought they felt the wind, and one passenger turned to look over his right shoulder.  He saw the deceased passenger with her shoulders out of the door.

On the takeoff roll and initial climb from a 4,670-foot runway, witnesses heard the engine sputtering, missing, and backfiring.  An additional witness on the airport reported that his attention was drawn to the runway by \"snap\" and \"pop\" sounds from the engine.  When he looked toward the noise, he saw the accident airplane about midfield.  It sounded to him as if the engine were running lean.  The airplane lifted off the ground and appeared to climb out slowly.  He then heard the engine \"snap\" and \"pop\" again, which occurred a couple of times with about 2 to 3 seconds between each cycle.  The abnormal engine sounds stopped, and the airplane climbed for an additional 5 seconds before the nose pitched up about 10 degrees.  The witness then saw the airplane develop a high sink rate with an increasing nose up pitch attitude.  Witnesses said the airplane remained in a nose high, wings level attitude until just before it dropped behind a tree line when the right wing dropped and the airplane hit the ground.

According to the operator, the flight instructor had been counseled not to fly in that particular area at night because it was dark with no ambient surface light to illuminate the area. The flight school had other approved areas designated for night training flights. It is likely that the pilots were practicing a tracking or intercepting maneuver while not adequately monitoring the environment, which lacked illumination, to maintain sufficient altitude as they approached mountainous terrain.

As the airplane approached the destination airport, about 800 feet agl over a city, the engine began to run rough and lose power.  In an attempt to restore engine power, the pilot confirmed that the fuel selector valve was placed to the right fuel tank, and momentarily placed the auxiliary fuel boost pump in the high boost position.  Engine power was momentarily restored, followed by a complete loss of power. The pilot selected a forced landing area adjacent to several baseball fields.  During the forced landing approach, the airplane passed over four occupied baseball fields.

A Safety Board meteorologist reported that an evaluation of surrounding weather at the time of the accident indicated clear skies.  Post accident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any control or powerplant malfunctions.  The pilot had severe coronary artery disease noted on autopsy and a history of Type II diabetes which had not been revealed to the FAA.

The pilot attempted to cross-feed fuel from the left tank and he set the auxiliary pumps to LOW.  He saw no indication on the fuel gauge of a decrease in the left tank, and the right tank gauge continued to show a decrease in fuel. The right engine lost power; he secured the engine and feathered the propeller. Shortly thereafter, the left engine lost power. Air traffic control provided vectors to the nearest airport and the pilot managed to glide to the airport, landing gear-up on the runway.  A Federal Aviation Administration inspector responded to the accident site and found 12 ounces of fuel in the right fuel tank. The left fuel tank had ruptured with significant fuel staining evidenced on the ground under the left wing.  An inspection of the airplane's fuel system revealed a leak at the flexible rubber fuel hose/hose clamp at the right fuel valve.  No anomalies were found in the fuel system for the left engine. The fuel system has left and right main fuel tanks in wet wings that supply their respective engines in normal flight.  An auxiliary fuel pump, located outside the tank in line between the tank and the fuel selector valve, provides fuel pressure for priming during engine start and to purge fuel vapor from the lines when necessary. In the event of an engine-driven fuel pump failure, the auxiliary pumps can provide adequate fuel for engine operation. The engine-driven fuel pumps are the main pumps for the system and draw fuel by suction from the tanks through the fuel valves. Two fuel selector handles in the cockpit move the fuel valves in the wings and have positions for each main tank, cross feed, and off.  During normal flight, the left selector valve is positioned to the left tank and feeds the left engine, while the right selector valve is positioned to the right tank and feeds the right engine.  Fuel may be cross-fed from either main tank to the engine(s) by positioning both selector valves to the desired fuel tank.  With a fitting leak on one valve, a cross-feed selection for both engines could introduce air into the operating engine's fuel lines.

The engine functioned within acceptable parameters when installed in a test cell.  The Cockpit Voice Recorder revealed that the crew planned for the use of differential power in order 'to keep it on the runway.' ",
            "probable_cause": "The flightcrew's inadequate compensation for wind conditions.  A factor associated with the accident was a crosswind. "

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various entities, including, but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration and/or the operator and did not travel in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft accident report.The 54-hour private pilot landed at the airport at approximately 2100, under dark night conditions.  The pilot reported that he began to look for taxiway centerline markings, but none were found.  The pilot added that he then began looking for an aircraft marshaller while taxiing to the Fixed Base Operator parking area.  The pilot did not see any aircraft marshaller present and elected to continue to taxi to a parking spot.  While maneuvering the airplane near the parking area, the pilot initiated a left turn when he  felt the right wing impact a solid object.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the right wing impacted an unmarked black light pole near the parking area.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain adequate visual lookout during taxi.  Contributing factors were the dark night conditions, the unmarked light pole, and the lack of taxiway centerline markings at the parking area."
