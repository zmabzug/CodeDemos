About 1 1/2 hours before the accident, the pilot received a weather briefing that indicated expected sky conditions along the route were overcast 300-600 feet above ground level (AGL) and a present sky condition at the destination airport of an overcast ceiling at 400 feet AGL.  The pilot did not file an alternate airport as required by Federal Aviation Regulations which require that the ceiling be at least 2,000 feet AGL for at least 1 hour before and for 1 hour after the estimated time of arrival.  Sky conditions at the destination airport remained unchanged at the time the airplane was cleared for the approach.  The approach minimum, for an aircraft with DME capability, was 410 feet above touchdown elevation.  Radar track data for the airplane approach profile was consistent with a controlled approach.  The wreckage path through the tree was consistent with a level flight attitude in a direction along the inbound approach course.  Additionally, the airplane was configured with the landing gear extended and the flaps extended to 15 degrees, a configuration consistent with an initial approach configuration.  No anomalies were noted with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.  Advisory Circular information cites the operation pitfalls in aeronautical decision making of \"Get-There-Itis\" and Duck-Under Syndrome.\"  The pilot received an Authorization For Special Issuance Of A Medical Certificate, which stipulates the following conditions for its validity, \"You must promptly report any adverse changes in your medical condition or medications to the FAA Medical Appeals Section, AAM-313.  You are cautioned to abide by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR's), Section 61.53, relating to physical deficiency, medication, or treatment.  Because of your cardiac history, operation of aircraft is prohibited at any time new symptoms or adverse changes occur or if you experience side-effect, or require a change in medication.\"  The pilot was reportedly having palpitations for 20 minutes at a time for the two months prior to the accident and noted being \"tired\" within a week of the accident, but there is no evidence that he sought medical treatment for the fatigue or palpitations. The investigation could not determine if the pilot's physical condition was a factor in the accident flight.",
            "probable_cause": "The improper judgment by the pilot to conduct a flight to, and execute an approach to, an airport with weather conditions that were below the required minimums.  Also causal was the pilot's continued descent below the approach minimum descent altitude.  Contributing factors were the below approach landing weather minimums,  the night light conditions,  and the lack of a planned alternate airport by the pilot."

The commercial pilot performed an extensive pre-flight inspection before he departed on its first post-maintenance flight and found no anomalies. Shortly after takeoff, as the pilot retracted the landing gear, the hydraulic pump stopped and the \"gear-up\" light did not illuminate. He then tried to extend the gear and nothing happened. The pilot referenced an inspection mirror on the right wing and realized all three landing gear were dangling between the up and down positions. The pilot stabilized the airplane and used his cell phone to call Cessna Aircraft Company. An engineer provided troubleshooting techniques, but the pilot was unable to secure the gear in the down-and-locked position. The pilot then made a partial gear-up landing, which resulted in substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer. The airplane had been modified under a Supplemental Type Certificate in 1987, which removed the main landing gear doors and replaced them with fairings. As a result, some of the landing gear hydraulic lines were capped. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector performed an examination of the airplane and found a hydraulic line in the landing gear system that was not properly capped and was leaking. The line was re-capped and several gear extension/retraction tests were successfully performed. The uncapped line should have been found and repaired during the annual inspection.",

When the airspeed increased to 95 mph (blue-line on the airspeed indicator), the airplane suddenly yawed to the right and the airspeed decreased. The pilot said it, \"felt like my right engine stopped working.\"  In 3 to 4 seconds, the airplane was over a row of hangars.  The pilot lowered the nose of the airplane in an attempt to gain airspeed.  But, there was insufficient altitude to clear the hangars and subsequently the airplane collided with one of them, then impacted two parked aircraft.  Examination of the right engine revealed that the mixture control cable was disengaged from the carburetor mixture control arm and the cotter pin used to secure the tension nut on the mixture cable was not installed.  The mixture control swivel, stud, and a segment of the mixture control cable were examined at the NTSB's Material's Laboratory, Washington DC.  According to a Safety Board metallurgist, examination of some of the components indicated wear damage.  But, the mixture control cable did not exhibit any longitudinal gouge marks or wear damage that would have been consistent with it being separated during the accident sequence.  In addition, the engine was test-run and it operated at various power settings up to 1,500 RPM. The engine ran continuously and without hesitation for approximately 10 minutes.

He exited the aircraft and noted brake fluid leaking onto the ground and smoke coming from the right wheel brake.  He called for fire equipment and was walking to a ramp fire extinguisher when the right brake ignited.  FAA inspectors subsequently reported that the right main landing gear had been involved in a fire which consumed the tire and wheel fairing, and burned a hole in the wing above.  The left main landing gear and wheel, which did not burn, showed evidence of high temperature.  The brake caliper was leaking fluid, the brake disk was distorted and discolored, and the tire sidewall was heat damaged in the area adjacent to the brake disk.  The pilot attributed the fire to the parking brake master cylinder or parking brake linkage failure causing a minor binding of brakes.   A lineman at the flight's point of origin reported having to help the pilot start the engine and that he could hear the brakes dragging as the aircraft taxied away. ",

The pilot and passenger, wearing parachutes, elected to parachute to the ground. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the pilot leave the airplane approximately 10 to 15 seconds after the passenger departed and after placing the airplane in a nose dive. The airplane impacted a rectangular farm field and the pilot and passenger suffered serious injuries due to the low altitude in which they parachuted from. The airplane had been purchased by the accident pilot approximately one month prior to the accident. According to the airplane's engine maintenance log, on April 28, 2004, the engine had undergone a preservation process called \"pickling.\" The process utilized 10 quarts of pickling oil and the engine was placed in storage. On May 9, 2006 the engine was drained of the pickling oil and replaced with 7 quarts of 50 WT oil. The cylinders were drained and cleaned, and then the engine was test ran. The NTSB Materials laboratory examined components of the engine and analyzed an unknown substance within the lubricating journals of the camshaft and crankshaft. The compounds of the unknown substance was those found in corrosion preservation fluids also known as pickling fluids and are not found in lubricating oil. The presence of these compounds indicates that it was likely that some pickling fluids were still in the engine at the time of the accident; however, a specific pickling fluid could not be determined. According to the engine manufacturer, pickling fluid has been known to clog lubrication channels by forming a tarry residue when present in engines for prolonged periods and result in oil starvation. The number 2 main bearing and piston were thermally damaged and that thermal damage is consistent with oil starvation. Therefore it is possible that the residual pickling fluid clogged the lubrication channels for the number 2 position resulting in oil starvation.",

The horizontal stabilizer remained at approximately 1 degree airplane nose-up which resulted in excessive cockpit control forces. An emergency was declared with air traffic control and the flight landed uneventfully on runway 27R at ATL. The inoperative horizontal stabilizer trim system was caused by improper overhaul of the horizontal stabilizer chain drive unit drive assembly (horizontal stabilizer drive assembly) P/N AJH 7337-507, S/N DCA-418 by omission of one pin (P/N 3D0009-5-4), one nut (P/N MS21043-08), and one washer (P/N NAS 1252-BL) which secure the drive gear of the horizontal stabilizer drive assembly. The omission of the parts resulted in fatigue failure of another pin (P/N AJH7378-1) and shear failure of the single installed pin (P/N 3D0009-5-4).

Shortly after reaching its assigned altitude of 7,000 feet above mean sea level, the pilot advised the FAA controller, '...we have an engine problem.' The problem was not identified during a subsequent radio transmission. Shortly after the pilot's last radio transmission, witnesses on the ground observed the airplane in a counterclockwise flat spin. The on-scene examination revealed the left engine had suffered a mechanical failure. Continuity of the flight, engine, fuel and propeller controls was established.  An oil film was found on the left engine's nacelle, inboard half of the wing, left side of the fuselage and the horizontal stabilizer and elevator. The left engine case had fractured near the number 2 cylinder. Examination of the case fracture surfaces revealed fatigue failure at its initiation point.  The fatigue extended about 7 inches from its origin. Additionally, the number 2 cylinder connecting rod had separated from the crankshaft journal. Maintenance records showed the engine had a crankcase crack that was not covered by an FAA Airworthiness Directive or engine manufacturer specifications. The maintenance personnel informed the pilot about the crack. Examination of the airplane's hangar floor revealed a pool of fresh oil beneath the area where the left engine would have been positioned. Oil-based tire imprints made by the left main landing gear tire were found on the hangar floor that lead from the oil pool to the ramp outside the hangar.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.!! NOTE: THIS REPORT WAS MODIFIED ON JANUARY 10, 2006. !!The airplane was destroyed by impact forces.  There was no evidence of fire.  Wreckage examinations and all recovered wreckage from the impact area revealed no evidence of an in-flight collision or breakup, or of external contact by a foreign object.   An examination of the engine and the propeller indicated that the engine was producing power at impact.  The recovered components showed no evidence of preexisting powerplant, system, or structural failures.  Wreckage examinations showed crushing and bending consistent with a moderate angle of descent and a moderate right-wing-down attitude at impact.  The amount of wreckage recovered indicates that all parts of the airplane were at the crash site.  The wreckage was scattered over an area of about 600 feet.   An examination of radar and airplane performance data indicated that the accident airplane initiated a descent from 3,000 feet immediately after the accident pilot was given a second traffic advisory by air traffic control.  The pilot reported that the traffic was above him.  At the time the pilot stated that he needed to deviate, data indicate that the accident airplane was in or entering an uncontrolled descent.   Radar data indicated that, after departure from the airport, the closest identified airplane to the accident airplane was a DC-10, which was at an altitude of about 4,000 feet.  The horizontal distance between the two airplanes was about 1.1 nautical miles, and the vertical distance between the airplanes was about 1,600 feet.  The accident airplane was never in a location at which wake turbulence from the DC-10 would have intersected the Cessna's flightpath (behind and below the DC-10's flightpath).  Given the relative positions of the accident airplane and the DC-10, wake turbulence was determined to not be a factor in this accident.  Although the DC-10 was left of the position given to the pilot by Mobile Terminal Radar Approach Control, air traffic controllers do not have strict angular limits when providing traffic guidance.  The Safety Board's airplane performance simulation showed that, beginning about 15 seconds before the time of the pilot's last transmission (\"I needed to deviate, I needed to deviate\"), his view of the DC-10 moved diagonally across the windscreen from his left to straight in front of the Cessna while tripling in size.  The airplane performance simulation also indicated that the airplane experienced high bank and pitch angles shortly after the pilot stated, \"I needed to deviate\" (about 13 seconds after the transmission, the simulation showed the airplane rolling through 90\u00b0 and continuing to roll to a peak of about 150\u00b0 3 seconds later) and that the airplane appeared to have nearly recovered from these extreme attitudes at impact.  Performance data indicated that the airplane would had to have been structurally/aerodynamically intact to reach the point of ground impact from the point of in-flight upset.  There was no evidence of any other aircraft near the accident airplane or the DC-10 at the time of the accident. Soon after the accident, U.S. Coast Guard aircraft arrived at the accident scene.  The meaning of the pilot's statement that he needed to deviate could not be determined.  A review of air traffic control radar and transcripts revealed no evidence of pilot impairment or incapacitation before the onset of the descent and loss of control.  A sound spectrum study conducted by the Safety Board found no evidence of loud noises during the pilot's last three radio transmissions but found that background noise increased, indicating that the cockpit area was still intact and that the airspeed was increasing.  The study further determined that the overspeed warning had activated, which was consistent with the performance study and extreme fragmentation of the wreckage.  Radar transponder data from the accident airplane were lost below 2,400 feet.  The signal loss was likely caused by unusual attitudes, which can mask transponder antenna transmissions.  A garbled transponder return recorded near the DC-10 was likely caused by the accident airplane's transponder returns masking the DC-10's returns (since the accident airplane was projected to be in line between the DC-10 and the ground radar) or by other environmental phenomena.  Red transfer or scuff marks were observed on many pieces of the airplane wreckage, and these marks were concentrated on the lower airframe skin forward of the main landing gear and the nose landing gear area.  The Safety Board and four laboratories compared the red-marked airplane pieces to samples of red-colored items found in the wreckage. These examinations determined that most of the red marks were caused by parts of the airplane, cargo, and items encountered during the wreckage recovery.  The marks exhibited random directions of motion, and none of the marks exhibited evidence of an in-flight collision with another aircraft.  A small piece of black, anodized aluminum found embedded in the left wing was subsequently identified as a fragment from a cockpit lighting dimmer.  The accident occurred at night, with the moon obscured by low clouds.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, although visual conditions were reported between cloud layers.  The terminal aerodrome forecast reported a possible cloud layer at 3,000 feet.  Weather data and observations by the DC-10 pilot indicated that, after flying about 100 to 500 feet above the cloud layer and soon after sighting the DC-10, the accident airplane would have entered clouds.  A number of conditions were present on the night of the accident that would have been conducive to spatial disorientation.  For example, no visible horizon references existed between the cloud layers in which the pilot was flying because of the night conditions.  In addition, to initiate a visual search and visually acquire the DC-10, varying degrees of eye and head movements would have accompanied the pilot's shifting of attention outside the cockpit.  Once the DC-10 was visually acquired by the pilot, it would have existed as a light source moving against an otherwise featureless background, and its relative motion across and rising in the Cessna's windscreen could have been disorienting, especially if the pilot had fixated on it for any length of time.  Maneuvering the airplane during this search would likely have compounded the pilot's resultant disorientation.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's spatial disorientation, which resulted in loss of airplane control.  Contributing to the accident was the night instrument meteorological conditions with variable cloud layers."

No damage was incurred during that event. Examination of the airplane after the off-airport landing revealed that the gascolator screen was almost completely plugged by a flaky, shellac-type material. The airplane had a history of automotive fuel use, and the inspector who examined the airplane told the pilot that he should have a local mechanic do a thorough fuel system evaluation and flushing before further flight. He reminded the pilot that there were screens in the fuel tanks, carburetor, and in the belly sump that should be checked and cleaned. On the day of the accident flight, the pilot and a local mechanic added fuel to the right fuel tank and performed fuel flow tests. The pilot then attempted to take off, and the engine stopped producing power. The airplane impacted the ground in a left turn and nosed over. Examination of the airplane after the accident revealed that the carburetor and gascolator screens were 50 percent obstructed. Neither the pilot nor the mechanic indicated in their postaccident statements that the gascolator, carburetor, or fuel tank screens were checked or that the fuel system was flushed to remove the residual fuel system contaminants. Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the engine power loss was due to the obstruction of the fuel system screens, which prevented adequate fuel flow to the engine.",

The pilot advised the ATC controller that his \"engine was fine, but that his battery was draining\" and that he may \"lose radio communication.\" Shortly afterwards, the airplane began to deviate from its assigned course and heading until radio communications and radar contact were lost. A witness in the area of the accident stated that the airplane \"flew over his home and made two circles in approximately 30 seconds.\" The witness added that \"the airplane sounded very close, and the engine sounded normal,\" before he heard the airplane impact the ground. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact failures or malfunctions. Toxicological testing of tissue specimens from the pilot detected butalbital, (a prescription barbiturate typically used for severe headaches) bupropion, a prescription antidepressant also used for smoking cessation, and ethanol. The butalbital detected was consistent with use within 24 hours before the accident, and studies have shown butalbital can impair a pilot's ability to fly; however, the actual level of butabital in the pilot's system could not be determined because of the lack of fluids. It was not possible to estimate from the toxicology when the bupropion might last have been used, but this medication has been associated with an increased seizure risk. No fluids were available for analysis, so it could not be established whether the ethanol found was from ingestion. The pilot, a physician, had a history (known to the Federal Aviation Administration) of alcohol abuse, but the pilot did not note the use of any medications or any medical conditions on his most recent Application for Airman Medical Certificate.

The flight purpose was to practice takeoffs and landings on the student's eighth solo flight.  Two witnesses were at the Farm Exposition grounds, located adjacent to, and at the departure end, of runway 31 at Mefford Field.  They noticed that the wing flaps were extended to what was believed to be the full down position.  They saw the airplane climb straight out until it reached what was estimated to be 200 to 250 feet above the ground.  One witness noticed the airplane begin a turn to the left, in a westerly direction, and saw the nose come up to a higher attitude.  He remarked that the airplane was going to stall.  Shortly thereafter, the witness saw the airplane snap to the left, make one complete rotation to the left, with the left wing slightly lower of the right, and disappear behind some buildings.  The second witness, who is a certificated pilot, was conversing with the first witness.  He turned to speak to the first witness, who remarked, \"It's going to stall.\"  When he turned back to look, the airplane had disappeared behind the buildings.

The cockpit flap switch was operated, and the switch locked in the up position when activated.  The flap fuse was removed and tested.  It was shown that the fuse had continuity.  Power was applied to the wing flap motor using a 12-volt battery and electrical leads.  The motor ran and moved the wing flap jackscrew throughout its range of motion in both directions.  The flight instructor who had completed all of the pilot's training was interviewed.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The amateur-built, experimental, high-performance airplane was fueled to capacity and the pilot had planned a cross-country flight. During an initial takeoff, the airplane climbed to about 60 feet above ground level (agl) before touching back down; the pilot transmitted to the air traffic controller that he had a problem. The controller asked if the pilot needed any assistance, and the pilot responded that he was going to taxi back and \"see if I can figure it out,\" indicating that there was not a catastrophic failure and the pilot was intending to troubleshoot the problem. The pilot then taxied to a ramp area where the airplane was stationary for almost a minute and a half. Although the pilot's actions during this period are not known, it is likely that he was attempting to troubleshoot a problem with the airplane because the recorded engine parameters are consistent with the pilot cycling the propeller. Thereafter, the pilot stated his intention to stay in the traffic pattern, and he taxied the airplane back to the runway. The airplane became airborne about 18 seconds into the takeoff; the pilot then made a request to turn back to land. The airplane turned to the left and continued to climb until it reached its peak altitude of about 320 feet agl. Witnesses indicated that the airplane then entered a spin, completed about one revolution, and impacted terrain in a nose-low attitude before coming to rest in a dirt area between the parallel runways. A fire started upon impact. At the peak of the airborne portion of the first rejected takeoff, about 5,860 feet of runway remained. When the pilot made the request to turn back to land during the second takeoff, over 5,160 feet of runway remained, but because the airplane was 260 feet higher and had a higher airspeed than previously, the pilot likely thought he would not be able to land on the runway surface straight ahead. A performance study indicated that the airplane experienced a loss of thrust during the accident takeoff about 1 second before the pilot's request to return. Postaccident examination revealed no evidence of a preimpact uncontained engine failure, inflight fire, or flight control system malfunction. Fuel system continuity could not be confirmed due to thermal damage incurred during the postcrash fire. Review of the engine parameters revealed that, during the accident takeoff, the greatest anomaly in the airplane's parameters was that the fuel pressure dropped to a minimum psi while the fuel flow increased and the torque delivered to the engine shaft (Q) increased excessively. Shortly thereafter, fuel pressure recovered when the fuel flow reduced and Q retarded to an idle setting. Q also dropped to an idle setting during the previous takeoff. The reason for these variations could not be explained. In comparing prior flights to the accident flight, the maximum Q attained during takeoff climb was lower than the Q for the accident takeoff, and the fuel pressure did not drop to the same level as during the accident flight, which are indicative of a problem with the airplane.The airplane was equipped with a Turbine Starter Limiting/Monitoring System, capable of limiting power by restricting fuel flow, which was designed to act as a start sequence controller, an engine protection limiter, and an engine monitor/recorder. It is possible that this system/installation malfunctioned and engaged during the accident takeoff; however, the system was destroyed in the postcrash fire and could not be examined. Consequently, no determination regarding its performance during the accident flight is possible.The data showed that the pilot's most recent flight in the airplane was 6 days before the accident, at the same airport. During that flight, he also performed an initial rejected takeoff, suggesting that he was possibly having problems at that time; he made a successful flight thereafter, but remained in the traffic pattern. A simulation of the accident flight indicated that, during the airplane's left turn, the angle of attack at which the wing stalls was exceeded. A former engineer and general manager of the kit manufacturer stated that if the engine failed during takeoff, the airspeed would rapidly decay, and the pilot would have to push the nose down to maintain flying speed. He noted that following a loss of power, the nose would remain in a nose-up attitude, and unless the pilot made corrective pitch inputs (reducing the angle of attack) within about 4 to 5 seconds, the airplane would rapidly reach a critical angle of attack and stall, which would result in the wing simultaneously dropping. It would not be possible to recover from the stall at altitudes below 1,500 ft agl.Based on the results of the simulation for the accident flight, witness statements, statements from a former employee of the kit manufacturer, it is likely that pilot was attempting to return to a runway (either the takeoff runway or the parallel runway). The pilot did not push the nose down to maintain flying speed and stalled the airplane well below 1,500 ft agl, and the airplane was spinning when it impacted the ground. Although beyond the end of the takeoff runway was flat, unpopulated hard-dirt surface, suitable for a straight-ahead emergency landing, it is unknown why they pilot chose to return to the airport rather than lower the nose and land there.Twenty-six percent of Lancair airplanes have been involved in accidents, and 19 percent have been involved in fatal accidents. In 2008 and 2012, the FAA convened two safety groups specifically to address the airplane's \"unusually high accident and fatality rate compared to other amateur-built aircraft.\" The study noted that based on the statistics, the kit was involved in fatal accidents at \"a rate that is disproportionate to their fleet size.\" As a result of studies developed by these safety groups, the FAA acknowledged that accidents would continue to occur if no action was taken. Thus, the FAA issued a notice that Lancair pilots should \"review and thoroughly understand all information regarding stall characteristics and obtain specialized training regarding slow flight handling characteristics, stall recognition, and stall recovery techniques;\" install an angle-of-attack indicator to better predict a stall; and have their airplane evaluated by an experienced type-specific mechanic to ensure proper rigging, wing alignment, and weight and balance. The notice was recalled shortly after its release and another notice was released later to include other high-performance experimental amateur-built aircraft.When asked about what he disliked about the flight characteristics of the airplane, the pilot had told a technician who refueled the airplane that it was \"squirrelly.\" According to the FAA, depending on the complexity of the systems installed, pilots likely will require orientation and specially-tailored training to operate this airplane safely. Although the pilot was properly certificated in accordance with existing Federal Aviation Regulations and his estimated flight experience in the airplane was 13 hours 40 minutes, no evidence was found indicating that the pilot had received flight instruction in the accident airplane model, even though he was aware that insurance companies required him to do so in order to receive coverage.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss or commanded reduction of engine power during the initial climb for reasons that could not be determined because of postaccident impact damage and fire destruction to engine systems and components. Also causal were the pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and airplane control while attempting to return to the runway despite unpopulated, flat terrain immediately ahead that was suitable for an emergency landing; his decision to take off again with a known problem; and his lack of training in the make and model airplane."

He said he performed an engine run-up, taxied to the active runway, and maneuvered the airplane into takeoff position.  Shortly after he initiated the takeoff roll, the airplane began to pull to the left.  He indicated he applied right rudder, but could not prevent the airplane from continuing to the left.  At an airspeed of about 35 to 40 mph, he applied right aileron, and lifted the left main wheel off the ground.  The airplane began to track to the right, but when he lowered the left wheel to the ground, the airplane veered sharply to the left and departed the left side of the runway.  The airplane collided with a ditch and received damage to the propeller, the left main landing gear strut, and structural damage to the left wing.  Following the accident, the student pilot/owner said that a mechanic briefly examined the left wheel and left brake.  The mechanic did not discover a mechanical malfunction at that time.  A METAR at the time of the accident was reporting calm wind conditions.",

The pilot configured the airplane by placing the mixture control to the FULL RICH position, entered the spiral maneuver, and cleared the engine every 180 degrees while in the turn. After the fourth spiral, the pilot attempted to make a simulated emergency landing, but when he observed that he was high, he put the airplane into a slip to lose altitude. When the examiner instructed the pilot to go around, the pilot advanced the throttle, but the engine did not respond. The pilot subsequently landed the airplane long, and it ran off the end of the runway. During the postaccident examination, the engine was run with no anomalies noted. The inspector subsequently discussed with the flight school\u2019s chief flight instructor the procedure for setting the mixture control to the FULL RICH position at altitude before initiating a maneuver such as steep spirals. The chief instructor alluded to information provided by the engine manufacturer that the recommended procedure is to set the mixture to FULL RICH below 5,000 feet. After the accident, the chief instructor issued a company policy statement which read, \u201cWhen leaned at altitude for flight, students and instructors should gradually enrichen the mixture throughout the descent, reaching full rich mixture while descending through 4,000 feet.\u201d According to Service Instruction No. 1094D, issued by the engine manufacturer on March 25, 1994, relative to fuel mixture leaning procedures for all of the manufacturer's Opposed Series Engines, \u201cFor 5,000 feet density altitude and above or high ambient temperatures, roughness or reduction of power may occur at full rich mixture.\u201d A representative for the engine manufacturer stated that the mixture setting during a low-power descent is not really a concern and that the mixture only needs to be adjusted when the engine power is required during takeoff, climb, and cruise. The engine representative added that if the pilot had put the mixture to full rich and descended, the engine would have been fine and should not quit. Therefore, while it may have been possible that the placement of the mixture to the FULL RICH position at altitude could have resulted in the power interruption at the lower altitude, there is no definitive evidence to support this position.

During takeoff, the towrope between the tow plane and glider broke while the glider was about 300 feet above ground level.  The glider pilot reversed course and attempted to return to the departure runway.  The tow plane pilot said that when he looked back the glider was in a left turn with its heading passing through 030 degrees when the right wing suddenly dropped downwards and the glider appeared to descend vertically, nose down.  The glider made about 1/2 a clockwise rotation, nose down, before it impacted the desert.  The Safety Board Materials Laboratory examination of the towrope and safety link revealed:  1)  The towrope was worn by abrasion and sunlight at the glider connection end, which had substantially reduced the strength of the rope at the failure location; 2)  the worn end of the rope was about 60 percent weaker than the unworn end; 3)  the towrope failed due to overloading at the knot; and 4)  the unworn end of the towrope and the safety link met the tensile strength required by 14 CFR 91.309.  The rope area around the knot connecting the towrope to the safety link was wrapped in a protective layer of duct tape, and therefore, the rope condition at the failure point could not be easily examined by the pilot during a towrope preflight inspection.  Examination of the glider revealed no evidence of preimpact malfunction or failure of the flight control system.  The tow plane pilot reported that there were gusty winds and turbulence present at the time. The ASW-20 Flight Manual includes a section titled \"Dangerous Flight Attitudes,\" which contain a number of cautionary statements and warnings pertaining to stalled flight.  Full control deflections will result in wing dropping, whereas full-deflected controls in opposite directions with stick pulled completely back will case rapid wing dropping.  Initiated from turning flight the wing dropping is more rapid than from level flight.  Full deflections of opposite rudder and aileron deflections will lead to a spin.

The private pilot did not have a tailwheel sign-off or a current biennial flight review.  Arrangements were made through the aircraft manufacturer for an airline transport/ certified flight instructor (ATP/CFI) pilot who was a test and demonstration pilot for the company to fly the airplane back to Ohio with the new owner.  Prior to takeoff, there was an aircraft accident on the airport involving another airplane and the airport was temporarily closed.

The ATP/CFI stated that approximately four minutes later, the engine lost power.  The private pilot landed the airplane on the water.  Both pilots exited the airplane unharmed, however, the private pilot who did not know how to swim subsequently drowned.  The ATP/CFI was picked up by a Coast Guard Auxiliary boat approximately 40 minutes after the accident.

            "probable_cause": "The failure of both pilots to assure that the fuel cap was securely in place prior to takeoff which resulted in fuel siphoning and untimately fuel exhaustion.  An additional cause was the decision to fly over the lake outside of gliding distance to shore along with the delay in diverting to refuel the airplane."

Two witnesses reported hearing the airplane, which made them notice it flying toward them. They stated that it sounded like it \"sputtered\" and that they then saw the airplane nose dive into a spin. They indicated that the airplane appeared to flatten out before it collided with terrain.Review of radar data revealed that the airplane conducted various maneuvers before the accident, including a 360-degree left turn about 5 to 6 miles from the airport. The track then turned east before turning north away from the airport. The radar data indicated that the airplane slowed as it turned north. Only one of the radar plots indicated the airplane's altitude, and it indicated that it was at 3,600 feet (about 2,000 feet above ground level [agl]). A mechanic reported that he had performed an annual inspection on the airplane before the airplane's departure; however, the inspection was not noted in the airplane's maintenance records. The last recorded annual inspection was conducted about 17 months before the accident. Further, the postaccident examination revealed that the engines were missing their respective dataplates and that the altimeter and static system test was last conducted 25 months before the accident. Despite these discrepancies, examination of the airplane and engines did not reveal any abnormalities that would have prevented normal operation. On the basis of the evidence, the airplane slowed and then entered a  stall/spin. However, it could not be determined whether the pilot was performing an intentional maneuver or if there was a loss of engine power. According to the airplane's Pilot's Operating Handbook, stalls should be recovered no lower than 3,000 feet agl.A review of the pilot's logbooks revealed that he had last flown a multiengine airplane about 7 months before the accident and that he had flown only about 30 hours in multiengine airplanes in the 2 years before the accident. The pilot's last flight review, which was conducted in the accident airplane, occurred about 27 months before the accident. The pilot's toxicological report noted the presence of a therapeutic level of amitriptyline, an antidepressant, which was not declared in his medical history. It could not be determined whether the pilot was impaired by the amitriptyline or the underlying condition for which it was prescribed at the time of the accident.",

When the three helicopters neared the destination airport, the pilot of the UH-1 contacted the tower about 6 to 7 miles out and received landing instructions for the group.  About 1 mile south of the field on a downwind for runway 09-27, the tower instructed all three helicopters to turn left [north] for an approach to the grass infield south of runway 09-27 then to cross and land in the area north of runway 09-27 and adjacent to the aircraft parking area.  Each aircraft turned to a northerly heading for the approach.  The pilots reported that they maintained approximately 150-250 feet separation from the aircraft in front.  The UH-1 followed by the AH-1 landed uneventfully ahead of the OH-6A.  The pilot of the OH-6A slowed the helicopter to 30 knots and reduced the pitch.  He stated that when he '...increased the collective to maintain a normal approach profile...the increased collective had no apparent effect.  He increased the collective again to arrest the increasing rate of decent.  Again, the increased collective had no effect.'  As he passed through about 50 feet agl, he noted that the Engine/Rotor RPM had 'dropped below 100 percent.'  He announced, 'I have a loss of power,' and rotated the throttle to flight idle and initiated collective pitch pulled at 5 feet prior to touchdown.  The pilot/passenger in the left seat stated, '...as we approached for landing, the AH-1 abruptly slowed.  We closed within 75-100 feet behind...the AH-1, and [the pilot] raised the aircraft nose to maintain separation...and off set to its' right [east] 75 to 100 feet...[the pilot] called out that the aircraft was settling and he had no power response.  He increased collective pitch but the aircraft did not respond and settled vertically...I noticed no warning lights but, as the aircraft hit the ground, I saw the transmission oil pressure light come on.  No other warning light came on.'  The helicopter slid about 50 feet before it came to a rest upright, and the pilot announced over the intercom that 'he could not shut the engine down' so the pilot/passenger pulled the fuel shut off valve, turned off the switches, and turned the battery off.  According to the FAA inspector's statement, '...based on the relatively low time and experience of the pilot and crew member who were in control of this aircraft at the time of the accident...the accident occurred as the result of the pilot's loss of control of the aircraft when he inadvertently flew it into the wake turbulence of the two larger helicopters which landed in front of him...the pilot was unable to maneuver the aircraft out of trouble and consequently, the aircraft settled under power to a very hard landing.'  The engine was test run and no discrepancies were found.  No discrepancies were found with the airframe or controls.  The reported wind conditions at the airport at 1053 were from 270 degrees at 7 knots.  This wind condition had set up a crosswind condition from west to east, or from the landing helicopter's left to right.  The pilot's flight times on the NTSB 6120.1/2, showed he had a total flight time in all aircraft of 5,100 plus hours, 3,253 hour in helicopters, and a total of 13.9 hour in this make and model helicopter.

The flight continued in the traffic pattern for runway 36, and when on short final approach to the runway at 5 feet above ground level, the helicopter was at 25 knots indicated airspeed.  The helicopter contacted the runway with the skids parallel to the runway centerline, and the CFI allowed the helicopter to continue sliding.  The CFI advised the student that the lesson would conclude with a \"running takeoff\", and upon lifting off the runway at an indicated airspeed of 35 knots, he noticed a vibration from the main rotor system.  He noticed the rpm was decreasing and touched down again on the runway, at which time the helicopter began to \"shake violently.\"  He realized the flight had encountered ground resonance, and noticed that there was insufficient main rotor rpm to lift off the ground to stabilize the vibrating rotor blade system.  He lowered the collective but felt a force when he attempted to reduce throttle input; he felt the force was the student pilot applying throttle input.  At that point he was contacted in the head, lost consciousness, which he regained in the hospital.  The student pilot advised a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that when the flight was approximately 30 feet above ground level prior to performing a running landing, the CFI took the controls from him.  The flight continued and while sliding on the runway, the CFI started screaming and froze on the controls.  He (student pilot) then braced for impact.  Following recovery of the helicopter, the landing gear and main rotor dampers were removed for further examination at the manufacturer's facility with FAA oversight.  Examination of the main rotor blade dampers revealed all three exhibited damage associated from lead lag motions encountered in ground resonance.  Examination of the four landing gear dampers which had been installed when the helicopter was manufactured revealed all tested out of limits for charge pressure (low).  The helicopter was last inspected in accordance with a 100-Hour inspection on August 11, 2003; the helicopter had accumulated 87.9 hours since the inspection at the time of the accident.  Review of the 100-Hour inspection guide revealed the landing gear dampers are required to be inspected for operation and condition, and for damper extension with a full fuel tank.  Review of Section 12 of the Basic Handbook of Maintenance Instructions manual indicates the landing gear dampers will experience a decrease in pressure with subsequent use of the helicopter, and they should be extension checked during a 100-Hour inspection, or every six months, whichever occurs first.  According to a memorandum from the Director of Flight Training to all flight instructors dated August 25, 2003, with respect to the Dominican Republic Flight Training Program, running landings were prohibited to be demonstrated and practiced until a new order was given.",
            "probable_cause": "the inadequate 100-hour inspection of the helicopter by other maintenance personnel who failed to discover that the landing gear dampers had low pressure, which resulted in ground resonance and subsequent substantial damage during a run-on landing."

During the ensuing conversation, the pilot advised the controller that he was underneath the weather and that he had weather radar. The pilot then entered the weather in the vicinity of his destination airport. Radar imagery, witness statements, and measurements from local surface stations indicated that areas of light, moderate, and possibly heavy precipitation existed and that the airplane was most likely in instrument meteorological conditions in its final 2 minutes of flight. Review of radar data revealed that, after entering the weather, the pilot's altitude control became erratic, and the airplane entered an ever-tightening right turn, consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation. The airplane completed about two and a half 360-degree turns of progressively smaller diameter before radar contact was lost, and the airplane impacted terrain. No record of the pilot obtaining a weather briefing or filing a flight plan was discovered.Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact malfunction or failure of the airplane or engine, and it did not reveal any evidence that on-board weather radar was installed. During the wreckage examination, the remains of a portable global positioning system receiver were discovered. The receiver was not certificated for use under instrument flight rules and was intended by the manufacturer to be used as an aid for VFR navigation. It was capable of displaying weather data and images from the NEXt-generation RADar (NEXRAD) ground radar network, but, unlike on-board weather radar, transmitted NEXRAD data is not real-time. The receiver manufacturer cautioned that the lapsed time between collection, processing, and dissemination of NEXRAD images can be significant, and, therefore, they should only be used for long-range planning purposes and not for short-range weather avoidance.Furthermore, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NEXRAD data or any radar data should not be used to penetrate hazardous weather. Rather, it should be used in an early-warning capacity of pre-departure and en route evaluation. As discussed in the Safety Alert issued by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on in-cockpit NEXRAD, because NEXRAD images present radar data from multiple ground sites as a single mosaic image, the age indicated on the NEXRAD image does not show the age of the actual weather conditions but rather represents the time when the mosaic image was created. The actual weather conditions could be up to 15 to 20 minutes older than the age indicated on the image. Both the FAA and the NTSB advise that advanced avionics weather data systems should not be used as a substitute for a pre-flight weather briefing.",

The pilot/owner, was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.  The sport pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage. The local personal flight was originating at the time of the accident with a planned destination of Gnoss Field Airport, Novato, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed.The pilot stated that he landed at the airport earlier in the day. He refueled the airplane with full fuel and attempted a departure down runway 30. The engine began to operate roughly and he aborted the takeoff. After another attempt with the same results, he again aborted the landing and taxied the airplane to a mechanic on the field. The mechanic opined that he was experiencing vapor lock in the fuel system and suggested that he let the engine cool down. The pilot waited and then attempted the departure again. He performed a run-up of the engine, which appeared to be operating normally and aligned on runway 30. The airplane became airborne and as he began to climb through 50 to 75 feet, the engine experienced a partial loss of power. He pitched the airplane down into a nose-low configuration and after passing over a freeway (located at the end of the runway), he collided into a field.The engine will be retained for further examination.",

Won Pat Guam International Airport.  According to flight data recorder information and the captain's statement, the captain set the autopilot to fly a 3.4 degree descent angle as the aircraft descended through 3,600 feet.  At that point, the aircraft was 12.7 miles from the runway 6L touchdown point, where the calculated glideslope height based on the 3.0 degree glideslope specified on the ILS 6L approach chart is 4,060 feet.  Therefore, the aircraft began its approach from a position 460 feet below the glideslope at an angle that was 0.4 degrees steeper than the standard glideslope.  This resulted in a descent path that ended at the top of Nimitz Hill, approximately 4.5 miles from the runway 6L touchdown point.  The airplane struck power lines at the hilltop, which is located about one mile from the site of a fatal accident involving a Korean Airlines (KAL) Boeing 747 that occurred in 1997.  The crew then responded to a ground proximity warning system(GPWS) alert and began a climb, returning for another approach.  The Guam air traffic control radar system generated a minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alert to the radar controller at 17:34:25 that continued for 1 minute and 22 seconds and ended at 17:35:47.  During this period, the aircraft descended from approximately 1,700 feet to approximately 700 feet, and then began climbing in response to the GPWS alert.  The controller took no action to warn the crew or the GUM tower controller about the aircraft's MSAW alert status or proximity to terrain.  After the 1997 KAL accident, the Safety Board recommended that the FAA consider designating Guam International Airport as a special airport requiring special pilot qualifications.  At this time, that recommendation is classified as \"Open - Acceptable Action\" by the Safety Board.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's initiation of a premature descent that was both below the nominal glideslope and steeper than normal.  Contributing to the incident was the air traffic controller's failure to respond to the MSAW warning and issue a safety alert as required by FAA order."

The pilot reported a hydraulic system failure and diverted to the nearest airport.  During the emergency landing, after slowing the helicopter and descending through 100 feet, the helicopter yawed to the left.  The pilot attempted to apply right pedal but was met with more force than he was expecting to overcome in moving the anti torque pedals.  The pilot attempted to keep the helicopter in a level attitude; however, he was unable to stop the helicopter from spinning.  The helicopter touched down, and rotated on the ground until the right landing gear skid collapsed and the main rotor system impacted the ground.  The helicopter came to rest on its right side.  The engine continued to operate and the main rotor blades repeatedly impacted the ground until the fire department was able to shutdown the engine by directing a stream of firefighting foam into the engine intake.  The pilot turned off the electrical master switch and exited the helicopter.  The AS350 B3 is equipped with four servo actuators, three for the main rotor system and one for the tail rotor blade pitch control.  The flight manual emergency procedures section notes that without any hydraulic pressure, the anti torque pedal operating force is very high on the helicopter.  Post accident examination of the wreckage revealed the hydraulic test switch was depressed.  Activation of the hydraulic test switch will dump hydraulic pressure and is used during the preflight inspection to test the hydraulic accumulator pressure.  If it is depressed during flight, the hydraulic system will dump pressure and mirror a hydraulic system failure.  No other anomalies were noted with the hydraulic system during post accident examinations and testing.  The recommended emergency procedures for a hydraulic system failure dictates that the pilot make a flat approach over a clear landing area and land with slight forward speed.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.According to the pilot, the preflight, engine run-up, taxi, and takeoff from runway 9 were all normal. At 500 feet above ground level (agl) the engine lost power and the pilot maneuvered the airplane for a downwind landing on runway 27. The pilot confirmed the positions of the throttle, propeller, fuel pump, and fuel selector controls and the engine regained power temporarily. About 300 feet agl, the engine again lost power and the pilot elected to land in an off-airport field with the gear up due to the extension time required for the airplane\u2019s landing gear system. During a postaccident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, operation of the airframe boost pumps revealed that the pumps would not draw fuel. Closer examination of the fuel selector valve and fuel shut-off cock revealed staining consistent with fuel leakage. When positive pressure was applied to the fuel tanks, fuel leaked around the shaft of the fuel shut-off cock located under the cockpit instrument panel area. Pressure was removed from the tanks, the fuel shut-off cock was sealed with a rag, and the boost pumps were then able to draw fuel when power was applied. Removal of the rag created an air leak, and the boost pumps would not draw fuel. The fuel selector valve and the fuel shut-off cock were then removed, disassembled, and examined under the supervision of the FAA inspector. Examination revealed that the interior O-ring seals for the selector shafts were loose on both. Another owner of the same make and model airplane provided a written account of a nearly identical scenario, which was resolved with the replacement of the O-ring seals. The manufacturer's Special Inspection List outlined \"overhaul/replacement\" of the fuel shut-off cock every 5 years or 1,500 flight hours, whichever occurred first. At the time of the accident, the airplane had accrued 1,592 total aircraft hours. Seven months, and 8 aircraft hours had elapsed since the airplane's most recent annual inspection. According to the FAA inspector, 14 CFR Part 43, Appendix D, listed the minimum inspection requirements for the completion of an annual inspection, that manufacturer's recommended overhaul schedules were recommended and not mandatory, and that the overall responsibility for the airworthiness of the airplane fell to the owner/operator.",
            "probable_cause": "A total loss of engine power due to a fuel system air leak as a result of a deteriorated O-ring seal in the fuel shut-off cock. Contributing to the accident was the exceedance of the suggested overhaul schedule for the fuel shut-off cock."
