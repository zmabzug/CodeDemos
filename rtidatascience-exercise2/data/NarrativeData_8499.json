He was attempting to land with a left crosswind and/or quartering tailwind from a direction and at a speed conducive to a tail rotor vortex ring state condition.  The condition results in tail rotor thrust variations, which can require rapid and continuous pedal movements to maintain heading and cause unanticipated right yaw rates to develop.  If the yaw rate is not controlled immediately, the helicopter can rotate into a wind azimuth region where weather cock instability will accelerate the right yaw.  This condition will be aggravated at airspeeds below 30 knots when the loss of translational lift results in an increased power demand (more torque) and a corresponding increase in antitorque requirement.

With positive control of the helicopter, he safely landed at a nearby heliport. After touchdown, while shutting down and applying the rotor brake, he noted that the vibration increased dramatically as the rotor speed decreased to a stop. Upon a cursory inspection of the helicopter after shutdown, the pilot noticed that one pitch change link of one tail rotor blade was separated from its respective attach point at the blade, and the blade was out of its normally installed position. Further inspection revealed a hole in the right side of the tailboom and the tailcone was damaged consistent with the tail rotor blade contacting the tailboom.

Reported and forecast marginal visual flight rules (MVFR) conditions, and areas of instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), prevailed along their intended route of flight. This information would have been given to the CFI and/or student pilot if they would have requested a formal preflight weather briefing. Recorded radar data from the accident flight indicate that the airplane generally flew at an altitude that varied between 2,000 and 3,000 feet msl, which was consistent with an altitude that was intended to remain just below the reported scattered to broken layers of clouds along the route of flight.  The flight path was along a nearly straight line to the destination airport.  Due to radar coverage limitations, the radar data ended about 40 miles southeast of the accident site, when the airplane was flying about 2,200 feet msl, which was about 1,000 above the accident site elevation.A witness who lived in the vicinity of the crash site stated he heard the airplane fly over his home, with the engine sounding as if was operating at high power, followed by an impact sound. Examination of the crash site revealed that the airplane collided with trees and terrain in a steep nose-down attitude, and at a high velocity.  The engine and forward portion of the airplane were embedded about four feet into the ground. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airframe, engine, or systems. Analysis of the wreckage and surrounding terrain revealed impact damage signatures consistent with a loss of aircraft control while under engine power.  The direction of the impact was nearly opposite the intended route of flight.  The flaps and landing gear were retracted, consistent with a cruise flight configuration.  The accident site was located in remote, hilly terrain with very few lights.  The accident occurred in dark night conditions, and in reduced visibility from a low cloud ceiling and possible localized fog. The airplane likely entered instrument meteorological conditions, or conditions in which a horizon was not visible, which led to a failure of the CFI and/or student pilot to maintain level flight.  It is possible that the loss of control was precipitated by spatial disorientation; however, due to a lack of recorded radar data or flight recorder data at the time of the accident, the investigation could not determine whether the pilots became spatially disoriented.  Additionally, the investigation could not determine who was manipulating the controls at the time of the loss of control; however, the CFI was the pilot-in-command of the airplane.Review of the CFI and student pilot's chronological sleep patterns and duty day revealed that both pilots were susceptible to the effects of fatigue based on their sleep lengths during the 24 hours prior to the accident, and based on their time awake before the accident. Research has shown that human fatigue can degrade performance and judgment, and this likely impaired the performance and judgment of the CFI and student.[ This report was modified on January 26, 2010 ]",

Just before taking off on the accident flight, the pilot complained to a fellow company pilot that he felt ill, expressing fear of repercussions from his company if he grounded himself.  A few minutes before disappearing from contact with air traffic control, he radioed the fellow pilot (who was in another company aircraft on the same route): 'I don't feel so good...I feel like I'm going to toss my cookies.'  The aircraft wreckage was located about 11 hours after the disappearance, with the pilot fatally injured inside.  Wreckage distribution at the accident site was indicative of inflight separation of the right wing and horizontal stabilator. Subsequent examination indicated that the wing and stabilator separations were a result of overstress.  No evidence of mechanical problems was noted, other than the separated wing and stabilator.

Upon arriving in the fire traffic area, Tanker 11 followed the lead airplane into the drop zone, which was located in a shallow valley 0.4 mile wide and 350 feet deep. The lead airplane flew a shallow right turn onto final and then dropped to an altitude of 150 feet above the valley floor while approaching the intended drop zone. While making the right turn onto final behind the lead airplane, Tanker 11's right wing tip collided with terrain, which resulted in a rapid right yaw and subsequent impact with terrain. The wreckage created a 1,088-foot-long debris field, and a postimpact fire ensued. Two witnesses took photographs of the accident sequence photos, and an examination of these photographs showed that the lead airplane was positioned ahead of the tanker throughout the flight; however, the orientation of the lead airplane compared to the orientation of Tanker 11 indicated that Tanker 11 did not directly follow the lead airplane's path to the final drop course. Rather, it was about 700 feet left of the lead airplane\u2019s path and made a wider right turn as it attempted to align with the final drop course. The accident flight crewmembers had previously flown nearly the same exact drop and the lead pilot cautioned them about tailwind conditions during the flight; however, the wider turn suggests that they did not properly compensate for the wind conditions while maneuvering. In addition, the previous flight was conducted at an altitude above the ridgeline. GPS evidence indicates that the accident flight was conducted below the ridgeline, which would have made it more difficult to detect the rising terrain during the wider turn.

The private pilot and the pilot-rated passenger were not injured; however, a father and his daughter in shallow water near the shoreline were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the personal flight between Buchan Airport (X36), Englewood, Florida, and Venice Municipal Airport (VNC), Venice, Florida, conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.In an interview with the responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the pilot indicated that it was the first time the airplane had flown in the preceding 3 \u00bd months. The left fuel tank was \u00be full and the right fuel tank was \u00bd full. The engine started \"right away;\" however, when the pilot performed a magneto check, one of the magnetos had a 300-rpm drop. A second magneto check had the left magneto running roughly, but during a third magneto check, both magnetos were smooth and within limits. The carburetor heat check resulted in a smaller than usual drop of engine rpm.The takeoff was \"normal\" and the airplane climbed to about 1,000 feet, then turned south toward Englewood. It subsequently turned north toward Venice, still at 1,000 feet, with the pilot listening on the local airport traffic frequency to enter the landing pattern. Approaching Venice, the engine began to run roughly, and the pilot checked different positions of the ignition switch and changed fuel tanks, but the engine lost power and propeller began windmilling. Total flight time was 10 to 15 minutes. The pilot declared an emergency on the radio and began the forced landing descent. The airplane was over the water at the time, and the pilot was concerned that if he landed in deep water, the fixed landing gear airplane would flip over. The pilot saw groups of people along the beach, and attempted navigated around them. He then aimed for a spot where he thought there were no people, and landed in the water near the shoreline.After the pilot and passenger got out of the airplane, a lady shouted to them that she needed a cell phone. The pilot thought she wanted to call on their behalf, and it was only then that he learned that the airplane had hit the father and his daughter. According to an employee at VNC, about 1445, the pilot made an announcement on the common airport frequency, \"to the effect of \u2013 emergency can't make the airport.\" After two requests, the pilot provided the registration number, but when asked about location, he did not respond. The witness called 911 and asked the pilot of another airplane departing the airport to provide the location, which he responded was on the beach about 1 mile south of VNC. Venice Police provided transcripts from interviews with six witnesses. Witnesses were generally consistent as to what they saw and heard. One witness stated that he was standing in waist deep water about 10 to 15 feet from the shore and about 50 yards south of the family. He saw the airplane descend and it passed directly over his head about 30 feet above him. There was no noise from the engine and the propeller was \"kinda moving.\" He watched the airplane descend toward a group of people. It cleared half of the group, but apparently did not clear all of them. The witness further stated that he thought the airplane was \"drifting in because I was far enough out in the water that if he had continued on a straight course he probably would have just hit the water.\"Several other witnesses also noted that the engine was not running and that the propeller was turning; some noted the sound of a \"thump\" in conjunction with the landing. One witness stated that when the airplane hit the water, it \"kind of kicked over to the right,\" then went up onto the beach.According to the wife/mother of the victims, the family, consisting of herself, her husband, his son from a previous marriage, his mother, and their two daughters, arrived at the beach shortly before noon. About 1 hour later, another couple joined them. The family then moved farther up the beach to avoid new beach goers, leaving the husband's mother at the original location.At the time of the accident, the wife was near the shoreline, \"catty-corner\" to the water, with her husband and daughter about 10 to 15 feet directly behind her in about 2 \u00bd feet of water. The two had been standing, but bending to use strainers to collect shark teeth from the bottom. The wife first heard the airplane, then saw it out of her peripheral vision to the left, but had not seen it hit her family as it was out of her line of sight at the time. She then saw the airplane glide along the water and onto the sand. Her stepson, who was coming out of the water when the airplane passed by, told her that he had ducked when it went over his head, but did not indicate if he saw his father or his sister hit. The airplane came to rest less than 200 feet beyond the victims. The wife ran to pull her daughter out of the water, while one of her friends pulled her husband out. Her daughter had a pulse and was taking shallow breaths while her husband was unresponsive and not breathing. A man with knowledge of CPR subsequently provided assistance to her husband while the wife administered aid to her daughter.    On-scene photographs showed the airplane upright, nose-down at the waterline, angled slightly towards the beach, with the magnetic compass indicating 350 degrees magnetic. The nose landing gear was separated from the airframe, while both fixed main landing gear remained attached. The left wing, which was extended over the water, had about 4 feet of leading edge crushing on the outboard portion of the wing, and the wingtip undamaged. The two-bladed propeller exhibited no damage to one blade, while the other was bent aft about 60 degrees, beginning mid-span, consistent with a lack of power at touchdown. Photographs of the cockpit showed the fuel off, the magnetos off, the mixture rich, throttle forward and the carburetor heat off. The wing fuel tanks were subsequently defueled, the wings were removed, and the airplane was transported to a storage facility. There, NTSB, FAA, Piper Aircraft and Lycoming Engine investigators further documented the airplane and engine. Each wing fuel tank's fuel supply line from the tank to its disconnect point in the cockpit was checked via air flow to be clear, and each tank's vent system was also checked via air flow to be clear. Engine compression, magneto spark, fuel quality and engine crankshaft continuity checks were also accomplished with no anomalies noted. The fuselage with engine still attached was then strapped down to a trailer and original onboard fuel was supplied to the fuel selector valve via a portable external tank. The engine started on the second attempt; however, with the bent propeller, it could only safely be operated to about 900 rpm. The propeller was then removed and partially straightened to available capability, then reattached. The engine was subsequently restarted and was able to be run throughout throttle range up to 2,000 rpm safely. Magneto checks at that rpm yielded about a 100-rpm drop for both the left and the right magneto.After the engine run-ups, the carburetor was removed, disassembled and examined, with nothing found that would have precluded normal operation.Research of engine electrical, air induction and fuel delivery systems continues.",

The airplane continued its flight toward mountainous terrain. GPS data revealed that the airplane then conducted several 360-degree turns, which suggests that the pilot was attempting to maneuver around clouds or low visibility conditions. The airplane subsequently turned toward a nearby airport. The airplane\u2019s last recorded position revealed that it was about 900 feet above surrounding terrain in the area of the accident site. Weather conditions at the time included mountain obscuration and moderate turbulence for the area, which likely made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual separation and the altitude necessary to remain clear of the surrounding terrain; while maneuvering, he subsequently lost airplane control. Impact damage to the airplane was indicative of a left-wing-down, near-vertical, low-speed impact with trees and terrain. A propeller strike to a large tree indicated that the engine was producing power at the time of impact.\u000b\u000bThe wreckage was located 2 days after the accident, after search efforts were halted several times due to variable emergency locator transmitter position estimates and deteriorating weather conditions. First responders reported that the pilot was found beneath the airplane\u2019s wing with a sleeping bag under his torso. The pilot was dressed in multiple layers of clothes and survival gear. Food and water was found in the airplane but was not used. The pilot\u2019s cause of death was hypothermia due to the extreme winter conditions at the time of the accident; the pilot\u2019s injuries were not severe enough to be considered fatal.\u000b\u000bPostaccident examination of the airframe revealed that the pilot\u2019s shoulder harness failed during the accident. The stitched threading at the \u201cY\u201d junction joining the shoulder strap webbing behind the pilot\u2019s head to the webbing leading to the fuselage connection had separated. The pilot\u2019s injuries suggest that he was using the three-point shoulder harness at the time of the accident and was exposed to strong deceleration forces.

The pilot contacted lodge personnel while en route, and estimated his arrival time in about 3 minutes. When the airplane failed to arrive, an aerial search discovered the wreckage about 10 miles from the lodge, along the anticipated flight route. The NTSB's investigation revealed evidence that the airplane's lower left wing to fuselage attachment cap fitting had failed in flight, which resulted in the airplane's uncontrolled descent. The deformation at the upper forward and aft wing attachment points suggested that the airplane's left wing, in part, had failed in flight, but did not completely separate from the airplane. A subsequent metallurgical examination revealed that the fractured wing to fuselage attachment cap fitting displayed evidence of fatigue cracking, which emanated from areas of corrosion pitting. A Safety Board metallurgist noted that the corrosion pitting was located in the interior portion of the pin/bolt hole, where a large bore pin/bolt resides when the wing is attached to the fuselage, which is not visible when the bolt/pin is installed. The metallurgist also noted that there was corrosion on the forward and aft faces of the fitting that would have been visible. Other than the corrosion pitting on the attachment cap fittings and pins/bolts, no metallurgical anomalies were discovered. On September 9, 2008, the FAA issued a special airworthiness information bulletin (SAIB CE-08-47) recommending a visual inspection for evidence of corrosion, cracking, and other damage on the spar fittings, attachment bolts and related structure, to preclude a structural in-flight failure of the wings.

The aircraft departed the airport toward a VORTAC to the west, approximately 30 nautical miles (nm) away.  The first radar contact was at 1159, and the aircraft's Mode C transponder reported an altitude of 3,500 feet mean sea level (msl).  By the time the aircraft reached the VORTAC, the altitude had increased to 4,900 feet msl.  The aircraft continued to climb, passing through the VFR flight plan filed altitude of 8,500 feet msl, until it reached an altitude of 12,900 feet msl. The last 6 minutes of radar data reported the aircraft at various altitudes, starting at 11,000 feet msl and climbing to a maximum altitude of 12,700 feet msl.  During the last 3 minutes of flight, radar data showed the aircraft made numerous left and right climbing and descending turns, eventually reversing course.  The next to last radar return at 1221:24 indicated an altitude of 11,900 feet msl.  Nineteen seconds later, the last radar return reported an altitude of 7,700 feet msl.

He scanned an area at 400 feet above ground level (agl) for about 15 to 20 minutes. The airplane was configured with 20 degrees of flaps, carburetor heat on, and an engine power setting of about 18 to 20 inches of manifold pressure.  The outside temperature was 52 degrees F.  He spotted the cabin he was looking for, and began a descent for a low-level pass along a beach.  The pilot configured the airplane to full flaps, the engine power was near idle, and the carburetor heat was \"on.\"  He then attempted to add engine power to level the airplane, but it did not respond.  He pushed the throttle in and out several times without any change in power from idle.  The airplane continued to descend, and as the wheel began to strike low brush, the engine went to full power, but the airplane touched down in the rough terrain and nosed over.  The airplane received structural damage to the fuselage and wings.  In the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1) submitted by the pilot, he indicated that during the flight to the island, the engine developed a slight roughness, accompanied by about a 1 inch drop in manifold pressure.  He noted the carburetor temperature gauge was indicating -35 degrees F.  He applied carburetor heat, which raised the carburetor heat temperature to about 0 degrees F, but no further.  The pilot said he then decreased the engine power to idle, reapplied carburetor heat, and noted that after about 1 minute, the carburetor temperature increased to about 55 degrees F, which resolved the engine roughness.  The pilot reported that he previously had a carburetor heat problem about 8 months prior to the accident.  After a normal landing at an airport, he applied engine power to takeoff, but the engine would only produce about 14 inches of manifold pressure with the carburetor heat on.  After several seconds of idling the engine with full carburetor heat applied, full power was restored.

After refueling, he completed a local flight and returned to the departure airport, where he initiated an approach that terminated \"perfectly\" in a normal hover. However, the helicopter then \"started spinning to the right,\" and the spin could not be arrested with full application of left pedal. The pilot stated that he then increased collective pitch and the corresponding increase in engine power aggravated the spin. He then attempted a hovering autorotation, but the helicopter landed hard, rolled over on to its side, and was substantially damaged. A witness described the helicopter as it approached \"flying somewhat erratically\" about 40 feet above the runway. The helicopter was \"twisting\" to the left and right as it hovered \"shakily\" closer to the runway. The helicopter noise increased, the nose pitched up, the main rotors struck the ground, and the helicopter came to rest on its side. A detailed examination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. A Federal Aviation Administration advisory circular stated that loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) is a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic which could result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate which does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, could result in the loss of aircraft control. Further, any maneuver that required the pilot to operate in a high-power, low-airspeed environment with a left crosswind or tailwind would create an environment where unanticipated right yaw may occur.

On board were the instructor-rated pilot and the passenger-student. According to the pilot, while in cruise flight about 45 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft became \"extremely difficult\" to control, and the fabric wing skin was \"fluttering intensely\" along its trailing edge. The pilot opted for a precautionary landing on a nearby golf course. During the landing roll, the aircraft tipped onto one wing. Postlanding examination of the aircraft revealed that the fabric nose cone that was installed over the centerline juncture of the two wing leading edge tubes was damaged. The purpose of the nose cone was to prevent ram air from entering and inflating the wings during flight, which would change the wing profiles and result in controllability problems. The aircraft manufacturer indicated that the nose cone damage was primarily due to the nose cone being left in place when the wings were folded for transport or storage, a practice which was strongly discouraged by the manufacturer. In addition, although the manufacturer recommended against unprotected storage of the aircraft to preclude fabric deterioration from the elements, the pilot was known to store the aircraft outside on a regular basis. In combination, those practices by the pilot, which were contrary to the manufacturer's guidance, resulted in the degradation and eventual failure of the nose cone. With the aircraft on its wheels, the nose cone and upper surface of the wing were at least 8 feet above the ground, but there was no evidence that the operator or the accident pilot had or utilized a stepladder or other means to access and inspect the nose cone and wing upper surface before flight.

Weather conditions at the departure airport were VFR, the weather conditions en route were a combination of marginal VFR and instrument flight rules (IFR), and the weather at the destination airport was IFR. The pilot had obtained a weather briefing earlier in the evening, during which he was informed that VFR flight was not recommended. About 30 minutes before the accident, the pilot's in-flight weather briefing indicated that instrument meteorological conditions, including low ceilings and mountain obscuration, were forecast for their intended route and at their destination. About 4 minutes before the accident, the pilot advised air traffic control personnel that \"we are losing VFR, I need a deviation.\" Radio and radar contact were then lost. A postaccident examination of the wreckage indicated that the airplane struck the top of a tree, rolled inverted, and impacted the ground. No preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation were noted.

Analysis of the radar data and wreckage information revealed that the airplane made a series of erratic maneuvers, including a 360-degree heading change, before entering a descent and impacting the ground at high speed. These maneuvers took place in the last few minutes of the flight and were consistent with spatial disorientation. FAA guidance indicates that spatial disorientation can occur when there is no natural horizon or surface reference, such as a night flight in sparsely populated areas similar to that of the accident area and conditions. Although about 34 percent of the moon's disk was potentially illuminated at the time of the accident, given the cloud coverage in the area it is unlikely that the moon provided any illumination over the accident site.

The crew reported that the pilot performed a high recon of the landing area, noting the surface winds, approach and departure paths, and the conditions of the landing zone.  The approach was planned to terminate at a hover.  The grass at the landing zone is normally less than a foot long; however, due to the record rainfall this year, the grass was 3-to-4 feet tall.  Both pilots underestimated the effects of prolonged hovering over tall grass.  The tall-waving grass disoriented the pilot and allowed the helicopter to drift into the trees.

The pilot, a pilot-rated passenger, and another passenger sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was destroyed by the impact and subsequent fire. The airplane was registered to and operated by Orthopedic Aviation Services LLC under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Night instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions prevailed in the area of the accident. The flight operated on an activated IFR flight plan. The flight originated about 1545 from the Washington Municipal Airport (AWG), near Washington, Iowa, and was destined for the Findlay Airport (FDY), near Findlay, Ohio.Preliminary flight service station information showed that the pilot requested a weather briefing and filed an IFR flight plan for a direct flight from AWG to FDY.A fueling receipt from AWG showed that N811CD was serviced with 26.67 gallons of 100 low lead aviation gasoline at 1519. The AWG airport manager indicated that he was at the airport at 1530 and he talked to three people who flew in N811CD. There were two men about 60 and a woman of the same age. He reported that they said they were flying east and would be back on Sunday as part of their return flight. Witnesses reported to the airport manager that they thought the woman was seated in the front right seat. The manager indicated that from 300 feet away, the airplane looked very clean. He was outside when they took off and the engine start-up sounded normal as did the engine run-up. The manager said that the takeoff was under full power and they climbed at a normal rate of climb.According to preliminary information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the accident airplane communicated with the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) near Ft. Wayne, Indiana. About 1729, the pilot requested a climb to 10 or 11 thousand feet above mean seal level (MSL) because he was \"picking up a little ice\". The air traffic controller cleared him 10,000 feet MSL, and asked for more details. The pilot reported that windshield was picking up a little ice, and temperature was minus six degrees. About 1746, the pilot reported that the cloud tops were ragged between 9,500 and 10,300 feet MSL. About 1749, the pilot requested a lower altitude and the controller cleared him to 5,000 feet MSL. About 1751 pm the controller handed him off to Toledo TRACON.About 1751, the pilot checks on with Toledo TRACON and indicated that he was on descent. The controller asked the pilot if he had current FDY weather. About 1725, the pilot reported that he has the current FDY weather and requested the RNAV [Area Navigation] Runway 25 approach to FDY. The controller advised the pilot to expect that RNAV approach. The last radio transmission from the airplane was received about 1754. The last transponder reply was at 1757, which indicated the airplane was at 5,100 feet MSL. That transponder reply showed the airplane was located to the south and east of the intersection of Route 60 and Town Road 137.A witness was driving in her car eastbound on Route 60 and was approaching Town Road 117. This intersection was about three miles west of the accident site. She indicated that she was driving about 45 to 50 mph. It was dark at the time and \"spit\" rain was coming down. She said that she could see through the car's windshield. She stated that above woods just south of Route 60, she saw a light coming down slowly. She described it as a comet. The descent angle she physically gestured was about 35 to 45 degrees downward in the direction of the accident site. She said she saw the descending light for about two seconds. She subsequently saw an explosion, which was orange in color.Another witness was in a house about a third of a mile northwest of the accident site. She indicated that a heavy wind or tornado sound is what got her attention. She also heard a sound she vocally described as \"NEEEEER.\" She saw a reflection of light in a mirror. An explosion occurred when the NEEEEER sound stopped. She said that the conditions at that time were windy, dark, and rainy.The 59-year-old pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) private pilot certificate with an airplane single-engine land and instrument ratings. He had been issued a FAA third-class medical certificate on October 15, 2014, with a limitation that he must have available glasses for near vision. The pilot reported on the application for that medical certificate that he had accumulated 987 hours of total flight time and 150 hours of flight time in the six months prior to that application.The last entry in the pilot's logbook was dated November 5, 2014. The pilot recorded that he had accumulated 1,000.3 hours of total flight time, 151.5 hours of flight time during night conditions, 127.8 hours of flight time in SR22 airplanes, and 19.3 hours of flight time in actual instrument conditions. A certified flight instructor's endorsement in the pilot's logbook showed that the pilot received a flight review on August 16, 2014.N811CD, a 2001 model Cirrus Design Corporation SR22, serial number 0120, was a four-place single engine low-wing airplane powered by a six-cylinder, 310-horsepower, Teledyne Continental Motors model IO-550-N7B engine, with serial number 686224, that drove a three-bladed Hartzell constant speed propeller.At 1753, the recorded weather about 38 miles and 93 degrees from the accident site at FDY was: Wind 260 degrees at 10 knots; visibility 3 statute miles; present weather mist; sky condition overcast clouds at 600 feet; temperature 7 degrees C; dew point 6 degrees C; altimeter 29.81 inches of mercury.The main sections of the airplane fuselage and empennage were found impacted and buried in soft terrain about 199 degrees and 907 feet from the intersection of Route 60 and Town Road 137. The airplane's resting heading was about 77 degrees. The airplane's airframe was found fragmented with its heavier components north of the main wreckage and its lighter components east of the main wreckage. The observed debris field of components extended about 124 feet north and about 187 feet east of the main wreckage. The propeller and propeller flange separated from its engine crankshaft and was found buried about four feet below the field. The propeller blades exhibited S-shaped bending and leading edge gouges. The engine was found deformed and buried about eight feet below the field. The no. five and no. six cylinders separated from their crankcase. Disassembly of the fuel pump showed its shear shaft separated in overload and it shaft was bent. The pump's vanes were intact and the pump rotated by hand freely about a quarter turn. The pump's mixture arm also rotated when moved by hand. Both magnetos sustained impact damage. One magneto produced spark when its impulse coupling was rotated by hand. Removed sparkplugs exhibited normal combustion discoloring and a \"worn out, normal condition\" when compared to a Champion Check-A-Plug chart. Accessible cylinders were inspected using a lighted borescope and no preimpact anomalies were detected during the borescope inspection. Disassembly of the oil pump revealed no debris or preimpact anomalies. Disassembly of the fuel manifold revealed that its seal surface facing its screen and valve exhibited deterioration and its seal surface facing its spring did not exhibit deterioration. Disassembly of the attitude indicator revealed rotational scoring on its rotor and cage. The rocket motor and parachute were found within subsurface empennage and fuselage fragments in the main wreckage area. The rocket motor was found with its propellant expended and it exhibited discoloration consistent with thermal damage. The parachute was found in a packed state and it exhibited deformation and discoloration consistent with thermal damage. Flight control cable and engine cable continuity was not established due to fragmentation and thermal damage. Airframe components in the debris field exhibited localized discoloration and charring consistent with a post-impact ground fire. Both navigation light covers were found and green glass fragments were found under the navigation light cover on the south side of the main wreckage. The engine cowling was fragmented and it exhibited a crush line consistent with a right wing low impact. Both left and right ailerons and flaps were found resting on the ground in the debris field to the north of the main wreckage. The empennage to include the lower section of the rudder was found discolored and deformed consistent with thermal damage. The empennage was found under charred sections of the fuselage at the southwest side of the main wreckage. The upper section of the rudder was found resting on the ground in the debris to the north of the main wreckage. Separation surfaces on the upper and lower sections exhibited consistent sized and shaped tears and separations. The upper rudder section did not exhibit the same dark discoloration as the lower section did.The Paulding County Coroner was asked to perform an autopsy on the pilots and take toxicological samples for testing at the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute.The main wreckage exhibited charring, deformation, and discoloration consistent with a ground fire. Separated airframe components in the debris field exhibited localized discoloration and charring consistent with a post-impact ground fire.

The propeller blades departed the airplane and the engine subsequently experienced an overspeed, followed by a loss of power. During a forced landing, the airplane encountered a ditch and spun 90 degrees. Metallurgical examinations of the blades could not determine the method of failure. Tests and calculations indicate that the engine could not rotate fast enough to liberate the blades unless their strength had been degraded in some way. Several possible sources of such degradation were observed, but none of them could be conclusively identified as the cause of the event. The strength of the blades was provided by the wood of the propeller, and the fractures in the wood of the three blades appeared similar, making no obvious difference to identify the initial separation. The blades were found very close to one another, suggesting that they were liberated at nearly the same point of rotation during a single revolution of the propeller. Assuming one blade had accumulated enough damage to initiate the event, the resulting unbalanced vibration was sufficient to eject the other two blades, in the process creating fractures similar to those on the damaged blade. The measured gap between hub halves was less than the expected gap for new, correctly installed blades. Such over-clamping of the hub is one problem that has apparently occurred in the past due to improper torquing. It is possible that the hub had previously been over-clamped to a greater degree, with subsequent adjustment leading to an under-clamped condition. Looseness in this area can lead to fatigue cracking, because it allows for the variations in stresses from repetitive loads to be maximized on the components being connected. Bird impact was ruled out, but the blade might have been struck by debris picked up during takeoff. Although there was no staining or other signs of degradation in the wood, one blade had an area that was susceptible to moisture due to a manufacturing defect, which could have allowed the decrease in the stiffness and strength of wood structures and may have played a role in liberating the blades.",

The pilot established the airplane\u2019s best glide speed and declared an emergency with air traffic control, and an air traffic controller then provided vectors toward the nearest airport.

A material analysis of the fractured counterweight pin revealed failure signatures consistent with overload.

The SB described two instances of sudden engine stoppage as a result of a crankshaft counterweight release.

As a result, the manufacturer recommended that engine cruise rpm settings be no lower than 2,300 rpm. Although the engine operating manual cautioned that the minimum cruise rpm setting was 2,300 rpm, the airplane manufacturer did not include this information in the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook. A review of recorded data from the accident airplane revealed that nine flights were flown in the 6 months before the accident and that, during these flights, the accident airplane was operated at or below 2,300 rpm for 20 minutes or longer.

The pilot reported that the engine had just been overhauled and reinstalled on the airplane.  After a successful ground run, a flight test was conducted.  The pilot reported that he and an aircraft mechanic departed with the right fuel tank selected, climbed to 8,500 feet mean sea level, and circled the airport while checking the engine performance.  The pilot reported the new fuel pump was putting out nearly 15 psi., whereas, the previous fuel pump had put out 9 psi.  After an hour of flying, the pilot started his descent to land with the fuel selector still on the right fuel tank.  While on final approach he added power, but the engine did not respond.  He could not restore engine power before the airplane impacted the ground.  An inspection of the airplane revealed there were 6 gallons of fuel in the left fuel tank, and 2.5 gallons of fuel in the right fuel tank.  The wing fuel tanks each held 20 gallons of fuel with 17 gallons being useable fuel.  The inspection revealed no airframe or engine anomalies.  The pilot reported, \"I think what happened was that the increased fuel pump pressure transferred the fuel from the right tank into the left tank at an accelerated rate, and I had no idea that I was getting that close to empty.\"  The engine was removed from the airframe and an engine run was conducted.  The engine started and ran.  The pilot reported that he departed with 20 gallons of fuel in the right fuel tank, 5 gallons of fuel in the left fuel tank, and 10 gallons of fuel in the auxiliary tank.  The Beechcraft Bonanza C35 Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) states: \"Take-offs should be made using the left main tank and landings should be made using the main tank that is more nearly full.  In no case should a take-off be made if the fuel indications are in the yellow band or, with less than 10 gallons of fuel in each main tank.\"  The POH also states: \"The pressure type carburetor returns about 3 gallons per hour of excess fuel to the left main cell regardless of the cell selected.\"",
