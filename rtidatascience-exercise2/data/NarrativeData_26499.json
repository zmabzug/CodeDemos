A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right main landing gear air-oil shock absorber (oleo) was broken.  Further examination revealed that the end cap of the oleo was separated from the outer tube of the oleo.  The end cap was held in place by two bolts, 180 degrees apart, inserted radially through the outer tube.  The bolts were then threaded into the machined end cap.  The holes in the outer tube were elongated and torn out to the end of the tube.  Further examination revealed a second set of holes through the outer tube about 90 degrees to the first set of holes.  The second set of holes also revealed elongation of the holes.  According to the airplane owner, the right oleo was an original part.  The left strut had been replaced with a new strut since the airplane was manufactured in 1959.  According to the airplane type certificate holder, it is an approved repair procedure to rotate the outer tube of the oleo and drill a second set of holes when elongation of the first set is discovered.",

The airplane struck an unoccupied factory on the southeast corner of the airport. Damage signatures indicated that the right wing struck the building about 8 feet above the ground while the airplane was in an approximate 30-degree right bank. Ground scars and propeller damage indicated that the engine was running at the time of impact. The pilot had owned the airplane about 9 years, but his experience in the airplane could not be determined. The pilot's autopsy and toxicology results did not reveal any conditions that would have affected the pilot\u2019s operation of the motorglider. Examination of the flight control system and the engine did not reveal any preaccident mechanical conditions or failures that would have precluded normal operation or warranted an immediate turn back for landing. The propeller blade pitch and most cockpit controls were found in their normal or expected positions/settings. However, several conditions that could have contributed to or been indicative of operational difficulties were observed. The circuit breaker for the propeller pitch control was found in the \"out\" (circuit disabled) position; testing indicated that the breaker was functional, and complied with the manufacturer's specifications. It could not be determined when or how the breaker came to be set to that position. The airplane pitch trim control was found in the full airplane nose-up position instead of the neutral position, but the reasons for this could not be determined. Throughout its range, the tachometer indicated about 15 percent lower than the actual propeller rpm. The nest of a paper wasp, which was likely occupied by a few insects during the attempted flight, was found in the cockpit air inlet, and it is conceivable that the wasps were disturbed and entered the cockpit after takeoff. Since the canopy could not be opened in flight, the presence of the wasps could have prompted the pilot's turn back. Neither the actual climb rate nor the maximum altitude of the airplane could be determined. Therefore, it could not be determined whether the pilot's decision to return for landing was based on the airplane performance, one of the discrepancies noted above, or some combination thereof. Examination of the cockpit indicated that only the takeoff checklist was readily available to the pilot at the time of the accident and that the emergency and other procedures checklists remained inside the flight manual, which was stowed in an undetermined location for the flight. Although an emergency landing on the terrain south of the airport and more closely aligned with the departure heading probably would have damaged the airplane, it also would have likely resulted in a more successful outcome.",

The pilot tried to land on a road but was unable.  The pilot stated the 'aircraft [was] in ground effect with [the] stall warning horn in operation.'  He 'flew within 30 yards of road when [he] could no longer keep in ground effect with power that the engine was producing.'  The pilot made a forced landing on soft sandy soil south of the airport.

Motorists observed the wreckage near a road that was in the flat bottom of a canyon whose floor width varied from an estimated 50 yards at the narrowest point to 200 yards at the widest point.  The canyon made several left and right turns as it wound its way uphill in a general southeasterly direction.  The canyon sides appeared to be several hundred feet higher than the accident site elevation and the rim appeared to be about 100 feet higher at the head of the canyon.  An evaluation of the ground scars and impact signatures on the wreckage disclosed that the airplane was in a left turn attempting to reverse course out of the box canyon when the left wing tip dug into the ground.  The airplane then tumbled so that it was pointing down canyon when it came to rest.  No evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction was noted during the post accident inspection.",

The pilot rated passenger reported minor injuries and the pilot was uninjured.  A bank repossessed the airplane.  The bank was informed that the engine was reportedly making metal.  The bank's broker requested a ferry permit from the FAA for being out of annual only.   An aircraft purchase agreement was completed between the bank, the aircraft broker, and the pilot rated passenger for the buyer of record.  The agreement stated, 'Aircraft sold as-is, where is.'  The bank's representative said that no representations were made to the purchasers, that no reports of the airplane status were passed on to the purchasers, and that the ferry permit was faxed to his location.  A special flight permit limitation stated that '1. Carriage of persons other than essential crewmembers is prohibited.'  The accident pilot said that his medical certificate had been expired at the time of the accident.  The pilot rated passenger was an Airframe and Powerplant mechanic.  The passenger endorsed the airplane's logbook, 'I have inspected this aircraft [and] found it to be airworthy for a one time ferry flight in accordance with this ferry permit.'  The accident engine was examined and found to have a hole in its case near the number two cylinder.  Disassembly revealed silver colored and silver and copper colored debris in the oil sump pan.  The oil screen assembly was found secured by twisted safety wire.  That safety wire was coated with oil like substance and a dust like substance was found adhering those twists.  The screen and oil cooler contained debris. The crankshaft's cheek was found separated between the number two connecting rod and the number two main bearing. The cheek was discolored and deformed.  The number two main bearing was found with its left half not in place.  The aft crankshaft section was sent to the Materials Laboratory for detailed examination.  The lab report stated, 'Fracture features for the fatigue region emanated from multiple origins on the surface of the aft radius of the second main journal, with primary initiation approximately in the center of the origin area.  The boundary of the fatigue region was obliterated by mechanical damage.  The surface of the aft second main journal cheek radius was scored and burnished.

The increased drag on the blades acts like a huge rotor brake causing the rotor RPM to rapidly decrease, further increasing the rotor stall.

At an altitude estimated to be between 200 to 300 feet, witnesses heard a \"pop,\" saw parts come off the airplane, and then saw it nosedive into the water. An installed ballistic recovery parachute partially deployed just before water impact. No witnesses reported any bird activity in the area at the time of the accident. The airplane was recovered from the water, except for the propeller and propeller gearbox, which were never located. After a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) examination, and unknown to the pilot's wife, who thought it was in storage, the airplane was disposed of. The pilot's wife subsequently recovered the engine with the three-pronged engine-side gearbox coupling flange still attached, but after moving out of state disposed of that as well.Photographs provided by the FAA and sheriff's department indicated that once the gearbox and propeller separated from the engine, they severed the airplane's tail support structure, which resulted in a loss of pitch control. Additional photographs indicated that the propeller gearbox adapter that joined the gearbox to the engine was fractured and mostly missing and that three bolts, one of which would have normally been in each of the three prongs that connected the engine-side gearbox coupling flange to a rubber damper inside the adapter, were missing. Threadlocking material, which would have helped maintain torque, was not observed in the photographs. The pilot had purchased the airplane about 2 1/2 weeks before the accident as non-flyable parts. The former owner had previously removed the engine, had work performed on it by the engine distributor, and reinstalled it on the airplane prior to selling it to the accident pilot. No maintenance entries were recorded in the airplane logbook. According to the engine distributor, after repair the engine would have been shipped with the gearbox attached loosely, in an \"up\" position, to fit into the shipping box. Upon installation, the gearbox would have needed to be rotated 180 degrees to the \"hanging\" position to maintain the thrust line below the engine. After the sale of the airplane, the accident pilot was seen performing maintenance on the airplane, which was legal since it was experimental. However, the airplane had no annual condition inspection, which was required by its operating limitations, and could have only been performed by an FAA-certified mechanic or repairman. Sometime after the pilot had begun flying the airplane, the previous owner observed that the gearbox retaining bolts were loose, and advised the pilot that they had to be tightened. The previous owner subsequently saw the pilot tightening the bolts without using a torque wrench, and advised him that he needed to use one. The pilot then acquired a torque wrench, but the torque values he used could not be determined. The pilot was the last known person to work on the airplane, and several days before the accident had advised the kit manufacturer that he had cleaned and retorqued all the bolts. Whether he meant only the gearbox-to-adapter bolts or whether he included the flange bolts among those torqued is not known; there were no maintenance entries in the airplane's logbook. Because of the missing gearbox and propeller, and the disposal of the engine, it was not possible to definitively determine the sequence of events leading to the separation of the gearbox. However, if the gearbox adapter had failed first, there would likely still have been some remnants of the flange bolts remaining in the flange, and possibly bent flange prongs along with torn threads in the bolt holes. Because the majority of the bolt hole faces were pristine, it is likely that there was a loss of torque on the flange bolts and that they backed out of their holes. It is unknown if the loss of torque resulted from inadequate torque during bolt installation or whether a different part of the gearbox became loose first, which then overcame the proper torque. Because of a lack of record-keeping, the person who last torqued the bolts could not be determined.",

The accident pilot had diverted from his intended destination due to weather.  When he arrived at the accident airport, the local controller advised him that he was number 2 for landing behind a MD-11.  The local controller instructed him to do two 360-degree turns on downwind for spacing and to land beyond the touchdown point of the MD-11.  On final approach, the local controller asked the accident pilot if he had observed where the MD-11 had touched down, which was at the 1,000-foot marker.  The pilot indicated that he had, and would plan, his touchdown point beyond that.  After the MD-11 landed, it exited the runway at taxiway B-5 and was holding perpendicular to the runway awaiting ground control clearance, with the tail end of the airplane facing the runway.  Tower personnel indicated that the accident airplane touched down at taxiway B-3, about 2,000 feet down the runway, and beyond the MD-11's touchdown point.  The MD-11 had started to move very slowly off the taxiway prior to the accident airplane passing behind it.  On the landing rollout the tail of the accident airplane started to oscillate up and down after passing behind the tail end of the MD-11.  The oscillations continued to increase, and on the third oscillation it nosed over and came to rest inverted.  Tower personnel reported that the MD-11 was off the runway prior to the accident airplane being cleared to land, and there was no part of the airplane protruding over the runway during the landing rollout of the accident airplane.  The accident airplane touched down near taxiway B3, about the 2,000-foot marker, and continued a long rollout towards taxiway B5 where the MD-11 had exited.

About ten minutes after making a normal radio transmission, the helicopter was located by the pilot of a second company helicopter who was also conducting a tour.  The accident helicopter impacted a nearly level, snow-covered glacier, and all occupants received fatal injuries.  The leading edge of the impact crater was angled between 30 and 45 degrees below the horizon, and the face of the airspeed indicator gauge had a needle slap mark at 130 knots.  The pilots of the only two helicopters near the accident site at the time of the accident, said the \"flat light\" made the featureless, snow-covered terrain difficult to discern from the indefinite, overcast ceiling. Photographs taken within one hour of the accident showed that the mountain pass the pilot was attempting to fly through was difficult to distinguish from the clouds, the glacier surface, and the surrounding snow-covered terrain.  A postaccident inspection discovered no evidence of any preaccident mechanical anomalies.  At the time of the accident, the pilot had accrued 7.9 hours in AS-350 helicopters, and a total of 37.5 hours in turbine helicopters, all with the accident company.  This was the second day the pilot operated the AS-350 by himself.  The pilot did not hold any instrument certificates, nor was he required to by the FAA.  FAA Order 8400.10 requires Principal Operations Inspectors (POIs), and approved company check airmen, to have pilots demonstrate their ability to control a helicopter solely by reference to flight instruments during 14 CFR 135.293 competency checks for VFR-only helicopter operations.  This requirement is not specified in 14 CFR Part 135.  The FAA approved the company's training manual without this requirement being incorporated.  The FAA did not ensure that the company check airman was aware of the checking requirements listed in FAA Order 8400.10.  The pilot received no emergency instrument training from the company, nor did the company require him to demonstrate the ability to control the helicopter solely by reference to the installed flight instruments.  The helicopter was required to, and did have, a gyroscopic pitch and bank indicator installed. The FAA's training minimums for new hire pilots is 16 hours of Indoctrination Training, and 16 hours of aircraft ground training.  The FAA's national norm for these training programs are 24 hours each.  POIs can approve the minimum hours based on the type and sophistication of the training methods.  The approved training for the accident company was the minimum.  The pilot's previous helicopter piloting experience (as a student, and as a flight instructor) was in Arizona and California.  The pilot stated on his company resume that he had accrued 891 hours of helicopter flight experience at the time of his employment.  The NTSB IIC, and the FAA, estimated the pilot actually had 612 helicopter flight hours when hired.  The company had not received background checks for the pilot before the accident occurred, and was allowed by the  Pilot Records Improvement Act to use a pilot for 90 days prior to receipt of background information.  The pilot had expressed to a previous employer, and a previous instructor, that he was uncomfortable with company pressure to fly tours in bad weather. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's continued VFR flight into adverse weather, spatial disorientation, and failure to maintain aircraft control.  Factors associated with the accident were pressure by the company to continue flights in marginal weather, and the \"flat\" lighting leading to whiteout conditions.  Additional factors were the pilot's lack of instrument experience, lack of total experience, inadequate certification and approval of the operator by the FAA, and the FAA's inadequate surveillance of the emergency instrument procedures in use by the company.

Please see the docket for this accident to view the original report.***The helicopter impacted terrain during a sightseeing flight scheduled to fly from the island of Maui to the island of Molokai and return. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the departure airport; however, scattered rain showers and low clouds were forecast and reported along the helicopter's route of flight. When the accident occurred, the helicopter was flying over mountainous terrain and likely traversing down one of several ridges leading from Molokai's central peaks toward the lower terrain near the shoreline in marginal weather conditions. Several witnesses reported that the accident occurred between rain squalls, and one witness reported that it occurred during a heavy rain squall. All of the witnesses reported that heavy localized rain showers with strong gusting wind conditions existed around the time of the accident. Two witnesses reported that their attention was drawn to the helicopter when they heard a \"whoop whooping\" sound. One of these witnesses observed the helicopter descending from the ridgeline, and the other witness, who was closest to, and had the clearest view of, the accident helicopter, reported that the helicopter went \"straight down\" and impacted the ground.The debris field leading up to the main wreckage was about 1,330 feet long and consisted mostly of pieces from the fenestron, which is a shrouded tail rotor, indicating that the fenestron separated from the helicopter before the main wreckage impacted the ground. The remainder of the helicopter was accounted for at the main wreckage site except for the outboard portion of the right horizontal stabilizer, which was not identified in any of the recovered wreckage. A detailed examination of the wreckage indicated that the accident sequence of events likely began when the pilot failed to maintain sufficient terrain clearance, and the horizontal stabilizer and lower forward portion of the fenestron impacted vegetation and/or terrain. The upward and aft loading at the horizontal stabilizer, more pronounced on the right side, sheared the right attachment fittings, which allowed the right side of the stabilizer to travel aft. The combined loading from the horizontal stabilizer and the fenestron's impact with vegetation and/or terrain caused the stress in the forward flange of the junction frame to exceed its ultimate design strength. The forward flange of the junction frame fractured, which allowed the fenestron to separate from the tailboom. The torque input from the tail rotor drive shaft caused the separated fenestron to rotate counter-clockwise, which drove the lower portion of the fenestron into the main rotor disc, where it was impacted at least three times on the left side. After the fenestron separated from the tailboom, the helicopter lost yaw control, and its center of gravity shifted forward, which caused it to become uncontrollable and, subsequently, descend to the ground.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from mountainous terrain while operating in marginal weather conditions, which resulted in the impact of the horizontal stabilizer and lower forward portion of the fenestron with ground and/or vegetation and led to the separation of the fenestron and the pilot's subsequent inability to maintain control. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to operate into an area surrounded by rising terrain, low and possibly descending cloud bases, rain showers, and high wind."

Upon reaching altitude, he leveled off and retarded the throttle to cruise power and turned off the fuel pump. At that time, the engine began running rough like a \"magneto failure\". He immediately turned the fuel pump back on, made a left standard turn back toward the runway. The engine continued to lose power and he could get no response from the throttle. He tried to glide to the runway, but then realized he was going to be short. He elected to land in a road intersection. He saw two sets of power wires in his path and went over the first set and had to go under the second set. Unable to regain altitude, he impacted the ground thirty yards short of the road and slid through the intersection. Damage consisted of the left wing, left main landing gear, nose gear, engine mount, firewall, and tearing of the bottom right wing lower skin. Examination of the engine by the FAA found fuel in the gascolator and carburetor bowl with a small  amount of water in both. The throttle cable was attached and functioning. There were no obstructions observed in the intake manifold. The magnetos, spark plugs and compression were all within normal limits, and valve and valve train continuity was established through to the accessory section.

The CFI said the first two circuits around the traffic pattern were uneventful, and the student performed satisfactorily.  During the third touch-and-go landing the student indicated that the airplane turned right without his application of right rudder pressure.  The CFI responded by instructing her student in the proper usage of the rudder pedal.  The flight continued around the traffic pattern.  The student then performed a normal power on approach with 30 degrees of wing flaps extended for another touch-and-go landing.  The touchdown was not hard, and no vibrations or unusual noises were noted.  As the student increased the engine power to takeoff and was raising the wing flaps, the airplane again started an uncommanded right turn.  The student told the CFI to take control of the airplane and she immediately took the controls and applied left rudder to redirect the airplane back onto the runway.  The CFI said that when she pushed on the left pedal the airplane veered even more toward the right, and it collided with a taxiway sign.  Thereafter, the  CFI elected to continue the takeoff, full engine power was developed, and the airplane took off.  During the climb out both pilots had difficulty maintaining control of the airplane.  The CFI made an emergency landing at the airport on runway 30.  The touchdown, rollout, and taxi to parking were accomplished by the CFI without difficulty.  No unusual sounds, vibrations, or braking problems were noted.  All of the tires remained inflated and an exhaustive examination of the control system, nose wheel steering mechanism and brakes/tires found no evidence of an anomaly.  A series of low and high-speed taxi tests up to 55 knots were performed with the accident airplane under the supervision of FAA Inspectors and the airplane operated normally with no difficulty maintaining directional control.  Cessna Aircraft Company personnel subsequently performed a ground steering test on an exemplar airplane to determine the nose gear operating characteristics as the nose gear (tire) is lifted off the ground.  When the nose strut extends to the point where the tire is no longer resting on the ground, the strut/wheel is designed to center and lock out rudder pedal steering.  The test results noted three specific pitch attitudes:  1) with the center of the leading edge of the elevator approximately 34 inches above the ground, the nose wheel is on the ground, and the strut and wheel turn when the rudder pedals were operated; 2) When the center of the leading edge of the elevator is 29.5 inches above the ground, the nose tire is just touching the ground, and the nose wheel does not turn with application of rudder pedals; 3) when the center of the leading edge of the elevator was about 16 inches above the ground (tailcone tiedown also contacting the ground), the nose wheel was also off the ground and would not move using the ruder pedals.  The FAA reported that the top of the \"J2\" sign was about 34 inches above ground level.  In a normal 3-point resting attitude the airplane's elevator is about 41 inches above ground level .  To contact the top of the taxiway sign, a Cessna T182T needs to pitch upward such that its elevator lowers 7 inches. ",

The fire ignited combustible materials, including insulation blankets and spread upwards toward a flexible oxygen line mounted above the JB-1 junction box.  The flexible oxygen line ignited when exposed to the fire, and the fire burned through the aircraft's fuselage.  Evidence suggests that the fire initiated as a result of an electrical anomaly in the top portion of the JB-1 junction box, near bus bar and contactor components.  This evidence includes melting of one side of the bus bar along the periphery of its connection to a terminal stud and severe thermal damage to the internal and, to a lesser degree, external surfaces of the K1XB contactor case.  Despite the damage to the contactor case, the internal contacts did not appear to be stuck or exhibit signs of melting or excessive pitting.  There were no other signs of arcing near any of these components.Numerous maintenance difficulties had occurred on the aircraft involving the external AC power supply system beginning approximately 10-weeks before the accident.  To attempt to remedy the anomalies, several relays, electrical contactors, the AC power switch, the external ground power receptacle, and other electrical components were removed and replaced with new components.

The pilot was on his second logged flight since obtaining his rotorcraft rating and was on a solo cross-country flight when witnesses reported hearing the engine miss-fire and then quit.  The witnesses saw the helicopter's main rotor blades coning up and then stop rotation completely.  The helicopter fell straight down to a city street below.  The magneto switch was found in the off position with no sign of impact damage to the switch or key.  An evaluation of the crash dynamics, the force vectors involved, and the structural deformation of the helicopter could not explain the magneto switch position.  Witnesses to the accident said the magneto switch was not turned off by anyone after the accident.  Examination of the engine and helicopter systems found no anomalies that would have prevented their normal operation.  The engine roughness heard by the witnesses coupled with the magneto switch position may indicate that the pilot was attempting to diagnose an engine roughness by selectively turning off one magneto at a time and in the process, he may have inadvertently selected the both off position.  The pilot was in the right seat and manipulation of the magneto switch would have required him to take his hand off the collective, which could have resulted in a delay in reacting to the loss of engine power.  Toxicology reports on the pilot showed that chlorpheniramine was detected in blood at a level several times higher than the level expected with a typical maximum single over-the-counter dose of the medication.  Chlorpheniramine is an over-the-counter sedating antihistamine commonly used for cold and allergy symptoms and is present in many over-the-counter multisymptom preparations.  In typical doses, the medication has measurable adverse effects on performance of complex cognitive and motor tasks.  It is likely that the pilot's performance and judgment were impaired by chlorpheniramine.

According to witnesses, the airplane entered a left traffic pattern at the uncontrolled airport for runway 9, although the airport facility directory published pattern is for right traffic.  The witnesses saw the airplane line up on final approach for a parallel taxiway south of runway 9, then it started a go-around.  The airplane performed a continuous left climbing turn to about 1,000 feet above ground level.  While in the turn the airplane appeared to stall, followed by the nose dropping as the airplane entered a 1 1/2 turn spin that continued to ground impact about 5,000 feet northeast of the center of the airport.  The density altitude was calculated at 7,200 feet mean sea level.  A post crash fire thermally destroyed the airplane.  An examination of the ashen remains of the aircraft found no evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure. Toxicological analysis detected diphenhydramine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine in tissue samples from the pilot. Diphenhydramine is an over-the-counter antihistamine, commonly known by the trade name Benadryl, that has sedative effects commonly resulting in drowsiness and measurable negative effects on complex cognitive and motor tasks.  In legal prescription form, amphetamine may be used for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and weight control; methamphetamine may be used for ADHD or severe obesity.  Methamphetamine may also be detected as a result of recent use of a Vick's inhaler, which contains a form of the medication.  There was no blood available for analysis, so it was not possible to determine when the substances might have been taken or whether the pilot was likely to have been impaired by them.  The pilot did not indicate the use of any medications on his most recent application for airman medical certificate, approximately 6 weeks prior to the accident.  The flight originated in New York a few day prior, and made stops in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina, Kansas, and Utah.",

About 30 minutes after departure and while on a visual descent to the destination airport, the flight encountered wake turbulence while descending through 9,300 feet mean sea level for visual approach to the destination airport.  The airplane began a correction back to the right while continuing to bounce.  The airplane rapidly banked 10 degrees when the captain said that he was disengaging the autopilot and autothrottles.  The captain applied left aileron and left rudder to oppose the roll and eventually the first officer began to assist the captain in his control inputs.  The digital flight data recorder showed that the airplane achieved a right 26-degree roll; a left 45-degree control wheel deflection followed by right control wheel deflections.  The rudder pedal deflection achieved a maximum value of left 6.5 degrees which was followed by a right 1.5 degree deflection with corresponding aileron deflections ranging from left 6.0 degrees to right 1.0 degrees.  The pedal then remained deflected to the left over a range from 2.0-0.25 degrees with corresponding left rudder deflections ranging from 2.0-0.25 degrees until the airplane landed. The first officer reported that  A and B hydraulic quantity and pressure gauge indications were normal and there was no change in hydraulic pressure and quantity indication upon completion of each uncommanded rudder checklist item.  The captain stated that during landing roll, about 100 knots indicated airspeed, they heard a banging noise and got a full right deflection of the rudder pedals.  The cockpit voice recorder recording of the flight was not retained by the operator following the incident.  Inspection of the cockpit nose area forward of the main landing gear revealed a wood-handled wire brush.   The first officer's pedal arms contained scuff marks on the paint surface and gouge marks which penetrated the paint surface and metal.  Further inspection with the aid of a borescope revealed the presence of displaced white paint on the structure aft of the pedal arms.  No dents were noted in the vertical structure surrounding the pedal arm.  The UAL party representative stated that work relating to an airworthiness directive was performed weeks prior to the incident.  The brush along with a new brush and the first officer's pedal arms were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory for further examination.  Examination of the first officer's rudder pedal arms and brush revealed that in the vicinity of the bolt heads revealed only light score marks scattered around the edge of the boss, consistent with tool usage.  The right pedal arm contained one score mark on the rear edge of the boss.  The score mark was circumferential for approximately 90 degrees of arc, centered at the horizontal line.  It was more significant above the horizontal and tapered to nothing below it.  Examination of the left, right , top, and bottom faces of the brush handle revealed no indications of any crush damage.  Functional testing and macroscopic visual examination of the rudder power control unit revealed no anomalies.  One estimate of the maximum rudder forces that can be exerted for various positions of rudder pedal range from 246 - 424 lbs depending upon rudder pedal position and distance from back of seat.  Several like brushes were loaded in the lengthwise direction and also placed in various obstructive positions within the pedal arms.  Brushes placed in obstructive positions with a pilot applying rudder pressure estimated that force he applied to the rudder pedals to fracture the brushes was 15-20 pounds.  Brushes loaded in the lengthwise directions broke at loadings from a maximum of 80 pounds and below.  A flight training simulator was back driven at UAL's Flight Training Facility using FDR data from the incident flight with both flight crew members aboard. The simulator structure at the rudder pedals had the same platform/shelf structure as the incident airplane.  The rudder pedals set to the same adjustment as reported by the first officer, and the brush was inserted with the application of left rudder pedal pressure to hold the brush in place due to the resting platform being shorter than the actual airplane.  The brush position for the best strength and holding power was noted when the brush was orientated such that the wire bristles were facing downward and towards the rudder control arms and the convex portion of the brush handle facing upwards with the other end against the vertical wall of the pedal box.  Further pressure on the rudder pedals was not added due to a concern of causing damage to the simulator.  A search of the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s service difficulty reporting system relating to \"Boeing Rudder Controls\" was performed for a time period from January 1, 1997 to February 1, 2002.  One occurrence shows that maintenance could not find any fault with the airplane and that the rudder hydraulic system components were replaced.  A second occurrence shows that after the accomplishment of engineering callouts relating to rudder hydraulic system components, no defects were noted.  A third occurrence noted the replacement of the PCU.",

The private pilot and one passenger were fatally injured. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day visual flight rules conditions prevailed for the flight, which did not operate on a flight plan. The flight originated from the Porter County Regional Airport, near Valparaiso, Indiana, about 1030 and was destined for Oshkosh, Wisconsin.According to preliminary radar data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the airplane appeared on radar about two miles northwest of Hobart Sky Ranch Airport, near Hobart, Indiana, about 1031. The airplane flew along the shore of Lake Michigan until reaching Waukegan, Illinois, and turned inland in a northwest direction about 1106. About 1115, radar data indicated that the airplane turned left and flew west-southwest bound for about 1.5 miles before turning to the right and flew northwest bound again. About 1117, the radar data indicated that the airplane began to turn to the right and its ground speed dropped from 94 to 42 knots in the last 11 seconds of recorded radar data.A witness who was driving on a nearby highway, in part, stated:My sister and I were looking to the left at the scenery we were passingand saw a small white plane do 2 corkscrew type twirls and droppednose down behind the tree line out of sight. We think it occurredapproximately 11:00 a.m. based on the time she picked us up and thetime it would take to get to that point in our journey. We did not seeany explosion or hear any noise during the crash and thought it was alarge model plane since it did not seem like the size of a small mannedplane to us.The accident airplane did not reach its destination and a family member reported that it was missing. Civil Air Patrol members were contacted and were asked to assist in locating the airplane. The airplane was subsequently found in an open field about 670 feet and 65 degrees from the north end of WI95's runway about 1228 on July 26, 2015.The 69-year-old pilot held a FAA private pilot certificate with an airplane single engine land rating. He held a second-class medical certificate that was issued on August 27, 1979, with a limitation that he must wear corrective lenses. The pilot reported on the application for that medical certificate that he had accumulated 250 hours of total flight time and accumulated no flight time in six months prior to that application.N9601, registered as a Sanford Zenith CH 601XL airplane, was an all-metal, side-by-side, two-seat, fixed landing gear airplane. According to FAA airworthiness documents, the accident airplane was produced from a kit by a builder and it received an airworthiness certificate in the Experimental \u2013 Amateur Built category on July 2, 2008. The airplane was powered by a 120-horsepower, Jabiru 3300A engine with serial number 33A 1380, which drove a Sensenich composite, ground adjustable, two-bladed propeller.According to the kit manufacturer's records, an individual purchased the 601XL complete kit in December 2006, which included a leading edge fuel system. A second owner purchased the kit from original owner in November 2009. An upgrade package kit was shipped to a party who installed it for the second owner. The accident pilot purchased CH601XL component kits for the wings, fuel with long-range fuel, wing baggage option, and landing lights. In September 2005, he upgraded to the CH650. In May 2010, he purchased the Mod Kit, Fuselage kit, and in June 2010, the Tail, Finishing and Controls.At 1135, the recorded weather at the Kenosha Regional Airport, near Kenosha, Wisconsin, was: Wind 310 degrees at 9 knots; visibility 10 statute miles; sky condition scattered clouds at 2,000 feet, broken clouds at 4,000 feet; temperature 28 degrees C; dew point 23 degrees C; altimeter 29.94 inches of mercury.The airplane was equipped with a Dynon FlightDEK-D180 unit. The unit's primary functions include attitude, airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, gyro-stabilized magnetic compass, slip/skid ball, turn rate, clock, timers, g-meter, and horizontal situation indicator. This instrument features ADAHRS (Air Data, Attitude and Heading Reference System), which integrates over a dozen solid-state sensors. The unit can continuously monitor up to 27 available sensor inputs that cover the engine, fuel and other miscellaneous systems and annunciate any abnormality immediately upon detection.The airplane was equipped with a Garmin GPSmap 396 unit. The unit has a 3.8-inch display that can show a color moving-map and has terrain alerting features along with satellite datalink graphical weather.The airplane came to rest upright about one-quarter mile and 110 degrees from the intersection of 60th Street and 172nd Avenue. The airplanes resting heading was about 310 degrees. One propeller blade remained intact and attached to its hub and the other blade was broken into three sections. The inboard section remained attached to its hub. The outboard blade section was found embedded in terrain about eight feet north of its hub. The embedded blade section exhibited abrasions perpendicular to the blade's chord. The intact blade exhibited no abrasions. The empennage remained attached to the fuselage. The top of the rudder was displaced rearward and it exhibited a wrinkle deformation below that displacement. The upper surfaces of both wings exhibited wrinkle deformations inboard of their approximate midspans. The forward portion of the fuselage, where it met the canopy, was deformed . The sides of the fuselage above each wing were deformed between the end of the canopy and the firewall. The right wing fuel tank did not contain any fuel and disassembly of its leading edge revealed the right fuel tank was breached. The left fuel tank contained a blue colored liquid that had a smell consistent with aviation gasoline (avgas). The fuel tank selector valve was selecting the left tank. The gascolator contained a liquid consistent with avgas. The carburetor bowl was removed and it contained a blue colored liquid that had a smell consistent with avgas. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit flight controls to their respective flight control surfaces. Both flaps moved in the same direction when each was manipulated by hand. The flap's actuator control rod separated from its flap linear actuator.The Kenosha County Medical Examiner was asked to perform an autopsy on the pilot and passenger and also to take toxicological samples for submission to the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute.Relatives of the pilot were asked for copies of the pilot's logbook and the airplane's logbooks.The Dynon unit and the Garmin GPS unit are being sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Recorder Laboratory for downloading.The engine is being removed and shipped to Jabiru USA facilities for detailed examination.",

The pilot said he only intended to taxi the airplane, and lift off to about 2 inches, but when he applied aft control pressure at 30 mph, it lifted off to about 50 feet and began to turn left.  The pilot indicated he applied right aileron and right rudder to correct the turn, but no change in direction occurred.  He then pulled the control stick aft to gain altitude.  The airplane climbed to 160 feet before descending into trees and a power line, still in a left turn.  A postcrash fire erupted after impact.  The pilot and passenger exited the inverted airplane, and the fire destroyed all aircraft records.  In the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) submitted by the pilot, the pilot indicated that the airplane did not have a mechanical malfunction/failure.  The pilot said he received 1 hour of instruction in the airplane, but did not have a tailwheel endorsement. An FAA inspector examined the airplane at the crash scene and reported that all flight controls were connected, with the exception of a broken left rudder cable.  About 1/2 of the cable strands had a broom-straw appearance.  The airplane's former owner, a certificated mechanic who owned the airplane for 2 months and had flown it once, reported that the airplane only weighed 950 pounds, and was equipped with a 150 horsepower engine for good short takeoff and landing capabilities.  The mechanic reported that the day before the accident, in response to a call from the pilot, he removed a wasp from the pitot tube, and inspected the tailwheel assembly, which functioned properly.  At that time, the mechanic said he warned that pilot about the torque produced by the large engine, and adverse yaw at slow speeds.",

On shallow approach to the runway with hydraulic power off, the instructor told the pilot to fly the helicopter to a designated point on the airfield, at which point, the pilot was to perform a go-around. As the helicopter was \u201cgetting a little slow,\u201d the instructor again mentioned to the pilot that he needed to go around. As the pilot increased power, the helicopter\u2019s nose started rising, and the instructor told the pilot to get the nose down to increase the airspeed. The pilot remarked that it was hard to apply right pedal, so the instructor also manipulated the controls to assist him. At this point, the helicopter had started to turn left, and the instructor applied forward cyclic. The helicopter pitched nose down, and the instructor thought he might have overcompensated. The instructor felt the pilot applying aft cyclic, and the helicopter again pitched nose down, so he made an additional control input to level the helicopter.

When he walked toward the rear of the aircraft he found the flight engineer laying across the top of tail boom with a massive head injury.  The main rotor of the Ch-54A is fully articulated.  The rotor system employs a series of main rotor blade droop stops.  As the rotor rpm slows, centripetal force is reduced and the droop stop springs pull the stops back into ground stop position.  During spool down it can take 20 seconds or more for the first through sixth stop to move into the ground stop position.  The visual strobe effect, caused by the turning rotor head, can make it appear that all the stops are in place when one or more stops still have not yet been fully repositioned.

On this flight, the pilot extended the flaps and was flying slower than on previous flights at a speed he estimated at 50 to 60 miles per hour.  They were following the creek and the pilot was in a turn to the right and then he began a turn back to the left.  The biologist was looking away when he then heard the pilot call out an expletive.  When he looked forward, the airplane was in a right wing and nose down attitude descending toward the ground.  The pilot managed to level the airplane out just before ground impact.  The biologist said he did not hear a change in the engine sounds during the sequence and had not heard the pilot voice any concerns about the way the airplane was handling.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed while maneuvering that led to an inadvertent stall.  A contributing factor in the accident was the low altitude of the flight that reduced the time available for recovery from an upset."

One of the pilots read back the instructions, and then the aircraft entered a left 360 degree turn. Just about the time the aircraft was becoming reestablished on the downwind, the flying pilot allowed the airspeed to decrease below Vs (stalling speed), and the aircraft entered a spin.",
            "probable_cause": "The flying pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed resulting in a stall/spin.   An additional cause was the flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot was flying the third of four scheduled flights for the day and was returning with a passenger to the passenger\u2019s originating airport. The flight was operating in instrument meteorological conditions on an instrument flight rules flight plan. About 45 minutes into the flight, as the airplane neared the destination airport, the pilot advised air traffic control that she would need to enter a holding pattern and wait for the weather conditions at the destination airport to improve. The controller advised the pilot of several other airports with better weather conditions that were between 25 and 40 miles from her destination. The pilot declined the alternatives, and, about 9 minutes after entering the holding pattern, advised the controller that she would like to divert to an airport not far from her original destination, if the weather conditions there were \"good.\" The controller immediately provided the pilot with radar vectors toward the requested diversion airport.The original destination and diversion airports were located about 13 nautical miles (nm) apart, and similar weather conditions prevailed at both airports, including low ceilings and visibilities in mist and fog. After vectoring the flight toward the diversion airport, the controller advised the pilot of the weather conditions. After a brief discussion regarding other flights that recently completed instrument approaches and successfully landed at the diversion airport, the pilot elected to continue to that airport despite the reported weather conditions. The controller provided vectors to the pilot for an instrument landing system approach and informed her that the runway visual range was 4,000 feet, which was above the 1,800-foot required landing minimum for the approach.Radar data indicated that the flight subsequently intercepted, briefly passed through, and then re-intercepted the final approach course before descending and crossing the final approach fix about 200 feet below the published intercept altitude. The flight continued its descent below the glideslope until reaching a point about 3 nm from the runway and 400 feet above the ground, at which time the pilot initiated a missed approach. The airplane climbed to about 700 feet above the ground and then again began to descend. The last radar return showed the airplane about 600 feet above the ground. The airplane impacted the ground about 1,800 feet beyond the last radar return indicating that, during the final seconds of the flight, the airplane entered a steep descent with an average angle of about 18 degrees.The wreckage was located about 2 nm from the runway. The debris path, which was about 600 feet in length and oriented with the runway heading, and the fragmentation of the wreckage indicated that the airplane was traveling at a relatively high airspeed when it impacted the ground. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation, and there was no indication that the airplane struck any objects before it impacted the trees identified as the initial point of the debris path.Analysis of the radar data for the approach portion of the flight showed that the accident airplane trailed another airplane on the instrument landing system approach by an average of 1.5 minutes and about 5 nautical miles. A wake vortex analysis based on the radar-observed positions of both airplanes showed that the accident airplane remained below the calculated wake vortices generated by the airplane ahead until that airplane landed. Additionally, analysis of the accident airplane\u2019s calculated pitch, roll, and heading did not indicate that the airplane encountered a wake vortex. The airplane\u2019s calculated bank angle remained below 10 degrees for at least the final 3 minutes of the flight, and the largest calculated bank angle observed was 6 degrees left after the pilot advised air traffic control that she was initiating a missed approach. The published missed approach procedure included a climbing left turn. Analysis of the last 9 seconds of radar data indicated that the airplane\u2019s groundspeed increased from 109 to 129 knots, while its altitude remained within a 100-foot range. This abrupt increase in speed likely resulted from increased thrust as the pilot initiated the missed approach and increased engine power. During this time, the pilot was vulnerable to a vestibular illusion associated with forward acceleration known as a somatogravic illusion, which causes a false sensation of increased pitch, particularly when flying in low visibility conditions. Further analysis of the airplane\u2019s radar data-based performance showed that the maximum pitch attitude attained during the missed approach was about 13 degrees nose up; however, calculations indicated that the pilot\u2019s maximum vestibular/kinesthetic perception of the airplane\u2019s nose-up pitch may initially have been closer to 19 degrees, which would have prompted her to lower the airplane\u2019s nose. If the pilot lowered the nose in response to a perceived increase in pitch, the airplane would have accelerated even more rapidly, exacerbating the somatogravic illusion and causing the pilot to lower the nose even further. (Analysis showed that the pilot\u2019s perception of the airplane\u2019s pitch likely remained above actual pitch for the remainder of the flight, as perceived pitch decreased from about 19 to 6 degrees nose up.) As a result, the airplane\u2019s final flight path would have approximated a parabolic trajectory. This is consistent with the accident airplane\u2019s transition from a climb to a steep descent.Furthermore, the pilot had only about 13 seconds between the start of the airplane\u2019s final descent and terrain impact; this would have reduced the likelihood of a successful recovery, given that studies have shown that pilots can require 21 to 36 seconds to transition to stable instrument flight after spatial orientation is lost. Therefore, it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation due to a somatogravic illusion and placed the airplane in a nose-low attitude as a result.A review of company records revealed that, in the 6 months before the accident, the pilot performed six instrument approaches, two of which were performed on the morning of the accident flight. In addition, the pilot had conducted a total of seven instrument approaches in the accident airplane type. These numbers suggest that the pilot had only minimal instrument flying proficiency. However, it is difficult to determine the pilot\u2019s level of instrument flying proficiency based solely on recency of experience and the number of instrument approaches conducted in the accident airplane type. Furthermore, even highly experienced, proficient pilots occasionally experience brief episodes of spatial disorientation. The influence of the pilot\u2019s instrument flying proficiency on the pilot\u2019s spatial disorientation could not be determined.Available information indicated that the pilot had a rest opportunity of 7 hours 44 minutes the night before the accident, which was close to her reported sleep need of 8 hours per night. In addition, although the pilot had been on duty for 13 hours by the time of the accident, she received a 5-hour break at an intermediate stop before she began preparing for the accident flight. It is possible she used some of this time to obtain additional rest. Furthermore, the accident occurred at a time of day that is normally associated with high levels of alertness. Thus, the available evidence does not support a conclusion that the pilot\u2019s performance was degraded by fatigue.No blood sample was available for toxicological testing, but tissue specimens were used for ethanol and drug assays. No ethanol was found in any tissue. Sertraline was detected in the liver. Since blood levels for butalbital (detected in the liver and kidney) and promethazine (detected in the kidney) (both of which can cause sedation and impair mental and/or physical ability) were not available, it was not possible to assess the pilot\u2019s level of impairment at the time of the accident. Based on the tissue levels of butalbital, promethazine and sertraline, it was likely that, at some point the day before, or the day of, the accident flight, the pilot ingested these medications. Whether actual blood levels of butalbital and/or promethazine were great enough to interfere with the pilot\u2019s aeronautical decision-making or flying skills at the time of the accident could not be determined.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s spatial disorientation due to a somatogravic illusion while conducting a missed approach in instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in the airplane\u2019s descent into objects and terrain."

He reported that he immediately declared a \"MAYDAY\" and executed a forced landing to a golf course.  During the landing rollout he encountered rough terrain, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine firewall.  The pilot reported that all three wooden propeller blades had separated from the propeller hub.  The inspection of the airplane revealed that the engine exhibited continuity and thumb compression.  The two carburetors were found separated from their respective rubber couplers.  Two of three propeller blades were recovered.  The propeller hub and the two propeller blades were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory for inspection.  The inspection revealed that both blades appeared to be in good condition, with only a few small, shallow dents on the surface and no splintering or other damage to the blade tip or leading edge.  The fracture of the wood of the three propeller blade root ends appeared to have fractured in shear stress.  Calculations indicated that normal operation of the engine would produce a shear stress of 741 psi on the propeller blades.

The airplane was registered to and operated by the private pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) personal cross-country flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and the pilot was not injured. The sole passenger received minor injuries. The airplane departed Gooding Municipal Airport (KGNG), Gooding, Idaho, about 1100 for Kalispell City Airport (S27), Kalispell, Montana, and no flight plan had been filed.During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on August 13, the pilot said that during run-up, prior to departing Gooding, he noted that there was no engine vacuum indication. He took the airplane to a maintenance facility at the Gooding Airport, and the vacuum pump was replaced. Following the repair, all the airplane's systems appeared to be functioning normally, and the pilot departed for Kalispell in the airplane. About 150 miles north of Gooding, the pilot heard an unusual noise from the engine, and noted a loss of engine oil pressure. He turned toward the nearest airport, which was Lemhi County, and made a mayday call on 121.5 Mhz. The pilot believed he had enough altitude and airspeed to make it to the airport. Approaching the airport, it was clear that he would be short of the airport, and he elected to land in a hay field next to the airport. After touchdown in the field, the airplane encountered a road perpendicular to his direction of travel, which collapsed the landing gear, and the airplane slid through the airport's perimeter fence.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to its wings and fuselage. No preaccident mechanical anomalies, with the exception of the vacuum pump replacement, were reported.",
