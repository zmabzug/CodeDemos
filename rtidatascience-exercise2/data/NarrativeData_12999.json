About 1.5 hours after departure, he noticed a strong odor of fuel inside the airplane, and shortly thereafter, the right engine lost power, followed quickly by the left engine.  He said he suspected a fuel stoppage problem and performed emergency procedures by switching fuel tanks and attempting to restart the engines.

According to the pilot, after purchasing the airplane and being briefed on the fuel system, he departed on the first leg of the transcontinental flight.  The fuel system was comprised of a 10 gallon overhead center tank which fed directly into a 2 gallon header tank.  Also incorporated into the system was a 10 gallon right wing tank whose fuel line teed into the center tank's line.  A shutoff valve was incorporated in the \"T\" which would allow both tanks to feed the header tank simultaneously.  Procedures called to use half of the fuel in the center tank before opening a shutoff valve.  On the first leg of the flight the pilot flew 45 minutes before opening the shutoff valve.  After landing approximately 35 minutes later he instructed the fueling attendant to fill both the center and wing tanks so he could judge the consumption of fuel from each tank.  After fueling was completed the attendant advised the pilot that he had put 8.5 gallons of fuel in the center tank, and that the wing tank was full.  The pilot commented that this wasn't right, but voiced no further concerns and departed on the next leg of the flight, a distance of about 90 nautical miles.  About one hour into the flight the pilot opened the wing tank shut off valve, and when he was about an hour and 30 or 40 minutes into the flight while descending he encountered a \"surge\" in the engine.  The pilot added carburetor heat with no success, and when the engine quit completely he elected to land in a wheat field.  After touching down and impacting a plow rut the airplane nosed over and came to rest on its back in an inverted position, resulting in substantial damage to the airplane's vertical stabilizer.  The pilot stated that he felt the reason for the engine failure was due to fuel exhaustion as a result of fuel being vented from the wing tank, which resulted in fuel from the center tank being sucked into and replacing the fuel in the wing tank.  Further examination by the FAA failed to reveal any fuel present at the accident site.  It was also noted that the installation of the wing tank was a modification of the airplane, which required a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC).  A search by the FAA failed to reveal an STC for this aircraft relative to the right wing tank installation.  The inspector also supervised an engine test run with no anomalies noted.

The breach occurred in the turbine plane, between approximately the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions.  Debris from the breach resulted in collateral damage to the numbers 2 and 3 engines, the fuselage, and the left landing gear.  In May 1993, the engine manufacturer issued a service bulletin to replace existing nozzle locks with ones that had thicker posts and arms.  The change required modification of the LPT case nozzle lock holes.  In March 1994, the manufacturer issued another service bulletin, SB 72-1082, which introduced a newly designed nozzle lock.  The new locks, which were installed on the accident engine, utilized original diameter stud shanks, but were manufactured from a different material, and did not require modification of the LPT case.  There were two previously reported failures of SB 72-1082 LPT nozzle locks, discovered during routine under-cowl inspections.  In one case, all of the 2nd-stage nozzle locks were broken.  The nozzle segments had rotated 120 degrees within the LPT case, but the case itself was not breached.  In the second case, two 4th-stage nozzle locks had failed, but there was no collateral damage.  According to the engine manufacturer, the failures were intergranular, \"suggesting either stress rupture or sustained peak low cycle fatigue.\"  Safety Board examination, of the only two recovered 2nd-stage nozzle locks from the accident engine, along with a section of casing with a nozzle lock stud attached, revealed intergranular fracture features, degradation at the surface of the fracture features, and grain boundaries, typical of oxidation damage.  The intergranular fractures and oxidation damage found at the grain boundaries were consistent with stress rupture.  An examination of a cracked 2nd stage nozzle lock, from a comparison engine, also revealed oxidation and intergranular fracture features, consistent with stress rupture. ",

Upon reaching cruise altitude, both left and right engine fuel selectors were turned from the main fuel tanks to the auxiliary tanks. Shortly after selecting the auxiliary tanks, the left engine lost power.  Power was restored after the fuel selector was returned to the main tank, and the CFI elected to continue the flight.  During approach to land at the destination airport, the CFI simulated a left engine failure by reducing power on that engine to \"zero thrust.\"  The left propeller was intentionally not feathered.  While on the base leg, about to turn final, the left engine began to surge, pulling the airplane away from the airport.  The CFI stated that he took the controls, and increased power on both engines, but the airplane continued to move away from the runway.  He stated that the left engine continued to surge, and the right engine began to lose power.  He indicated that he turned the boost pumps for both engines from the low to \"ON\" (high) position without any noticeable difference in power.

The pilot reported that he also heard the tower controller tell an inbound helicopter to follow him. Review of a recording of the tower communications revealed that the controller actually instructed the helicopter to pass behind the airplane and cleared the helicopter to land on taxiway H in the opposite direction of the airplane. (Taxiway H was south of and parallel to runway 28L with a taxiway centerline to runway centerline distance of about 200 feet.) About 1 1/2 minutes later, the tower controller told the airplane pilot that there was a helicopter on his left side and that it would be landing on the taxiway adjacent to the runway. The airplane pilot did not acknowledge the transmission. The airplane pilot said that he was planning to fly the airplane low over the runway and land long to expedite his ground taxi. As the airplane pilot flew low over the approach end of the runway, he was surprised to see the helicopter flying towards him. He thought it was flying over the edge of his runway and that its rotor wash would impact his airplane. However, radar data from an antenna located on the airport indicated that the two aircraft were horizontally separated by about 300 feet when they passed each other at a point about 885 feet from the approach end of the runway. Additionally, the helicopter pilot reported that his landing on taxiway H was accomplished about 300 feet from the airplane.The airplane pilot stated that just as he was passing the helicopter, his left wing tip was violently slammed down. The airplane veered right about 30 to 40 degrees, stalled, and impacted the ground. A witness observed the airplane's left wing strike the runway before the airplane veered right off the runway and over the grass. Airport operations personnel located a yellow paint transfer mark on the runway surface about 1,616 feet from the approach end of the runway. The location and paint color of the transfer mark were consistent with the airplane's left wing tip impacting the runway when the airplane's fuselage was over the runway's right edge. Radar data indicated that, at the time the airplane produced the mark, the helicopter was more than 1,350 feet away.At the time, the airplane was landing with a direct crosswind of about 6 knots from the left.The FAA Aeronautical Information Manual states that \"Pilots of small aircraft should avoid operating within three rotor diameters of any helicopter in a slow hover taxi or stationary hover.\" Since this helicopter's main rotor disc diameter was about 33.5 feet, the recommended distance to maintain from small airplanes in order to prevent downwash encounters was about 100 feet. Additionally, a representative from the helicopter manufacturer's safety department said that a helicopter descending during air taxiing and with a forward speed of about 58 mph, the helicopter's ground speed when it passed the airplane, would produce significantly less downwash relative to what it would produce when static hovering or hover taxiing.",

During the landing roll the nose landing gear sunk into the soft ground and the airplane nosed-over coming to rest in an inverted position.  The pilot was able to exit the airplane unassisted.  A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector responded to the accident site and examined the airplane.

He died as a result of the accident, and was found about 10 feet from the aircraft. The accident aircraft was found near a railroad track by the crew of a passing train. According to his logbook entries, the pilot had 233 hours of powered flight experience, and logged 4.5 hours of flight in the past 15 months. According to a friend, the accident flight was his first flight of this year. No evidence of a current required aircraft annual condition inspection was discovered. The pilot had replaced the aircraft\u2019s original engine with a more powerful 100 horsepower engine, and it was also equipped with a digital video camera mounted on the forward support strut facing forward. A review of the accident flight video showed the control tube upper support cables moving in and out of the left and right sides of the camera\u2019s field of view. The nose of the aircraft and the single front ski could also be seen in the video. Before the accident, the aircraft was flying at a low altitude over snow-covered flats to the west of the accident site. It made a steep climbing right turn to the east and continued to climb at a very steep angle. The angle of bank approached 90 degrees relative to the horizon, the climb appeared to stop, and the nose fell through the horizon rapidly. A frame-by-frame review showed that prior to the nose falling through the horizon, the wind screen was pushed forward into the cameras field of view, and then to the left, indicating that the aircraft was descending backward. The camera recorded an event consistent with a aerodynamic tumble. During the tumble, the camera mount broke and the camera drifted away and fell alongside the tumbling aircraft, continuing to record the aircraft. The aircraft had been equipped with automotive style lap belts and shoulder harnesses, with plastic push-button receiver type buckles. The pilot's lap belt buckle came apart during the tumble, likely due to the airframe flexing between the shoulder harness mast attachment and the floor mounted lap belt attachment, which placed a tension load on the pilot's lap belt buckle. The camera attained a position below the aircraft, and showed the pilot separate from the aircraft above the treetops. The accident aircraft was originally constructed as a two-place ultralight trainer, and later transitioned to experimental light sport category aircraft. Transitioned aircraft were not subject to the construction standards of ELSA, and therefore there was no standard for occupant restraint systems.",

An FAA Inspector who responded to the accident stated that the pilot had not been granted a Special Airworthiness certificate permitting it to be flown, because there were yet outstanding items that remained to be performed in order to satisfy FAA requirements. A witness stated that the airplane had been operating normally other than for the brakes, and the pilot who was also an FAA licensed mechanic, took off, intending to taxi the airplane to see if the repairs he had done to the brakes had been successful in correcting \"a pull\" to the right that had been occurring when taxiing the airplane.

According to an FAA inspector who responded to the accident, a third witness stated that he observed the airplane while it was flying southbound it did not sound as if it was operating properly. The inspector further stated that the witness told him that it sounded as if the engine was not generating power and he saw it about a 20 to 30 degrees nose high attitude. The inspector said the witness said the airplane was in the vicinity of a big open field with plenty of room in either direction, and he saw the landing gear extend and then retract, followed by the airplane entering about a 90 degree \"knife edged\" turn to the left, as if trying to return to the airport when it descended, impacting the ground.

The flight instructor then asked the student to turn onto the base leg of the traffic pattern, but \u201che was slow to respond,\u201d and the airplane was too fast, which extended the downwind leg farther out than normal. The flight instructor then noticed that the student had not extended the wing flaps to the 10-degree position. The student pilot then extended the wing flaps to 10 degrees and started to slow the airplane. The flight instructor then asked the student to turn onto final, and, because of the extended downwind leg, to stop descending and add power. The student then arrested the descent, but he failed to add power as instructed. The flight instructor again asked the student to add power; however, the student did not respond by either adding power or by asking the flight instructor for clarification. The flight instructor stated that he was distracted by the airplane\u2019s airspeed and altitude and the student\u2019s lack of response and that he did not see the power lines during the final approach even though he had flown over them many times.

Examination of the power lines revealed that not only were they below the runway\u2019s 7.00-degree glidepath that was provided by a pulsating visual approach slope indicator to ensure obstacle clearance but that they were also below the obstruction identification surfaces listed in federal regulations, and, in many areas, they were at or below the trees located on the approach end of the runway.

The pilot contacted the tower at the intended point of landing 2 miles away, and they notified him of winds gusting to 21 knots.  The wind was calm at the balloon's location, but the pilot decided to land.  Before he could get the balloon to the ground, the winds increased rapidly.  The balloon hit the ground and went through a fence prior to a hard collision with the steep bank of a creek.  The pilot was ejected as he tried to deflate the balloon, and the copilot landed the balloon.  It hit hard and the basket turned onto its side.  The balloon Flight Manual (FM) requires the balloon to be equipped with helmets for each passenger and recommends that they be worn during landings in winds 10 mph or greater.  It instructs the pilot to brief passengers on proper use prior to flight.  The pilot did not have enough helmets on board to equip every passenger, did not brief the passengers that they were available, and did not brief them on the equipment's proper use.  About 3 hours before the flight, the pilot contacted a Flight Service Station for weather information at his destination.

One of the three ground crewmembers reported that, for this flight, the pilot wanted to test the airplane\u2019s G limits, perform stalls, and conduct touch-and-go takeoffs and landings. While the pilot was flying the airplane in the traffic pattern, two of the ground crewmembers observed the airplane perform an unscheduled roll. About 1 minute later, they observed the airplane perform a second roll. One of the ground crewmembers reported that, about midway through the second roll, the pilot lost airplane control, and the ballistic parachute subsequently deployed with the airplane traveling at a high rate of speed; almost immediately after deployment, the parachute separated from the airframe. The airplane then spun toward the ground and was destroyed by impact forces.\u000b\u000bThe Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook (POH) contained a warning that aerobatics and intentional spins were prohibited. The POH also indicated that the minimum deployment altitude for the parachute was 210 ft and recommended that the parachute be deployed at the lowest airspeed possible and not above 150 mph; the airplane was operating at the airport\u2019s traffic pattern altitude of about 1,000 ft above ground level when the parachute deployed. The airplane\u2019s never-exceed speed was 131 mph; the\u00a0airplane\u2019s actual speed at the time of the parachute\u2019s deployment could not be determined. Although the airplane was likely traveling within the speed and altitude specified for parachute deployment, the pilot was performing a prohibited roll when it deployed.All of the parachute system\u2019s hardware was accounted for during the postaccident examination of the system. The examination of the three parachute lines that were attached to the fuselage per the kit specifications revealed that two of the lines had been cut and that the third line exhibited overstress fractures. It is likely that the lines were severed when the parachute was deployed during the roll and that the remaining line then failed due to overload. Due to the severity of the damage and fragmentation of the airframe, it could not be determined if the pilot intentionally deployed the parachute following the loss of control during the roll maneuver or if a malfunction occurred that caused the parachute to deploy unintentionally. Once the parachute separated, the airplane was likely uncontrollable. \u000b\u00a0\u000bAlthough postaccident toxicological tests detected chlorpheniramine, a sedating antihistamine, in the pilot\u2019s cavity, it is unlikely that the pilot was impaired at the time of the accident.\u00a0",

Since the destination airport did not have any weather reporting capability, the pilot had to rely on weather from an airport 23 miles away and further inland. The weather conditions deteriorated while en route (ceiling 1,000 to 1,200 foot overcast, visibility 9-10 miles, and a closing temperature/dewpoint spread) so the pilot filed an instrument-flight-rules flight plan with air traffic control (ATC). As he approached his destination, the pilot asked ATC if he could descend to 2,000 feet and \"take a look.\" The controller approved the descent at the pilot's discretion. ATC later cleared the pilot for a visual approach since no instrument approach procedures were available for the airport. The pilot was instructed to descend to 1,600 feet and to report when the airport was in sight. The pilot acknowledged that he had the airport in sight and there were no further communications with him. Radar data revealed the airplane flew southeast toward the airport at an altitude of 800 feet, then flew beyond the airport before it made a left turn toward the shoreline. The last recorded altitude was 600 feet. A witness who lived near the airport heard the airplane flying low over his home and went outside, but he was unable to see the airplane due to heavy haze and reduced visibility. He said the airplane noise traveled toward the shoreline and disappeared. The airplane came to rest inverted in approximately 7-10 feet of water about 1.6 miles east of the airport. Damage to the airplane was consistent with a shallow impact angle with the water, the subsequent recovery operations, and salt water corrosion. All four blades (two on each engine) exhibited symmetrical aft bending and twisting toward low pitch (not feathered), consistent with water impact at low or moderate power.

The pilot lowered the collective and stabilized the helicopter. The engine was running normally, but there was no response from the anti-torque pedals, and the pilot realized he had a possible tail rotor failure.

Therefore, the lack of climb performance should have been a clear indicator to the pilot to abort the takeoff, which he could have safely performed within the remaining runway distance.\u000b\u000bAccounting for environmental conditions but excluding any issue related to inefficiency of the accident airplane\u2019s engines, propellers, or airframe, the single-engine and both-engine rate-of-climb at design gross weight would have been about 160- and 960 feet per minute, respectively. No determination could be made as to the actual values for the accident airplane. The operation of the airplane above the design gross weight would have further decreased the single-engine climb performance, although the exact decrease in performance could not be determined.\u000b",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to abort the takeoff after detecting the airplane\u2019s degraded performance. Contributing to the accident were the likely loss of power from the left engine for reasons that could not be determined during the postaccident examination of the engine, and the operation of the airplane above the design gross weight, which resulted in decreased single-engine performance."

The visibility minimum for the GPS approach was 1 mile.  En route to the airport, the automated weather observation system (AWOS) was reporting a visibility of 1.5 miles.  The pilot began the global positioning system (GPS) approach to runway 06.  Two miles from the runway, the pilot saw the runway and decided to circle to land on runway 24.  While turning base for runway 24, the pilot lost sight of the runway and discontinued the landing approach.  The pilot was cleared for another GPS approach to runway 06.  At 1.5 miles from the runway, the pilot saw the runway and continued the landing approach.  About 20 feet agl, the pilot experienced flat light conditions that limited his view of the runway so that he could only distinguish the runway lights as his landing reference. The airplane touched down about 1,700 feet beyond the approach end of runway 06.  The airplane encountered about 2 feet of snow on the runway, pulled to the right, and came to a stop about 3,000 feet beyond the approach end.

Anticipating an uphill landing, the pilot misjudged the beginning of runway 30 as it was lower in elevation than he expected. He remarked that he was high and fast on the final approach leg and could not perform a go-around due to tall trees at the end of the runway. After the airplane touched down, the pilot applied brakes; however, the airplane slid across the grass strip. He then guided the airplane to the right to avoid trees, but the airplane continued until the left wing impacted a tree and came to rest. A postaccident examination by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the left wing. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.",

The student pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the flight that departed Winter Haven's Gilbert Airport (GIF), Winter Haven, Florida, at 1330. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. In his written statement, the pilot reported that he flew the airport pattern at GIF multiple times before departing on the accident flight. The pilot then checked notams and subsequently embarked on a flight to a private grass strip. After an uneventful flight and about one half mile north of the pilot's destination, the pilot began a descent from 500 feet above ground level (agl). Almost immediately the pilot felt the cyclic move to the left. He attempted to hold the cyclic center with \"all he had.\" According to a witness, about 25 feet agl the helicopter rolled left and the rotor blades impacted the ground. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that the helicopter came to rest on its right side and had sustained substantial damage to the tail boom and fuselage.The helicopter was equipped with a Rotorway RI600N 150 hp reciprocating engine that was assembled by the pilot with assistance from a mechanic using Rotorway furnished components. The airworthiness certificate was issued in November 14, 2014 and denoted that the helicopter was an experimental amateur built category aircraft. The two place helicopter was equipped with a two-blade main rotor and a two-blade tail rotor.A postaccident examination was conducted by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector. Cyclic continuity was confirmed from the cockpit to the swashplate. Both main rotor blades remained intact: blade A was bent down at a 45 degree angle and blade B was twisted aft about 30 degrees. The cockpit displayed some vertical crush damage. The tail rotor remained intact; however, the tail boom had separated from the fuselage forward of the horizontal stabilizer.

He and the CFI departed earlier in the morning and had conducted touch and go landings at three different airports to include the accident airport before they stopped to refuel the airplane. After refueling the airplane he and the CFI took off and flew back to the accident airport to do more touch and go landings. The pilot stated, \"both my instructor and I were aware of the power lines.\" They entered the traffic pattern and the pilot made another touch and go landing. The pilot remained in closed traffic, turned final approach for the second touch and go landing, and the airplane collided with the power lines. The power lines separated, the airplane collided with the runway, and collapsed the main landing gear. When asked why the airplane collided with the power lines, the pilot stated, \"we simply did not see them on this approach.\"",
            "probable_cause": "The certified flight instructor and commercial pilot receiving instruction failure to maintain a visual look out, resulting in a wire strike on final approach, and collapse of the main landing gear on touchdown."

The pilot took off, climbed to about 400 feet msl, and accelerated to 90 knots. The first minute of flight was routine, and the pilot did not indicate he was experiencing any malfunctions. Suddenly, a loud bang was heard which was followed by a slight shudder in the tail rotor pedals. A passenger reported observing pieces of the tail rotor blades flying past the left side of the helicopter. The pilot applied pressure to the tail rotor pedals, but no response was evident. The pilot autorotated to a landing on rough terrain covered with vegetation. The helicopter was recovered and examined. No evidence of mechanical problems was found. The tail rotor blade assembly was not located. Prior to the flight, the helicopter's doors had been removed. Also, 2 days earlier, company maintenance personnel had replaced one of the two tail rotor pitch change links due to excessive wear in its rod end bearing. ",
            "probable_cause": "failure of the tail rotor for undetermined reason(s), resulting in tail rotor imbalance, separation of the tail rotor, and an autorotative landing on rough terrain with high vegetation.  The lack of suitable terrain for a forced landing was a related factor. "

The pilot was unable to keep it from going further to the right, and as it continued to veer to the right of the runway heading, the left main gear leg collapsed, resulting in damage to the fuselage structure. There were no malfunctions or anomalies in the airplane's flight control or tail wheel steering systems.

The chafed hole was in the area of the unsecured throttle cable.  The hydraulic line had been repaired in 1980 by splicing in an additional piece and was 1/2 inch longer than a new hydraulic line.  A new hydraulic line, when installed, had adequate clearance with the throttle cable. ",
