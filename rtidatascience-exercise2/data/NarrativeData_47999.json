The route of flight was over ocean waters, flanked by steep vertical cliffs to the waters edge.  After passing over the last suitable landing site, an airport about 12 miles north, the accident pilot reported to the pilot of the second airplane that he had a severe engine oil leak, and was retuning to the airport.  The pilot reported that once the oil stopped leaking, about 3 miles from the airport, the engine began to vibrate so violently that he thought the engine was going to be torn from its mounts, and he shut the engine off.  He said he turned the airplane in an attempt to glide to the nearest beach, but he was unable to reach the beach, and was forced to ditch the airplane about 300 yards from shore.  When the airplane's main landing gear wheels touched the water, it nosed over abruptly, and the cabin rapidly filled with water.  The pilot said he struggled to free himself and the passengers from their seat belts, while upside-down, and submerged in cold ocean water.  Once he was free, he swam to the rear of the airplane, kicked out one of the aft windows, swam to the surface, and summoned help.  Rescue personnel discovered the two passengers still restrained within their seats.  A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that a hex head plug at the front of the engine, in front of the propeller governor idler gear shaft, was missing, allowing engine oil under pressure to flow overboard.  Additionally, the propeller governor idler gear shaft setscrew was loose, and the idler gear shaft was missing.  There was no evidence that the hex head plug had been safety wired as required at the last engine overhaul, 299.6 service hours prior to the accident.  According to the owner/pilot, he and a friend assembled the overhauled components of the accident engine in the pilot/owner's home-based shop.  He said that that all work was accomplished in accordance with Textron Lycoming technical data.  The pilot/owner did not possess an aviation mechanic's certificate.

Another operator had a fleet of 44 airplanes. This fleet\u2019s airplanes accumulated 13 cracked NLG forks in 17 months. According to a fleet representative, their normal procedure for reporting failed parts was to submit the information directly to the manufacturer, instead of submitting a SDR. The airplane\u2019s manufacturer recommended the installation of screws in the bolt holes used to secure the fairing to the NLG fork, which reportedly reduced a stress concentration point. The airplane manufacturer published a Service Information Letter (SIL), which depicted a replacement NLG fork assembly, and described the installation process. The SIL also referred owners to the maintenance manual for new inspection requirements that require the NLG to be inspected every 100 hours as opposed to the previous 6,000-hour inspection cycle. The National Transportation Safety Board issued recommendations to the FAA to encourage \"all persons or organizations that operate under 14 CFR Parts 43 and 91 to submit Malfunction or Defect Reports ... and to ... encourage foreign regulatory agencies to provide service difficulty data from resident operators and manufacturers to the FAA for incorporation into the FAA service difficulty data base.\"",

The owner/pilot was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The sport pilot and passenger were fatally injured; the airplane was destroyed by impact forces. The cross-country personal flight departed Big Creek, Idaho, about 1440, with a planned destination of Dixie, Idaho. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.The pilot was in possession of a personal Spot GPS satellite tracker unit. When the pilot failed to check in with his family, they logged into the Spot tracker system and determined the last tracker location. The family contacted the Idaho County Sheriff's department who initiated a search and rescue. The FAA issued a family concern ALNOT on August 5, 2014, at 2326 MDT.The airplane wreckage was located on August 6, 2014, adjacent to the last reported tracker location.A review of the Spot tracker data indicated the following times and locations of the flight on the day of the accident. The pilot and passenger had departed on the third day of the multi-day flight into the back country of Idaho. On the day of the accident they had departed from Sulphur Creek Ranch Airport, (ID74), Cascade, Idaho, at about 1100 MDT.At 1129 MDT, the flight landed at Upper Loon Creek airstrip (U72), and departed at 1149 MDT.At 1209 MDT, the flight landed at Lower Loon Creek airstrip (C53), and departed at 1309 MDT.At 1419 MDT, the flight landed at Big Creek airstrip (U60), and departed at 1439 MDT. U60 is located 5 NM southeast of the accident site.The Spot tracker is configured such that while in tracking mode, the unit sends location information every 10 minutes unless the position is stationary, then it defaults to every 60 minutes.At 1600 MDT, the first track point was recorded located at the accident site. The track points continued to be recorded in the area of the accident site until 2230 MDT when the batteries were depleted.WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATIONInvestigators examined the wreckage at the accident scene. The accident site was located in a remote area of the Payette National Forest. The wreckage was located in the center of a previous wild land fire area of 70- to 80-foot tall trees of which most were dead. The wreckage site was on a 20- to 25-degree slope facing south. The first identified point of contact (FIPC) was a tree that had impact damage about 33 feet up from the base of the tree and was uprooted and lying within the main wreckage.

About 0930, the captain transmitted to air traffic control (ATC) that the flight was climbing through 11,700 feet to its cruise altitude of flight level (FL) 210 (approximately 21,000 feet mean sea level.) The controller acknowledged the transmission and cleared the flight to proceed to an intersection along the flight route located about 29 miles north-northwest of the destination airport, and the flight crew acknowledged. At 0933, during cruise flight, the controller repeated the navigational clearance, which the flight crew acknowledged, and the airplane turned in accordance with the clearance. At 0940, the controller instructed the flight to change radio frequencies, and there was no response. The controller continued to try to contact the flight crew multiple times but received no reply. At 0951, the airplane crossed the intersection that was its clearance limit then turned southeast toward the destination airport without descending, which is consistent with the airplane being on autopilot. The controller handling the flight asked another controller to attempt to contact the flight crew on a different frequency, but there was still no response, and the flight proceeded on a southeasterly heading at FL 210. About 0955, the flight crossed over the destination airport and continued on a southeasterly course without changing altitude or heading. Two separate airline crews in the area attempted to contact the incident crew, but neither flight crews\u2019 attempts were successful. About 0958, when the flight was about 26 nautical miles southeast of the destination airport, the captain contacted the controller with an abbreviated call sign (\u201cAh HCF ten zero two\u201d), and the controller asked if the flight crew was experiencing an emergency. The captain responded, \"No, we must have missed a hand off or missed a call or something.\" The controller then issued instructions for the flight to return to the destination airport, with which the flight crew complied. The flight arrived without further incident about 1015. The captain and first officer both reported to their company that they had unintentionally fallen asleep in flight. The fact that both pilots fell asleep during the midmorning hours, a time of day normally associated with wakefulness and rising alertness, indicates that both pilots were fatigued. The captain had undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea, which was diagnosed during a medical evaluation shortly after this incident and for which symptoms (such as snoring) and risk factors (such as obesity) were present before the incident. This condition likely caused him to experience chronic daytime fatigue and contributed to his falling asleep during the incident flight. In addition, the day of the incident was the third consecutive day that both pilots started duty at 0540. This likely caused the pilots to receive less daily sleep than is needed to sustain optimal alertness and resulted in an accumulation of sleep debt and increased levels of daytime fatigue. The first officer stated he needed between 7.5 and 8 hours of sleep per night to feel rested. He estimated that he had spent about 7 hours 25 minutes in bed the night before the incident, and about 6 hours 55 minutes in bed during each of the previous two nights. Thus, the first officer\u2019s self-reported sleep history indicated an accumulated sleep debt of between 1 hour 15 minutes and 2 hours 45 minutes in the 72 hours before the incident. The first officer\u2019s reduced sleep probably resulted from the flight crew\u2019s recent work schedule. The effect of early start times on sleep is well documented. A 1998 National Aeronautics and Space Administration Report, \u201cFlight Crew Fatigue II: Short-haul fixed wing air transport operations,\u201d for example, concluded that requiring early report times makes it more difficult for crewmembers to obtain adequate sleep. Further, a 1998 report published by North Atlantic Treaty Organization Research and Technology Organization (formerly AGARD), \u201cEarly starts: Effects on sleep, alertness, and vigilance,\u201d concluded that pilots reporting before 0600 had a significantly shorter total sleep time, impaired sleep quality, and impaired performance both pre-flight and at top of descent. The pilots also were flying eight legs a day, requiring many takeoffs and landings, which are high-workload phases of flight.The incident pilots\u2019 lack of adequate sleep, together with the low workload associated with the cruise phase of the flight, likely contributed to the pilots inadvertently falling asleep.",
            "probable_cause": "The captain and first officer inadvertently falling asleep during the cruise phase of flight. Contributing to the incident were the captain's undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and the flight crew\u2019s recent work schedules, which included several consecutive days of early-morning start times."

Over the last 2 hours of the flight, the pilot had experienced difficulty maintaining his assigned altitude and had reported to controllers that he was in moderate turbulence.  On one occasion the flight descended below the minimum en route altitude and had difficulty in climbing back to the assigned cruise altitude; however, the pilot continued flying toward his flight planned destination. Just before the accident, the flight's clearance was to maintain 14,000 feet.  Recorded radar data indicates that at 1711:28 the airplane had descended to 13,800 feet, and 12 seconds later at the time of the last radar hit, the airplane had descended to 13,200 feet, which was an average descent rate of approximately 3,000 feet/minute.  During the uncontrolled descent, the airplane impacted upsloping 5,770-foot mean sea level (msl) terrain in a nose down pitch attitude, about 2 miles from its last recorded radar location.  The accident occurred about 53 nautical miles from the pilot's destination airport, and after the pilot had been en route nearly 5 hours.  Prior to departure, the pilot called FSS for a weather briefing and told the specialist that he \"had been on DUATS\" and just needed an overview.  FSS personnel informed the pilot that thunderstorms and snow showers were forecast over portions of his planned route including the general area encompassing his destination.  No specific mention of turbulence or any mention of mountain wave conditions was provided to the pilot.  The NWS's AIRMET that was in effect had not been upgraded to mention the possibility of severe turbulence or the mountain wave condition, despite pilot reports of these types of adverse weather conditions over a wide geographic area.  Within a few minutes of the accident, an airport located 23 nautical miles from the crash site reported its surface wind was 19 knots with 32-knot gusts.  The visibility was between 0.5 and 1.0 miles in moderate snow and freezing fog; the vertical visibility was between 100 and 900 feet; the temperature was 30 degrees Fahrenheit; and the altimeter setting was 29.78 inches of Mercury.   A witness who was located 1 mile from the accident site reported a mixture of snow and rain (sleet) was present and was blowing nearly horizontally at the time, which precluded her from seeing the accident.  The pilot's turbocharged and supplemental oxygen-equipped airplane had the capability of cruising at 20,000 feet msl.

The private pilot was not injured, the passenger/owner sustained minor injuries; there were no ground injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight that was destined for Missoula, Montana. No flight plan had been filed.According to the owner of the airplane, he had purchased the airplane about 2 weeks prior to the accident. The owner reported that the annual inspection had taken place in August 2014. On January 16, 2015, the owner called Executive Aviation, a fixed based operator (FBO), and requested that the airplane be topped off with  aviation fuel; the airplane was refueled with 26.3 gallons of fuel. The owner stated that the airplane had been tied down on the tarmac since August and had accrued about 2.19 hours since the annual inspection. He reported that the preflight inspection and run-up seemed normal. The airplane rotated at 65 miles per hour (mph), and during the climb out, the engine started to \"sag, until nothing.\" The engine had been running and then quit. He stated that the pilot attempted to maneuver away from houses, but they were headed toward the ground.According to the pilot, he performed a thorough preflight inspection, which included checking the flight controls, and fuel and fuel sumps; no discrepancies were noted. They turned on the engine and while it was warming up, he contacted ground control for a clearance to taxi to the active runway for departure. The ground controller cleared him to taxi the airplane to runway 27, where he commenced with an engine run-up. The pilot reported no problems with the run-up. He stated that the airplane rotated at 65 mph. During the climb out, he stated that it was quiet; the engine was not developing full power. The pilot stated that there was no safe place to land straight ahead, and as the engine was still running, he decided to turn back for the airport. The pilot stated that they were about 350-400 feet above the ground and the engine was developing 2,300 rpms when he made a shallow left turn to return to the airport. According to the pilot, the airplane could not maintain altitude or airspeed, and it impacted a house.An officer from the Helena Police Department reported that the airplane struck power lines, a tree, a propane tank, and came to rest in a shed and adjacent house.The responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector reported that both of the airplane's wings had separated from the airframe.",

As the flight instructor leveled the helicopter to land, he closed the throttle, added more collective, and contacted the ground in a sideward motion and rolled over.  Examination of the helicopter revealed that the upper tail rotor shaft had completely sheared off at the upper bevel gear bolt hole.  A review of the maintenance records revealed the helicopter had previously experienced two hard landings and this was the second time the shaft had failed.  In a separate incident, another B-2B owner reported an upper tail rotor shaft failure while in a low hover.  However, there was no history of any hard landings.  Both failed upper tail rotor shafts were sent to the Safety Board's Materials Laboratory, Washington DC, for examination.  Results of the examination revealed that both upper shafts failed due to fatigue at the bolt hole where the shaft attached to the bevel gear.  The area outside both bolt holes exhibited fretting, gouging and pitting, which resulted in a fatigue crack and subsequent torsional shear of the shafts.  The manufacturer conducted an engineering study and concluded that the most probable cause for the upper tail rotor shafts failing was excessive misalignment due to external forces or improper maintenance.  A review of the maintenance manual revealed there was information for inspections after a hard landing but there were no specific procedures for checking the alignment of the upper tail rotor shaft.  As a result of the investigation, the manufacturer issued Service Bulletin Number 105: Tail Rotor Drive System Inspection, which directed owners to inspect the condition of the upper tail rotor shaft and parts in that assembly.  In addition, they issued Service Instruction Number 10, which described maintenance procedures to remove, disassemble and then reassemble and install the upper tail rotor gearbox.  At the time of this report, the manufacturer was scheduled to release Service Instructions Number 11 and 12, and also Service Bulletin Number 106.  They have requested the FAA to upgrade Service Bulletin Number 106 to an Airworthiness Directive (AD), which would require all owners to inspect the dimensions that affect the alignment of the upper tail rotor shaft.  If any of the shafts were found to have operated outside of the alignment tolerances they would have to be replaced.",

The non-instrument rated private pilot departed, at night, to an airport located about 40 miles to the north.  While en route, the pilot contacted the terminal radar approach control (TRACON) specialist on duty and was subsequently advised that weather conditions were IFR at the pilot's intended destination airport.  The pilot responded by saying he was going to try to find a VFR route.  A review of archived radar data revealed that the accident airplane flew to various locations around the accident airport at altitudes above the underlying overcast cloud layer.  The pilot then contacted the TRACON specialist and requested the ILS runway 16R approach at the accident airport.  A review of air-to-ground communications tapes, transcripts, and archived radar data, revealed that the accident pilot was unable to intercept the glide slope and localizer for the ILS approach to runway 16R, or to maintain an assigned altitude or heading.  Examination of the radar data for the pilot's attempted ILS approach showed that the airplane crossed the final approach course, 161 degrees, from the west between the initial approach fix and the outer marker.  The airplane's track overshot the final approach course to the east and then corrected back so that it was on course at the outer marker.  The track then deviated to the east again and corrected back to the final approach course, which was then followed by a 90-degree turn away from the final approach course to the west.  The track proceeded westerly for 27 seconds, climbing from 2,100 to 2,500 feet and then down to 2,400 feet.  The track turned south for 32 seconds, climbing from 2,400 feet to 3,000 feet.  The last leg of the track proceeded northwesterly for the final 12 seconds, and the altitude descended from 3,000 feet to 2,600 feet, to 2,400 feet, to the accident elevation at 1,253 feet.  Impact forces destroyed the airplane.  According to the airplane's owner, the attitude gyro indicated a 10-degree left angle of bank when the airplane was in level flight.  No preaccident mechanical anomalies were discovered during the investigation.  At the time of the accident the reported weather was 1,400 feet overcast, with tops estimated at 3,000 feet.

After the first missed approach, the controller advised the crew that there was an airport 36 miles to the north with \"much better\" weather, but the crew declined, citing a need to clear customs. During the third missed approach, the left engine lost power, and while the airplane was being vectored for a fourth approach, the right engine lost power. Utilizing the global positioning system, the captain pointed the airplane toward the intersection of the airport's two runways. Approximately 50 feet above the ground, he saw runway lights, and landed. The captain attempted to lower the landing gear prior to the landing, but it would not extend due to a lack of hydraulic pressure from the loss of engine power, and the alternate gear extension would not have been completed in time.

The pilot operated the rental airplane from Pacific Coast Flyers, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, as a business cross-country flight. The pilot and one passenger were fatally injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight had departed from the San Luis County Regional Airport (SBP), San Luis Obispo, California, at an undetermined time. The flight was destined for Mc Clellan-Palomar Airport (CRQ), Carlsbad, California. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight, and no flight plan had been filed. The pilot radioed a mayday call to an air traffic controller at Point Magu Naval Air Station, and indicated that he had oil on his windscreen and smoke in the cockpit. Subsequently radio and radar contact was lost. An Alert Notification (ALNOT) was issued at 2212. The airplane was located the following morning at 0430 in mountainous terrain by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department and a Search and Rescue crew accessed the site, and reported that the airplane came to rest inverted about 300 feet from the top of the ridgeline. The National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Aviation Administration, and Cessna Aircraft responded to the site. The airplane had impacted the mountain about 50 feet above its final resting spot. Oil was observed from the nose of the airplane to the tail cone.A further inspection of the airplane will take place following its recovery.",

The helicopter was operated by Brim Aviation, and the ship pilot was a member of the Columbia Bar Pilot's Association. Neither the helicopter nor the ship was damaged, and none of the three helicopter crewmembers were injured. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133. Light rain and night meteorological conditions prevailed, and no FAA flight plan was filed for the flight. The helicopter crew consisted of three persons; the pilot, the co-pilot, and the hoist operator. According to the crewmembers, they intercepted the ship when it was in the Pacific Ocean, about 15 miles from the mouth of the Columbia River, with the mission to deliver the ship pilot onto the ship while the ship was underway. When the helicopter arrived at the ship, the crew spent several minutes attempting to determine a suitable location to deposit the ship pilot. They eventually agreed that a small open area near the starboard bow would be used. When the helicopter was established in a stationary position relative to the ship for the lowering, the helicopter pilot could only see a small portion of the ship for his reference and station-keeping. Just as the ship pilot touched down on the deck of the ship, the helicopter pilot lost visual reference with the ship, and the helicopter began \"drifting\" aft relative to the ship. The hoist operator could not pay out cable fast enough to prevent pulling the ship pilot off the deck and then aft. The hoist operator lost sight of the ship pilot, and in response, he sheared the hoist cable. The ship captain fell a few feet to the ship. He recovered from the fall, and successfully piloted the ship thorough the Columbia River mouth to its destination. Upon disembarkation, he went directly to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a fractured scapula. The helicopter pilot had about 5,655 total hours of helicopter flight experience, including about 555 in the subject helicopter make and model, and 396 hours at night. The helicopter co-pilot had about 7,115 total hours of helicopter flight experience, including about 593 hours at night. The hoist operator was a former US Coast Guard hoist operator. In his written statement regarding the event, the ship pilot \"credit[ed] the experience and professionalism of the hoist operator\" in preventing a more serious and adverse outcome. According to a report provided by representatives of the ship pilot, the ship was German-registered, and measured about 730 feet long by 100 feet wide. At the time of the event, the ship was on a heading of 150 degrees, at a speed of 17 knots. According to the operator and representatives of the ship pilot, visibility was about 10 miles, under an overcast of unspecified height. Rain was falling, and the wind was from the south-southwest at a speed of about 15 knots, which resulted in a wind on the starboard bow of the ship. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) information indicated that the helicopter was manufactured in 2011, and was equipped with two Pratt & Whitney 207C series turboshaft engines.",

The purpose of the flight was to conduct touch-and-go takeoffs and landings.  No anomalies were noted with the first portion of the flight.  After departure from a local area airport, the student pilot obtained weather information for another local area airport, as well as the accident airport.  The other airport, about 20 miles northwest of the accident airport, reported weather conditions as IMC.  The accident airport was reporting 7 miles visibility, with no mention of any weather; however, he could see the rotating beacon operating.  He requested clearance to land, and was informed that the airport had just gone to IFR operations due to a fog bank that had moved in.

About the time the flaps reached their maximum extension, the right flap experienced an instantaneous retraction, and the airplane simultaneously rolled about 80 degrees to the right. The pilot countered with almost full left aileron control input for the remainder of the flight. He began troubleshooting steps, but was unable to extend the right flap or retract the left flap. He diverted to another airport and, for the remaining 35 minutes of flight, employed the assistance of a passenger to help with maintaining left aileron control deflection. The landing was made without further incident.Postincident examination of the flap control system revealed that the right wing flap extend cable had failed in the area where it made contact with the inboard flap pulley, an area where the cable had experienced multiple bending cycles throughout its life. The failed cable strands exhibited fatigue signatures, and similar frays and failures were observed in the area of the outboard pulley. The corresponding left flap cable also exhibited similar strand failure features in the inboard and outboard pulley contact areas. The cables were installed when the airplane was manufactured, 36 years prior to the incident. Over this period, the airplane had accumulated 4,832.1 total flight hours.The flap cable was not life limited, and the airplane manufacturer's maintenance manual did not require the removal of flight control cables during inspection. The mechanic who performed the most recent inspection reported that he examined the cables utilizing the methods prescribed in the manufacturer's service manual but did not detect any damage. He further stated that the damage was only obvious once the cables had been removed and subsequently flexed and looped by hand.A review of Federal Aviation Administration Service Difficulty Reports for the airplane series revealed 33 instances of similar flap cable wear or failure on 25 separate airplanes. About half of the reports indicated flap cable failures occurring during flight; all were during the critical landing approach phase. The failures resulted in asymmetric flap deployment, and some resulted in a violent departure from controlled flight. In a few instances, the damage caused by the cable separation prevented the retraction of the remaining extended flap, and, therefore, the pilot had to maintain very high opposing aileron control inputs in order to control and land the airplane. A common finding noted in the reports was that the cable damage could not be readily observed unless the cables were removed.A service bulletin is in development by the airplane manufacturer concerning the inspection procedures and replacement criteria for the flap cables in the airplane series.",
