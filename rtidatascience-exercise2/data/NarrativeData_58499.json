About 7 minutes later, the pilot asked the controller if he knew what the \"ceiling\" of the clouds was, and about 4 minutes after that asked the controller for a radar vector.  When queried about the request, the pilot responded, \"we're kinda lost in some fog here.\"  The controller then asked the pilot to state his present heading, to which the pilot replied, \"I can't tell, I think we're upside-down.\"  The controller instructed the pilot to turn right, and several seconds later advised the pilot to stop the turn.  During this time the airplane had completed a left turn, and its altitude varied between 4,500 and 4,700 feet.  The pilot then stated, \"we can't see, we can't see, we can't see.\"  Witnesses reported hearing a loud sound, and then saw the wings of the airplane descend to the ground detached from the fuselage.  Examination of both wings revealed signatures consistent with an in-flight separation in the positive, or upward, direction.  All of the fracture surfaces examined on both wings, and their respective wing struts, were consistent with overload.  No evidence of any pre-separation failures or malfunctions were noted.  The pilot did not contact any flight service stations or use DUATS to obtain a weather briefing prior to the accident flight; however, a relative of the pilot stated that the pilot had checked the weather and found that it \"looked ok above 2,500 [feet].\"  The weather conditions reported in the vicinity of the accident site included low clouds and visibility in light to heavy rain.

During the landing roll, the pilot applied the brakes to avoid colliding with an irrigation pipe, and the airplane nosed over and came to rest in the inverted position.  Examination of the propeller, by an FAA inspector, revealed that it appeared to be damaged due to a wire strike.  However, there were no broken high wires found in the immediate area of the accident site, and the pilot did not recall striking any wires.

Approximately 13 minutes after departure, the 1,027-hour pilot, sole occupant, reported the airplane was accumulating ice, requested and was cleared to descend the airplane from 5,000 to 4,000 feet msl.  Subsequently, the pilot requested and was cleared to descend to 3,000 feet, and proceed direct to the initial approach fix for the RNAV(GPS) 36 non-precision approach for landing at an alternate airport.  No distress call or additional ATC communications with the pilot were recorded.  The airplane impacted trees and terrain approximately 17 nautical miles south of the airport.  Tree deformation, ground scars, and craters, were consistent with a near vertical impact.  The NTSB meteorological study revealed that instrument meteorological conditions with low ceilings, reduced visibility, light rain, mist, and drizzle prevailed  at the departure airport and along the flight route.  The low-level vertical temperature profile in the accident area was likely the following;  1 degree Celsius at the surface, minus 3 degrees at 3,000 feet, freezing level at 5,000 feet, and above freezing at 7,000-8,000 feet.  SLD was  likely present in the accident area at and below 5,00 feet and produced moderate to severe clear icing on the airframe in the minutes prior to the accident.  The investigation revealed the airplane was equipped with alcohol propellers; however, the impact and thermal destruction precluded a determination of the operational status of the anti-ice system.   Both propellers exhibited physical evidence (blade bending and twisting) consistent with high power ( at or near the low pitch range)  and rotation (symmetrical energy) at impact.   No evidence of an in-flight mechanical or flight control malfunction was found that would have rendered the airplane uncontrollable prior to the impact.  GPS was not approved for IFR.  After the accident, the RNAV(GPS) 36 approach was flight checked by the FAA, and all components were found to be operating within prescribed tolerances. ",

The pilot attempted to land in a field, but noticed a large number of cattle in the way. He then landed the aircraft early in soft soil, where the nose gear collapsed. An examination revealed that a fuel line quick disconnect fitting had come loose in the line between the fuel selector and the fuel pump. The fitting allowed access to a fuel filter, which required inspection during each 100-hour/annual inspection. According to the aircraft maintenance records, the line was last removed and reinstalled about 20 hours before the accident. An examining FAA inspector reported that the quick disconnect fitting was safety-wired in accordance with the maintenance instructions. The inspector further stated that even with the safety wire in place 'I was able to insert, lock, unlock and remove the coupler from the pump.'  No fuel stains were noted in the area of the fuel pump. ",
            "probable_cause": "a disconnect of a fuel line fitting, due to the manufacturer's inadequate design and/or lack of adequate installation procedure for replacement of the fuel filter; which resulted in fuel starvation, loss of engine power, and a forced landing.  Soft terrain in the emergency landing area was a related factor. "

The pilot accepted a midfield intersection departure from the 6,995-foot-long runway. At about the time the airplane rotated for takeoff, the engine started to make the popping noise again. At about 75 feet above the ground, the engine quit running. The airplane had flown past the departure end of the runway, and the pilot attempted to return to the airport. However, the airplane crash landed in a sugar cane field before reaching the runway. The last previous annual inspection had been completed on 2/14/93. In November 1995, an A&P; mechanic made another inspection. The mechanic indicated the airplane was in need of work and the engine had low compression. He did not return the airplane to service and released it back to the pilot/previous owner. The pilot told the mechanic he would complete the repairs himself. Examination of the left magneto revealed the internal 'P' lead was detached from its connector; and the left magneto's internal mechanism was dirty, contaminated with engine oil, and displayed evidence of internal electrical arcing. According to the engine manufacturer, this could account for the popping noise. No record was found that the pilot possessed a current airman medical certificate or biennial flight review. ",

The pilot switched fuel tanks and achieved a restart and then continued to his destination. Approaching the destination, the aircraft developed a moderate vibration which subsided with the reduction and re-application of throttle. The pilot executed a normal approach but was high and initiated a go-around. During the left crosswind turn, the engine abruptly quit for a second time, and the pilot executed a forced landing. During the landing roll, the aircraft's main landing gear folded and collapsed.  Post-accident examination of the aircraft revealed 3.5 gallons of fuel remaining in the left wing and 1.5 gallons of fuel remaining in the right wing.  The pilot stated that he had departed with full fuel tanks on this flight, which was his first long-distance flight in the experimental airplane. The aircraft's records indicated that its fuel capacity was 60 gallons, of which 56 gallons were considered usable fuel; however the actual fuel capacity and unusable fuel were not verified after the accident. The pilot stated that the aircraft did not have a flight manual, so he based his estimates of 10 gallons per hour fuel burn rate and 130 knots cruise speed at high altitude as a conservative interpretation of the information that had been given to him by the airplane's previous owner (8 to 9 gallons per hour, and 140 knots cruise speed).  The pilot flight-planned for an estimated flight time of three hours, and estimated that he would have consumed about half of the fuel carried in the airplane.  While en route, he determined that his true airspeed and ground speed were about 103 knots; less than what he had been told by the airplane's previous owner.

The flightcrew performed a low approach and ground personnel stated that the nose gear doors were partially open.  The flightcrew subsequently performed an emergency landing, with the nose landing gear retracted.  After the airplane came to a stop, the passengers deplaned via the aft door exit.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the nose landing gear spray deflector was fractured near the middle, and found in two sections.  The right section of the spray deflector had rotated about 180 degrees, and was found wedged between the nose landing gear and the right side of the wheel-well structure.  The nose landing gear tire was above the wedged spray deflector section.  The left section of the spray deflector was found in it's original position, which was forward, with the nose landing gear retracted.  There was evidence of yellow paint transfer on the right upper surface (aft corner) of the spray deflector.  Similar paint marks were observed on the left bottom surface (forward corner) of the spray deflector section.  In addition, yellow paints chips were found embedded under a screw head at that location.  The distance between the two yellow paint marks was approximately 29 inches.  The tow operator who participated in the pushback of the airplane prior to takeoff stated that the tow bar became disconnected while the airplane was being towed; however, he did not observe any damage to the airplane.  The tow bar was painted yellow and the distance between the tow bar forks was approximately 30 inches.",
            "probable_cause": "A fractured nose gear spray deflector due to contact with a tow bar during pushback, which subsequently jammed and prevented nose gear extension during landing.  A factor in this accident was the tow operator's failure to detect the damaged spray deflector."

Each flight was approximately 30 minutes in duration. The airplane was refueled after approximately every other flight with about 12 gallons of fuel. Prior to takeoff for the tenth and final flight of the day, the pilot thought he had about 16 gallons of fuel in the airplane; however, he did not visually confirm how much fuel was in the tanks and could not remember what the fuel gauges indicated. The pilot departed and dropped one skydiver at an altitude of 4,000 feet and two more skydivers at 10,000 feet. Upon returning to the airport, he flew an extended downwind leg to maintain separation with another landing airplane. While turning onto final approach, the pilot attempted to increase engine power, but the engine did not respond. He continued toward the runway, and during the descent the airplane struck trees, impacted the ground, and flipped over, substantially damaging the left wing and fuselage.

During his first takeoff attempt, the right wing of his glider contacted the long grass, and it began to veer sharply to the right. At that point, the pilot released from the tow plane, and tried to maintain directional control as the glider came to a stop.  Although he attempted to keep the aircraft aligned with the runway, the aircraft slid off the right side off the runway surface. After inspecting the glider for damage, and finding none, he attempted a second takeoff, which was successful. Upon returning to the airport after soaring for approximately four hours, the pilot elected to land on the same grass runway he had departed from, instead of on the adjacent paved runway. Although the touchdown was successful, at the very beginning of the landing roll, the wing again began contacting the long grass. Although the pilot tried to keep the aircraft tracking straight down the runway, the resistance of the grass pulling on the wing resulted in the aircraft turning sideways and sliding along the runway surface.

The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local airshow demonstration flight that departed about 1220.The flight team manager, who also provided the public-announcement during the accident flight, reported that the accident flight began with the airplane rolling inverted shortly after liftoff, followed by a shallow inverted climb past show-center. The airplane then rolled upright before entering a 90-degree turn away from show-center and the crowd. The airplane continued to climb, while on the opposite heading used for the takeoff, before it turned back to the runway heading and reentered the aerobatic box. The airplane then rolled inverted before it entered a 45-degree dive toward show-center. The airplane then completed several descending aileron rolls before it rolled wings level and entered a near vertical climb. At the apex of the climb/loop, the airplane entered an inverted flat spin.Ground-based video footage showed that the airplane completed 3-1/2 rotations in the inverted flat spin before it entered a near vertical dive. The video footage then showed a momentary increase in airplane pitch, achieving a positive deck angle of about 20-degrees, before the airplane entered a rapid left roll. The airplane then entered a nose-down left descending spiral into terrain.A postaccident examination established that the airplane impacted terrain in a near vertical attitude. Flight control continuity was confirmed from all flight control surfaces to their respective cockpit controls. The engine was located in a 2-1/2 feet deep impact crater and remained partially connected to the firewall. Three engine cylinders had partially separated from the crankcase, which prevented the engine from being rotated. After removing several cylinders, an internal examination did not reveal any mechanical discontinuities within the engine drivetrain. The No. 1 magneto exhibited impact damage that prevented a functional test. The No. 2 magneto provided a spark on all leads when rotated. All three propeller blades exhibited damage consistent with the engine producing power at the time of impact. The postaccident examination of the airplane did not reveal any mechanical anomalies that would have prevented normal operation.

He had exhausted the fuel in the left fuel tank and was operating the airplane on the right fuel tank; he reported that he thought the airplane had about 12 gallons of fuel remaining. After circling the camp twice about 8,000 ft mean sea level,\u00a0the engine lost all power. In an effort to restore engine power, he switched fuel tanks, applied carburetor heat, and pumped the throttle. However, the engine sputtered and then lost total power again. He turned the airplane toward the nearest airstrip and was able to restore intermittent engine power by continuing to pump the throttle and rocking the wings.\u00a0While the pilot was performing an emergency landing, the engine sputtered and had a short burst of power, which resulted in the airplane overshooting the intended landing area and overrunning the departure end of the runway. The airplane nosed over and sustained substantial damage to the rudder and left lift strut. No fuel was found on the ground or vegetation at the accident site. About 8 gallons of fuel was removed from the right fuel tank, and the left fuel tank was empty.\u00a0No preaccident engine anomalies were noted. A review of the airplane\u2019s maintenance records revealed that its original bladder fuel tanks had been replaced with two 24-gallon aluminum-alloy fuel tanks and that this modification was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under its field approval process; this process required that the maintenance information meet the original type certification basis for major alterations to aircraft, engines, and propellers certificated under the Civil Air Regulations. However, no fuel flow tests, usable/unusable fuel quantities, placarding, or flight manual supplement was referenced in the description of work when the tanks were installed or when the alteration was approved by the FAA as was required to meet the original type certification basis for the aircraft. Examination of the wing fuel tanks revealed that the left tank\u2019s internal baffle had half-moon lightening holes at the bottom of the fuel baffle, that the right tank\u2019s internal baffle had lightening holes that started about 1 inch from the bottom of the tank, and that the baffle fit tight against the bottom of the right fuel tank.\u00a0Given the lack of lightening holes at the bottom of the right fuel tank\u2019s internal baffle it is likely that the unusable fuel in the right tank would have been significantly greater than the unusable fuel in the left tank. Each tank had a placard near the filler cap on the exterior of the wing indicating that the tank had 24 gallons of usable fuel. The fuel selector inside the cockpit had a placard indicating 36 gallons. However, postaccident calculations estimated that the total usable fuel was actually 22.5 gallons and that the unusable fuel was about 4 to 5 gallons per fuel tank. Due to maintenance personnel\u2019s failure to conduct the required fuel system tests after the system was modified, the FAA\u2019s improper approval of the fuel tank modification, and the inconsistencies in the construction of the fuel tank baffles and in the fuel-related placarding, the pilot would have had no clear idea of how much usable or unusable fuel was available in each wing tank. Given the lack of mechanical deficiencies with the engine, it is likely that the engine lost power due to fuel starvation. ",

A company airline transport certificated pilot, with an adult and two teen-aged passengers, departed for a remote airstrip on the first of two planned flights.  The station manager said he was maintaining VFR company flight following procedures.  The pilot was to return and pick up the station manager, and the father of the teens, after the first flight.  When the airplane did not return, the station manager said he did not become concerned, thinking the pilot was waiting for marginal weather conditions to improve.  No radio contact was received from the airplane, and no emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal was received from the airplane.  When the airplane did not return by the afternoon of the following day, the flight was reported overdue by the teens' father. Search personnel then began receiving an ELT signal in the area of the airstrip.  Search aircraft located the airplane at the airstrip on the evening of the second day.  The pilot reported that he was asked by the company station manager to fly the passengers to the airstrip.

While enroute, the engine lost power and the pilot was unable to restart the engine. He then performed a forced landing in a field, during which both wings sustained substantial damage.After the accident, about 35 gallons of fuel remained in the left wing and 5 gallons remained in the right wing. Postaccident examination indicated that the left forward wing fuel line was partially blocked; the aft left and both right wing fuel lines were free of obstruction. Additionally, the fuel control unit was contaminated with debris. All other fuel system parts were free of obstructions. The left forward fuel line and fuel fitting were sent to the NTSB materials laboratory for examination and were found to be blocked with debris consistent with soil. The debris in the left forward wing fuel line alone would not have reduced fuel flow to the engine; however, the contamination of the fuel control unit likely would have reduced fuel flow sufficient to cause fuel starvation.

At 0725:00, the DEN ground controller instructed LYM4216 to taxi to runway 34 via taxiways M and AA.  According the SW4 pilot, blowing snow reduced his visibility and taxiway SC was covered with snow that prevented him from seeing the centerline lighting.

The pilot advised he was abeam Signature.  Once the controller asked his location, the pilot stated that he noticed that he was on a runway.The First Officer of FFT297 reported, \"the Captain and I were flying back to Denver from St. Louis.  The weather had deteriorated in Denver so we prepared to fly a full instrument approach.  We were cleared to land on runway 35L by tower.  I believe we broke out of the clouds around 600 feet.

The flight instructor in the Piper reported that at an altitude of about 7,500 feet mean sea level (msl), he told the pilot receiving instruction to conduct a simulated emergency descent. The instructor stated that the pilot receiving instruction executed the simulated emergency descent and recovered to cruise flight at an altitude of about 4,500 feet msl before they continued toward a local airport. As the flight continued, the instructor observed a single-engine airplane that appeared to be on a converging course, and he transmitted a position report on the intended destination airport's common traffic advisory frequency. The instructor stated that after making a slight heading change and descent, he re-established visual contact with a single-engine airplane, which was then behind and above the Piper\u2019s position. He then scanned the area ahead of the Piper\u2019s position from left to right. The instructor said he then felt a jolt along with a violent shudder in the airplane followed by an uncommanded left roll and yaw. The instructor took control of the airplane and made a forced landing to a nearby open field. Review of recorded radar data revealed that the Piper was on a northwesterly heading at 7,700 feet msl when it initiated a right descending turn. Meanwhile, the Beech was traveling on a continuous northeasterly heading at an altitude of about 2,400 feet msl. The last recorded radar target for each airplane before the collision showed that the airplanes were on converging paths; the Piper was at 2,800 feet msl on a northeasterly heading and maneuvering west of the Beech, which was at an altitude of about 2,400 feet msl on a north-northeasterly heading. During examination of the recovered wreckage, transfer marks were identified consistent with the radar-derived collision angle. Both airplanes were operating in visual conditions when they collided.Based on relative positions of the airplanes, and given the other airplane traffic in the area, it seems likely that the single-engine airplane the Piper instructor observed before the collision was not the Beech with which the collision occurred. It could not be determined if either pilot could see the other just before the collision; however, based on the airplanes\u2019 relative positions and flight attitudes, it seems unlikely. The Piper was maneuvering in a left bank at the time and it is likely that the Piper\u2019s wing and engine blocked the Beech from the Piper pilot's field of vision. Additionally, the Beech pilot\u2019s view of the Piper, which was above and to the left of his flight path, would likely have been blocked by the airplane\u2019s door post and cabin roof structure.",

Review of the maintenance records revealed that on October 30, 1998, the maintenance facility had removed the tail rotor hub and blade assembly from the accident aircraft, and replaced it with the tail rotor hub and blade assembly from a Bell 206L-1.  This was the first flight since the replacement.  The Director of Maintenance reported that the maintenance technician did not perform a rigging check after installing the new assembly because he assumed that the same assembly did not require a check.  According to the maintenance records, the tail rotor pitch links that were installed on the accident aircraft were Part Number 206-010-795-101.  The maintenance manual states that the pitch links for a Bell 206L-3 should be Part Number 206-010-795-105.  According to a representative from Bell Helicopter Textron, all the parts from the tail rotor hub and blade assembly are compatible from the Bell 206L-1 to the Bell 206L-3, except for the tail rotor pitch links.  He further stated that the tail rotor pitch links on the Bell 206L-1 are smaller than those from the Bell 206L-3, and would give the pilot less tail rotor authority. ",
            "probable_cause": "The loss of tail rotor effectiveness, due to the installation of incorrect pitch links by the maintenance facility.  A factor in the accident was the lack of an adequate quality assurance program in the maintenance facility. "

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The instrument-rated pilot activated the autopilot shortly after takeoff and proceeded in a west-northwesterly direction while climbing to the assigned altitude of flight level (FL) 260. Light-to-moderate icing conditions were forecast for the area; the forecast conditions were well within the airplane's capability, and the pilot of a nearby airplane reported only encountering light rime ice at the top of FL260. About 26 minutes 35 seconds after takeoff, the airplane's central advisory and warning system (CAWS) recorded activation of Pusher Ice Mode at FL247, consistent with pilot's activation of the propeller de-ice and inertial separator; the de-ice boots were not selected. Less than a minute after the activation of Pusher Ice Mode, an air traffic controller cleared the flight to deviate right of course due to adverse weather well ahead of the airplane. The airplane then turned right while on autopilot in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) at FL251; about 4 seconds into the turn, with the airplane indicating about 109 knots indicated airspeed and in a right bank of less than 25 degrees, the autopilot disconnected for undetermined reasons. The pilot allowed the bank angle to increase, and about 13 seconds after the autopilot disconnected, and with the airplane descending in a right bank of about 50 degrees, the pilot began a test of the autopilot system, which subsequently passed. Recovered data and subsequent analysis indicate that the pilot allowed the bank angle to increase to a minimum of 75 degrees while descending; the maximum airspeed reached 338 knots. During the right descending turn, while about 15,511 feet and 338 knots (about 175 knots above maximum operating maneuvering speed), the pilot likely applied either abrupt or full aft elevator control input, resulting in overstress fracture of both wings in a positive direction. The separated section of right wing impacted and breached the fuselage, causing one passenger to be ejected from the airplane. Following the in-flight break-up, the airplane descended uncontrolled into an open field. Examination of the separated structural components revealed no evidence of pre-existing cracks on any of the fracture surfaces. Postaccident examination of the primary flight controls and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. The flaps were found in the retracted position, and the landing gear was extended; it is likely that the pilot extended the landing gear during the descent. The horizontal stabilizer trim actuator was positioned in the green arc takeoff range, the impact-damaged aileron trim actuator was in the left-wing-nearly-full-down position, and the rudder trim actuator was full nose right. The as-found positions of the aileron, rudder trim, and landing gear were not the expected positions for cruise climb. Examination of the relays, trim switch, and rudder trim circuit revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction, and examination of the aileron trim relays and aileron trim circuit revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction; therefore, the reason for the as-found positions of the rudder and aileron trim could not be determined. Impact-related discrepancies with the autopilot flight computer precluded functional testing. The trim adapter passed all acceptance tests with the exception of the aural alert output, which would not have affected its proper operation. The CAWS log entries indicated no airframe or engine systems warnings or cautions before the airplane departed from controlled flight. A radar performance study indicated that the airplane did not enter an aerodynamic stall, and according to the CAWS log entries, there was no record that the stick pusher activated before the departure from controlled flight.Before purchasing the airplane about 5 weeks earlier, the pilot had not logged any time as pilot-in-command in a turbopropeller-equipped airplane and had not logged any actual instrument flight time in the previous 7 years 4 months. Additionally, his last logged simulated instrument before he purchased the airplane occurred 4 years 7 months earlier. Subsequent to the airplane purchase, he attended ground and simulator-based training that included extra flight sessions in the accident airplane, likely due to his inexperience. The training culminated with the pilot receiving his instrument proficiency check, flight review, and high-altitude endorsements; after the training, he subsequently logged about 14 hours as pilot-in-command of the accident airplane. Although the pilot likely met the minimum qualification standards to act as pilot-in-command by federal aviation regulations, his lack of experience in the make and model airplane was evidenced by the fact that he did not maintain control of the airplane after the autopilot disengaged. The airplane was operating in instrument conditions, but there was only light rime ice reported and no convective activity nearby; the pilot should have been able to control the airplane after the autopilot disengaged in such conditions. Further, his lack of experience was evident in his test of the autopilot system immediately following the airplane's departure from controlled flight rather than rolling the airplane to a wings-level position, regaining altitude; only after establishing coordinated flight should he have attempted to test the autopilot system.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot to maintain control of the airplane while climbing to cruise altitude in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) following disconnect of the autopilot. The reason for the autopilot disconnect could not be determined during postaccident testing. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's lack of experience in high-performance, turbo-propeller airplanes and in IMC."

The airplane intercepted the initial approach fix, turned onto the runway approach course, and began a normal descent through clouds without incident until it veered to the northeast and radar contact was lost. The airplane impacted the ground about 1 mile north-northwest of the last radar target and 8 miles south of the destination airport. No preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures were found that would have precluded normal operation. Evidence of significant in-flight ice accumulation was observed on the base of a communications antenna mounted on the top of the fuselage and on the upper surface of the inboard two-thirds of the left horizontal stabilizer. At the time of the accident, freezing precipitation, which coated the ground with ice, was present in the vicinity of the accident site.

He informed a mechanic responsible for the airplane, who assured him that the airplane was fine and that the leak could be stopped by knocking a screwdriver against the carburetor. The pilot did as instructed, and the leak stopped. The day before the accident, the pilot asked the mechanic whether any maintenance was conducted on the carburetor, and the mechanic informed him that no maintenance was conducted, because it was not necessary.

The next day, during the cruise portion of the return flight, the engine rpm suddenly decreased below 2,000 rpm. The pilot manipulated the mixture and carburetor heat controls, and verified that the ignition switch and master switches were appropriately set. The rpm continued to decrease, and about 30 seconds after the onset of the rpm drop, the engine stopped producing power. The pilot initiated a forced landing on a road, and the airplane was substantially damaged when the left wing struck a fence post.

The engine was test run on the airplane, at various rpm settings, with no anomalies noted. The carburetor was removed and further examined. When fuel was introduced via the fuel inlet, the carburetor immediately started flooding and leaking from the venturi, which was consistent with an open float valve. Further examination and teardown revealed multiple anomalies, including internal contamination and corrosion, excessive wear, incorrect parts, incorrectly installed parts, and a damaged float assembly. Some of the internal contaminants floated, and some sank in the fuel, which allowed for the possibility that the contaminants could prevent full closure of the float valve.

The pilot contacted air traffic control (ATC) after takeoff and requested visual flight rules (VFR) flight following.   ATC radar data indicated that the flight climbed to 5,500 feet mean sea level (msl) and proceeded on-course toward the intended destination.  About 30 minutes into the flight, ATC informed the accident airplane of traffic in his vicinity.  The other airplane was approximately 3 miles ahead of his position, northeast bound at 5,000 feet msl at that time.  The accident pilot reported he did not have the traffic in sight.  About 2 minutes later, ATC informed the accident pilot that the traffic was about 1-1/2 miles off his right wing.  The pilot was also instructed to contact another ATC facility.  The accident pilot did not respond to either transmission.  The ATC radar track data suggested that the airplane subsequently entered a descending left turn, from a southeast course to a southwest course.  The airplane appeared to level off at 4,900 feet msl momentarily, before it entered a descending right turn.  The final radar data point was at 4,000 feet msl, which was the floor of radar coverage in the area.  The airplane appeared to be in a right turn, passing through a northwest course at that time.  The accident site was located approximately 1/2 mile east of the final radar data point.  The accident site was located in a sparsely populated, rural agricultural area.  The wreckage distribution was consistent with a low-level separation of the horizontal stabilator prior to impact.  The examination also revealed that the right aft wing spars were bent upward and fractured at the wing-to-fuselage splice joint.  All fracture surfaces were consistent with tensile overload failures.  Stabilator and rudder control continuity was confirmed from the control surface to the aft cabin area.  The post accident airframe and engine examination did not reveal any anomalies associated with an in-flight malfunction.",

According to the pilot, he heard a loud \"thunk\" during takeoff climb and noted a loss of engine power.  He manipulated the power lever from the full forward position to the full aft position (\"stop-to-stop\") and noted he had no power.  Post-accident examination of the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A -114A engine revealed that the compressor turbine (CT) vane's outer rim liberated a section of metal that damaged the turbine blades downstream.  The area of liberated material from the CT vane outer rim was examined by the manufacturer's metallurgists.  The fracture surface of the outer rim showed evidence of fatigue with signs of oxidation in some areas indicating the crack had been in existence for some time.  The liberated material impact damaged the CT blades and resulted in a loss of power.  Review of the operator's records revealed that the engine was approved for an extension beyond the normally recommended 3,600-hour overhaul period, to 5,100 hours.  The engine had accumulated 4,461.3 hours at the time of the accident.  In addition, the turbine section (hot section) had a recommended overhaul period of 1,800 hours; however, the operator instead elected to utilize an engine trend monitoring program in accordance with a manufacturer issued service bulletin.  Many errors were noted with the operator's manually recorded data utilized for the trend monitoring.  However, it is not likely that the engine trend data, even had it been correctly recorded and monitored, would have depicted the fatigue cracking in the CT vane outer rim.  As a result, the manufacturer issued a service information letter (SIL) PT6A-116 in January 27, 2003 (following a similar investigation), which reminded operators to conduct borescope inspections of the CT vane during routine fuel nozzle maintenance, as the manufacturer's maintenance manual recommended.  Review of the maintenance record entries for the accident engine revealed no evidence that a borescope inspection had been conducted in conjunction with the fuel nozzle checks.",
            "probable_cause": "The fatigue failure of the compressor turbine stator vane, the liberation of vane material into the compressor turbine, and the total loss of engine power.  Also causal was the operator's failure to inspect the compressor turbine vane during fuel nozzle checks."

Further examination revealed that the Rolls Royce (Allison) manufactured compressor adapter coupling had been installed approximately 1,005 hours earlier and that the separation had been the result of multiple fatigue fractures in the coupling associated with severe fretting on the adapter's outer diameter where it inserts into the spur adapter gearshaft.",

The accident flight was the first flight after the oil filter had been replaced.  The pilot reported that the engine began losing power about two miles south of the departure airport.  He stated that the engine seized during a turn back toward the airport.  He reported that the airplane did not have enough altitude remaining to glide to a runway and that he performed a downwind landing to a nearby road because there was \"no place to go into the wind, even knowing I had a 29 [knot] tailwind.\"  The pilot reported that the airplane impacted a street light and vehicle during the forced landing to a residential area.  The pilot estimated that less than 30-seconds transpired between the loss of engine power and the impact with terrain.  Post accident inspection of the engine revealed that the number four connecting rod had separated and protruded through the top of the engine case.  An oil film covered the oil filter, the accessory case below the oil filter, and the bottom of the fuselage.  The oil system was pressurized and a leak was noted around the base of the oil filter canister.  Further inspection revealed that the oil filter canister bolt was not adequately torqued and its retaining safety-wire was incorrectly installed.  Additionally, the canister base gasket was incorrectly installed which allowed oil to leak out from the canister base.  No leaks were noted after the gasket was repositioned and the canister was reinstalled.  The pilot reported that the oil-pressure was \"in green\" during an engine run-up check completed prior to takeoff.  Several individuals reported there was an approximately 4-foot diameter oil spill in the ramp area used by the accident airplane for start-up and pre-takeoff operations.",
