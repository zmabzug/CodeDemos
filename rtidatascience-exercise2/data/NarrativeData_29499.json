The pilot shut down the affected engine and the fire warning quickly ceased.  No fire bottles were discharged.  The airplane taxied to the gate and the passengers deplaned normally.  The airplane was undamaged and no injuries were reported.  The incident flight was a 14 CFR Part 121 regularly scheduled passenger flight from a Des Moines Airport, Iowa, to ATL.Examination of the engine revealed that the Start Operability Bleed Valve (OBV) fuel return adapter-fitting had fractured and the electrical harness in the vicinity of the OBV was sooted and thermally damaged.  No cowling damage was noted.  Metallurgical examination of the fractured fuel return adapter-fitting revealed that it had failed in fatigue due to cyclic loading.  The return adapter-fitting tube end ball-nose area had a dent.  Material deposits were found outboard of the sealing area and axial scrape marks were found beneath and adjacent to the deposited material.  The valve flow body flange of the OBV also exhibited a dent and material deposit.  An analysis of the deposited material revealed elemental peaks of silicon and oxygen, elements present in sand and not in the return adapter-fitting alloy composition. The presence of silicone and the dent is consistent with the OBV most likely having been dropped and impacted a hard surface that damaged the fuel return adapter-fitting before it was reinstalled on the engine.  The impact damage to the return adapter-fitting reduced its loading-carrying and fatigue capability. The OBV fuel return adapter-fitting eventually fractured and separated, which allowed fuel to spill onto a hot engine case that ignited the undercowl fire. Although not related to the incident, testing and analytical modeling of the OBV adapter-fitting joint revealed that, as designed, the joint is directly affected by variations in the applied preload caused by differences in installation torque, coefficient of friction, application of a primer on the serrations, and use of the combination installation tool and that static applied loads were sufficient to create loose contact between the adapter-fitting and the OBV piston housing threads.  Vibratory loads during normal engine operation can create relative motion between the adapter-fitting and the piston housing threads generating a wear mechanism that can eventually lead to a fatigue separation of the piston housing threads and the pull-out of the adapter-fitting and subsequent fuel leaks that could lead to a fire.  To address this design deficiency, service bulletins were issued to replace the affected OBV with an OBV from alternate manufacturer, and the removal schedule was based on the amount of flight time each OBV had accumulated.  The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating the service bulletins.",

The accident occurred under dark, nighttime, visual meteorological conditions, and after about a 22-minute flight.  Illumination of the moon's visible disk was 19 percent.  No roads or ground structures were in the vicinity to provide ground reference or to illuminate the accident area terrain.  The direct course between the departure and destination airports (71 nm apart) was 180 degrees magnetic.  Recorded radar data indicated that during the last 3 minutes of flight, the airplane's average ground track was 176 degrees, and its average ground speed was 168 knots.  The radar ground track ended near the centerline of the direct course between the departure and destination airports, and about 1/4-mile north of the initial point of impact (IPI).  The wreckage distribution path was 640 feet long on a magnetic bearing of 177 degrees.  An examination of the impact ground scars disclosed that the airplane was in controlled flight in a shallow descent when it collided with the terrain.

According to a friend of the flight instructor, the student arrived at 8NC8 around 1010, after which the pilots performed a preflight briefing, taxied to runway 32, and departed about 1040.Review of preliminary radar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration showed a radar target with a 1200 transponder code near the departure end of runway 32, at a reported altitude of 400 feet, at 1040. The target continued climbing while remaining on a relatively straight track to the northwest. About one minute later, the target leveled at 1,200 feet, as it tracked northwest, maintaining between 1,200 and 1,400 feet over the next three minutes. Between 1044:13 and 1044:22, the airplane climbed from its previously established altitude of 1,400 feet to 1,700 feet, where it remained for approximately 5 seconds.

About three hours after takeoff, the gages indicated that 28 gallons was used.

About nine miles from the destination and 1,000 feet above the ground, the airplane flew through brief moderate turbulence.

One witness noted that the airplane appeared to be lower than the surrounding hills.  Power lines are situated just south of the dam and proceed along the south-side of the river.  The power lines cross the river to its north side at a point where the river makes a \"U\" shaped 180-degree turn, heading north momentarily and then reversing course to the south.  The power lines cross the river in the southward leg of the \"U\" shape.  The terrain in the middle of the \"U\" shape is about 150 feet higher than the river, which would likely block the view of the south flowing leg of the river, and perhaps the power line, from a pilot following the river at low altitude.  The power line's wires were found frayed and damaged in the stretch that crossed the river.  The airplane came to rest in the river near the power line crossing.

On September 26, 2003 engine s/n: 34592 was removed from the accident airplane due to high oil consumption with 1,225 hours of time in service. It was reportedly preserved and stored at the operator's warehouse. The mechanic who reportedly preserved the engine stated he followed the steps in the manual that was provided by the operator. On October 27, 2004 the left engine, s/n: NK510332, which was producing metal  for months, was removed and engine s/n: 34592 was taken out of preservation and installed in the left  position on the accident airplane with a new overhauled propeller assembly. On November 06, 2004, the left engine's, s/n: 34592, propeller governor was replaced due to the left propeller slow to response to power setting. During the post accident engine examination, the engine's main oil screen was observed with deposits of metal flakes and fragments, the oil scavenge pump would not rotate and had deposits of metal fragments internally; the engine was seized and wound not rotate. Catastrophic damage was observed to the accessories drive gears, oil transfer tube, and protection covers in the front accessory area. It was observed during a visual inspection of the crankshaft and bearings, including the front journal and front crankpin had damaged and sections of their respective bearings missing. The master rod bearing had incurred a catastrophic failure. Several cylinders skirts were found with impact marks from piston rods. Before removing the propeller assembly from the engine, the propeller feather system was flush with fresh oil and pressured with a feathering pump; the propeller blades were observed moving toward the feather position. Examination of the propeller assembly revealed metal contamination throughout the system; the propeller's governor screen gasket was clogged with metal contamination. The maintenance manual provided by the operator used for the engine preservation details several tasks required to be accomplished to the engine for proper engine preservation (i.e. thrust bear, cylinder, and propeller shaft treatments), which the mechanic did not mention he performed. No documentation for inspection and condition status of the dehydrator plugs were available. Documentation for flushing of contamination from the metal producing engine, s/n NK510332, was not available nor knowledge by the operator if since a process was preformed to the left engine's oil tank and its system before installation of engine s/n: 34592.

Convective SIGMETs for an area of thunderstorms with tops to flight level 410 were in effect at the time and location of the accident.  The FDR data showed aircraft disturbances in vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, altitude, magnetic heading, and vertical speed.  The autopilot and auto-throttle parameters remained engaged throughout the event.  The captain side stick pitch, first officer side stick pitch, and first officer side stick roll parameters showed no movement during the disturbance.  The captain side stick roll parameter moved -1 degree during 2057:07 and then returned to 0 degrees.  The rudder pedal position and rudder parameters showed less than one degree of movement during the event sequence, and the pitch and elevator parameters registered excursions of less than 1.5 degrees.

At that time he chose to fly north, up the valley, in hopes of finding a break in the weather. After about 40 minutes, he was unable to continue due to low fuel, and decided to land in a farm pasture. Upon landing, he discovered the grass to be much taller than anticipated.

The pilot made a forced landing in the airport parking lot, and the airplane collided with a perimeter fence, resulting in structural wing damage. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that neither of the main fuel tanks contained usable fuel. The right tip tank contained about 7.5 gallons of fuel; however, the fuel selector was placarded with a note stating that the tip tanks were for use in level flight only. With the left main tank selected and no fuel in that tank, air would have been introduced into the fuel system, resulting in fuel starvation. The pilot\u2019s preflight planning indicated an en route time of 2 hours 32 minutes. However, when the loss of power occurred, the flight had been airborne for about 3 hours 39 minutes.

The weather conditions included multiple cloud layers from 4,000 to 13,000 feet, with a freezing level around 7,000 feet msl.  An AIRMET was in effect for occasional moderate rime to mixed icing-in-clouds and in-precipitation below 18,000 feet.  As the airplane began to intercept a victor airway, climbing at about 2,000 feet per minute (fpm), and passing through 6,700 feet, the airplane began a series of heading and altitude changes that were not consistent with its ATC clearances.  The airplane turned right and climbed to 8,600 feet, then turned left and descended to 8,000 feet.  The airplane then turned right and climbed to 8,500 feet, where it began a rapidly descending right turn.  At 1034:33, as the aircraft was descending through 7,000 feet, the pilot advised ATC \"four Juliet victor I just lost my needle give me...\"  No further transmissions were received from the accident airplane and the last radar return showed it descending through 3,200 feet at about 11,000 fpm.  Analysis of radar data shows the airplane was close to Vmo at the last Mode C return.  Ground witnesses saw the airplane come out of the clouds in a high speed spiral descent just before it broke up about 1,000 feet agl.  Examination of the wreckage showed that all structural failures were the result of overload.  The aircraft was equipped with full flight instruments on both the left and right sides of the cockpit; however, the flight director system attitude director indicator and horizontal situation indicator were only on the left side.  The aircraft was also equipped for flight into known icing conditions, with in part, heated pitot tubes (left and right sides), static sources, and stall warning vanes.  During the on-scene cockpit examination, except for the pitot heat switches, the cockpit controls and switches were found to be configured in positions consistent with the aircraft's phase of flight prior to the in-flight upset.  The right pitot heat switch was found in the ON position, while the left switch was in the OFF position.  The left pitot heat switch toggle lever was noticeably displaced to the left by impact with an object in the cockpit.  With the exception of the left pitot heat, the anit-ice and deice system switches were all configured for flight in icing conditions.  The pitot heat switches, noted to be of the circuit breaker type (functions as both a toggle switch and circuit breaker), were removed from the panel and sent to a laboratory for examination and testing.  Low power stereoscopic examination of the switches found that the right switch was intact, while the toggle lever mechanism of the left switch was broken loose from the housing.   Microscopic examination of the left switches housing fracture surface revealed imbedded debris and wear marks indicative of an old fracture predating the accident.  The broken left switch could be electrically switched by physically holding the toggle lever mechanism in the appropriate ON or OFF position.  The electrical contact resistance measurements of the left switch varied between 0.3 and 1.4 ohms, and was noted to be intermittently open with the switch in the ON position.  Both switches were then disassembled.  While particulate debris was found in both switches, the left one had a significant amount of large coarse fibrous lint-like debris.  The flexible copper conductor of the left switches circuit breaker section had several broken strands, and the electrical contacts were dirty.  The laboratory report concluded that the left switches toggle was bent to the left in the impact sequence; however, the housing fracture predated the accident and allowed an internal build-up of large coarse fibrous lint-like debris.  The combined effects of the broken housing, the resulting misalignment of the toggle mechanism, the dirty contacts, and the large coarse lint debris prevented reliable electrical switching of the device and presented the opportunity for intermittently open electrical contacts.  Continuity of the plumbing from the pitot tubes and static ports to their respective instruments was verified.  Electrical continuity was established from the bus power sources through the circuit breakers and switches to the heating elements of the pitot tubes and static sources.  The heating elements were connected to a 12-volt battery and the operation of the heating elements verified.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's loss of control and resulting exceedence of the design stress limits of the aircraft, which led to an in-flight structural failure.  The pilot's loss of control was due in part to the loss of primary airspeed reference resulting from pitot tube icing, which was caused by the internal failure of the pitot heat switch.  Factors in the accident were the pilot's distraction caused by the airspeed reading anomaly and spatial disorientation."

The flight crew declared an emergency (the first officer was the pilot flying) and returned to MIA. Post accident examination of the airplane revealed fatigue cracking of the upper fuselage skin above the forward left passenger (L1) door. The fatigue cracking penetrated the fuselage skin, leading to a rupture and an approximate 18-inch-by-7-inch hole that depressurized the airplane.NTSB examinations of a section of the fuselage crown skin (from body station 374 to body station 439) where the rupture occurred revealed fatigue cracking along the lower longitudinal step of the chemically milled pocket just above the stringer S-4L (left) lap joint. The fatigue cracking initiated on the interior surface of the skin at multiple locations and propagated through the skin thickness. The skin thickness at the base of the chemically milled step measured 0.035 to 0.037 inch\u2014which is less than the 0.039-inch minimum thickness specified by Boeing. Calculations from an NTSB study of the fatigue striation density and propagation in the fatigue region indicate that it would take an average of 3,709 total cycles for a crack to grow through skin with 0.035-inch thickness and an average interval of 917 cycles for a crack to grow from a minimally detectable size and penetrate a 0.035-inch skin thickness.The area of cracking and rupture on the accident airplane was not subject to any specific inspections, service bulletins (SB), or airworthiness directives (AD) at the time of the accident. Following the accident, on November 22, 2010, Boeing issued SB 757-53-0097, which called for repetitive external inspections (every 30, 200 cycles, or 300 hours depending on the inspection method) to detect cracks in the fuselage skin along the chemically milled step at stringers S-4L (left) and S 4R (right) between body station 297 and body station 439. On January 10, 2011, the Federal Aviation Administration issued AD 2011-01-15 (effective January 25, 2011) mandating the inspections recommended in SB 757-53-0097.During its investigation, the NTSB learned of a United Airlines 757 and a second American Airlines 757 that exhibited cracking in the fuselage skin similar to the accident airplane;  both had nonconforming thickness at the base of the chemically milled step at the stringer location specified in the SB.

During the flight, the pilot contacted DuPage Airport\u2019s (DPA) air traffic control (ATC) facility, reported the helicopter's position and altitude of 1,400 feet above mean sea level (about 700 feet above ground level in Aurora, Illinois) to the air traffic controller, and asked permission to pass through the airspace surrounding the airport. The controller acknowledged the transmission and cleared the helicopter through DPA\u2019s airspace but did not give the pilot specific instructions regarding his flight route because the pilot was flying under visual flight rules and had chosen his specific route of flight on a direct course from the departure point to the destination. (During preflight planning, the pilot should have identified the obstacles along the route of flight, including the radio station tower.) Subsequently, the helicopter struck a radio station tower while flying at the same altitude that had been reported to ATC. Video and still image evidence obtained during the investigation indicated that the strobe lights attached to the radio station tower were operational at the time of the accident.The accident helicopter was not equipped with a terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). TAWS detects terrain or other obstructions along the flightpath and provides pilots with an alert to take corrective action. On February 7, 2006, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued Safety Recommendation A-06-15, which asked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require EMS operators to install terrain awareness and warning systems on their aircraft and to provide adequate training to ensure that flight crews are capable of using the systems to safely conduct EMS operations. The FAA responded that, while it would work with industry to address issues related to the installation of TAWS on EMS aircraft, it would address the issue of controlled flight into terrain by emphasizing effective preflight planning. The FAA further stated that the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics established a committee tasked with developing helicopter TAWS (H-TAWS) standards and that, in March 2008, the commission completed the development of minimum operational performance standards for H-TAWS. On December 17, 2008, the FAA published Technical Standard Order C194, \u201cHelicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning System,\u201d based on the commission standards. On January 23, 2009, the NTSB indicated that the continuing delays in development of a final rule to require H-TAWS were not acceptable. Pending issuance of a final rule to mandate the installation and use of TAWS on all EMS flights, Safety Recommendation A-06-15 was classified \u201cOpen\u2014Unacceptable Response.\u201d On November 4, 2009, the FAA responded by indicating that it was developing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to address this recommendation and that it planned to complete work on the NPRM in January 2010; the NPRM had not been issued as of March 2010. On November 13, 2009, the NTSB reiterated Safety Recommendation A-06-15 in its report regarding the September 27, 2008, accident involving an Aerospatiale SA365N1, N92MD, operated by the Maryland State Police, which crashed during approach to landing near District Heights, Maryland. Safety Recommendation A-06-15 is on the NTSB\u2019s Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements.The radio station tower was depicted on the Chicago Aeronautical Sectional Chart, the Chicago Visual Flight Rules Terminal Area Chart, the Chicago Helicopter Route Chart, and as an obstruction on the air traffic controller\u2019s radar display. Radar data obtained during the investigation showed the helicopter at a constant altitude and on a straight course to the point of impact with the tower. The radar information was available to the air traffic controller. Additionally, the position and height of the tower were included in training materials that were to be memorized by the controllers at the ATC facility. According to interviews conducted of the controller on duty at the time of the accident, the accident helicopter was the only aircraft traffic in the area at the time. The controller reported that he was attending to administrative duties at the time that the accident occurred. FAA Order 7110.65, \u201cAir Traffic Control,\u201d paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority, states that issuance of safety alerts to aircraft takes first priority over other duties. Further, FAA Order 7110.65, paragraph 2 1-6, Safety Alert, states that controllers should issue a safety alert to an aircraft if they are aware that the aircraft is at an altitude that places it in an unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft and notes that \u201cwhile a controller cannot see immediately the development of every situation where a safety alert must be issued, the controller must remain vigilant for such situations and issue a safety alert when the situation is recognized.\u201d Evidence such as the controller\u2019s failure to notice when the helicopter disappeared from the radar display after striking the antenna indicates that the controller was not monitoring the aircraft\u2019s progress sufficiently to watch for hazards and issue safety alerts as required. While the NTSB recognizes that it was the pilot\u2019s responsibility to \u201csee and avoid\u201d the radio tower, the controller also had a responsibility to issue an alert as required by FAA directives. Review of recorded communications showed that no warnings were issued to the pilot before the accident. In addition, on August 28, 2007, as a result of an accident involving a Bombardier CL 600-2B19, N431CA, that crashed during takeoff from Blue Grass Airport, Lexington, Kentucky, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-07-48, which asked the FAA to revise Federal Aviation Administration Order 7110.65, \u201cAir Traffic Control,\u201d to indicate that controllers should refrain from performing administrative tasks when moving aircraft are in the controller\u2019s area of responsibility. The FAA responded that it would convene an internal work group to review the safety issues identified in this recommendation as they relate to ATC responsibilities and the impact of reassigning those duties to another position. This recommendation was classified \u201cOpen\u2014Acceptable Response\u201d on August 22, 2008. On April 10, 2007, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-07-34 also as a result of the Lexington, Kentucky, accident, which asked the FAA to require all air traffic controllers to complete instructor-led initial and recurrent training in resource management skills that will improve controller judgment, vigilance, and safety awareness. The FAA responded that it had delivered crew resource management workshops, posters, and follow-up support to some larger ATC facilities. The NTSB responded that it was encouraged by the FAA\u2019s actions but that such training should also be provided at smaller ATC facilities. This recommendation was classified \u201cOpen\u2014Acceptable Response\u201d on August 28, 2007. On January 15, 2009, the FAA responded that it was conducting training for controllers at larger facilities but did not indicate how it would perform training at smaller facilities.Vice Chairman Hart did not approve this brief and filed a dissenting statement.

The outside temperature was below freezing, and a steady light to moderate snow was falling.  The airplane sat in the aforementioned ambient conditions for at least 45 minutes before the initiation of the takeoff roll. Prior to attempting the takeoff, the pilot did not remove the accumulated snow or the snow that had melted on the warm airframe and then refroze as ice. The surviving passengers said that the takeoff ground run was longer than normal and the airplane lifted off at 100 knots indicated and momentarily touched back down, and then lifted off again. Almost immediately after it lifted off the second time, the airplane rolled into a steep right bank severe enough that the surviving passengers thought that the wing tip might contact the ground. As the pilot continued the takeoff initial climb, the airplane repeatedly rolled rapidly to a steep left and right bank angle several times and did not seem to be climbing. The airplane was also shuddering, and to the passengers it felt like it may have stalled or dropped. The pilot then lowered the nose and appeared to attain level flight.

Controllers continued to track the airplane as it flew toward the stated destination airport and then turned toward the airport adjacent to the accident site. The airplane arrived in the vicinity of the airport nearly 1 hour after the end of civil twilight and began maneuvering in the vicinity of the approach end of one of the runways. After performing two 180-degree turns, the airplane entered a steep, descending right turn toward the runway's final approach course. The airplane impacted trees about 1/2 mile from the runway threshold, and the wreckage path roughly aligned with the runway's final approach course. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures. The airplane's audio panel microphone selector was found set to a position that would not have allowed the pilot to communicate with controllers or to activate the airport's pilot-controlled runway lighting. A pilot who flew into the airport later that night described that area as a very disorienting \"black hole\" due to the lack of ground lighting at night.The maneuvering observed as the airplane arrived in the vicinity of the airport suggested that the pilot may have been attempting to activate the airport's pilot-controlled lighting and locate the runway. The pilot was likely unable to activate the lighting due to an inadvertent misconfiguration of the audio panel earlier in the flight. After flying through the final approach course twice, the pilot may have elected to attempt to locate the unlit runway using the airplane's landing light, the airplane's onboard global positioning system receivers, and/or the airport's precision approach path indicator lights as a guide. However, as he turned the airplane toward the dark area located southwest of the runway threshold, he likely experienced spatial disorientation, lost awareness of the airplane's attitude, and allowed it to enter a right descending spiral, which continued to impact.",

The helicopter then collided with the ground as the pilot tried to avoid wires during the autorotative descent.  The pilot said that the start, warm-up, and takeoff were normal.  As the helicopter climbed through 200 feet, he heard a bang and sensed a total loss of power; he then entered an autorotation to a clear ramp area of the airport.  The pilot said that during the descent he had \"to pull some pitch to miss some electric wires,\" and then the helicopter hit hard on the ramp.  Several witnesses with helicopter experience said the helicopter was about 75-100 feet in the air when the engine lost power.  One witness saw a white puff of smoke emanate from the exhaust nozzle and then heard silence.  An experienced helicopter pilot saw the accident pilot stretch his autorotative glide to miss wires that were right in his path and then hit hard and flat at the end of the autorotation.  The pilot who flew the accident helicopter the day before the mishap parked the helicopter in front of the terminal building, facing west-northwest at the end of the day, and did not install the engine inlet or exhaust covers.  This was the first flight of the day for the accident helicopter.  Another company pilot had been awake from 0500 and saw snow falling until about 0700.  He and the accident pilot used brooms, squeegees, and brushes to clean the snow off the helicopters during their preflights.  He said that about 75 percent of his preflight time was spent in removing the accumulated snow and ice off his helicopter, principally from the upper deck, roof, and doghouse.  He noted that about 1/8-inch of snow had accumulated on the upper surfaces of his aircraft.  The witness stated that he found and removed \"less than a handful of snow from the engine intakes.\"  He watched the accident pilot on a step ladder brushing snow off the top of his helicopter.  He said that neither his nor the accident pilot's helicopters had the intake or exhaust covers installed while they were parked overnight on the ramp.  Official weather records from the National Weather Service show that blowing snow conditions occurred periodically during the late night of April 17 and early morning hours of April 18, with 0.24 inches of snowfall recorded.  The winds were generally from the west-southwest during this period at velocities up to 16 knots.  The engine was not equipped with an auto reignition system.  The helicopter's airframe engine inlet area was not equipped with a particle separator or snow baffles.  According to Rolls Royce Allison, testing performed in 1968 showed that as little as 30 grams of snow/slush (25 percent water) ingested in the engine inlet can induce a flameout in the Allison 250 series commercial engines.  The first impact point was found 56 feet from a 50-foot-high power line strung between light poles, which bordered the crash site.  During extensive examinations of the wreckage, no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures were found to any control system, or to any component related to the ability of the engine to produce power and deliver it to the rotors.  Clear fuel was found in the fuel lines and filters, and, all fuel and pneumatic line B-nut fittings and connections were tight.  When electrical power was connected, both boost pumps operated and pumped fuel.  Following examination of the engine in the wreckage, it was removed from the helicopter and installed in a test cell for a run in an as removed condition.  The engine exceeded new engine minimum horsepower limits for a 250-C30P at all test points, except for takeoff power.  At the takeoff power test point, the engine was 0.6-percent (4 horsepower) below the minimum limit.  In his written statement, which was composed 29 days after the accident, the accident pilot said that during his preflight he \"checked the inlets very thoroughly for any snow\" and found none.  The pilot observed that following removal of the snow and ice from the airframe, the helicopter sat \"in the sun warming for a good 30 minutes before flight.\"  NWS records show that the temperature at the time of the accident was 3 degrees C.",
            "probable_cause": "A snow ingestion caused loss of engine power due to the pilot's inadequate preflight inspection and failure to remove the accumulated snow from the engine inlet area.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to maintain main rotor rpm while maneuvering to avoid power lines directly in his path during the autorotation necessitated by the loss of power.  While the failure to maintain proper rotor rpm is listed as causal, the Safety Board acknowledges that the pilot's successful avoidance of the power lines, which required expenditure of rotor energy, likely precluded a more severe accident."

The briefing also included an AIRMET for occasional moderate rime or mixed ice in clouds and precipitation from 6,000 to 12,000 feet msl, and a PIREP for light rime ice at 5,000 feet msl.  About 20 minutes after departure, and cruising in IMC conditions at 5,000 feet for approximately 10 minutes, the pilot observed snow.  Several minutes later, the engine lost all power, and the pilot then applied the carburetor heat as part of his restart checklist.  The engine did not restart, and the pilot performed a forced landing to trees.  FAA Advisory Circular AC 20-113 cautioned pilots of impact ice forming on intake screens and carburetors when flying in snow.  The circular advised pilots to use carburetor heat as a preventative measure, rather than as a deicer.  After the accident, an FAA inspector attended a test run of the accident engine.  The inspector stated that the engine started with no difficulty and ran continuously.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various sources and may not have traveled in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft incident report.The airplane unexpectedly rolled to the left during the climb to cruise.  The takeoff and initial area departure phases were normal.  The captain engaged the autopilot at 3,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  Passing 8,900 feet msl, the airplane experienced a sudden upset resulting in a rapid roll of 35 degrees to the left.  The captain countered with 50 to 60 degrees of right aileron input.  The autopilot had been engaged, but disengaged automatically during the pilot control input.  The first officer (FO) asked the captain if he wanted some aileron trim.  The captain responded that he desired only a small amount, reasoning that he did not want to mask a major problem.  He did not feel any vibration, binding, or unusual control feel other than the effort and aileron input required to hold wings level.  He remembered seeing the right aileron and right elevator deflected upward on the Configuration synoptic page on the systems display, and thought that the aileron deflection would be consistent with his control input to lower the right wing against a left rolling tendency.   He flew the airplane to a landing with approximately 45 degrees yoke deflection required to maintain a level wing attitude.  Analysis of the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data indicated that the aileron trim value was 90 percent of full aileron trim authority prior to pushback, engine start, taxi, and takeoff.  The data from the previous inbound flight, which had the same flight crew showed that the trim changed from 10 to 90 percent authority about 3 minutes after the previous flight landed.  The trim again shifted following the landing and taxi back of the event flight from 85 percent to 10 percent.  The captain said that he felt that the airplane was not tracking properly after takeoff.  The airline's debrief of the flight crew indicated that they did not see or recognize the excessive aileron deflection on the cockpit screens before or after the event worsened and resulted in autopilot disengagement.  The autopilot was trying to roll out of a turn, and was commanding aileron in a direction opposite to the trim position, which resulted in the aileron torque limiter reducing the aileron authority.  With the reduced authority, the aileron position could not keep up with the autopilot command, which triggered a autopilot disconnect.  The airline indicated that the Rudder and Aileron check for zero is done during the Cockpit Preparation Checklist, which a crew accomplishes just prior to the Before Starting Engines Checklist.  DFDR data about 2/3 of the way through the flight indicated that the trim did respond when the copilot manipulated it.  The data also showed that the trim repositioned back to zero at the end of the flight.  Thorough post accident tests of the system found that the aileron trim control switches and the aileron trim control actuator unit functioned per design specifications with no mechanical or circuit discrepancies noted.  Testing demonstrated that there was no evidence of any uncommanded motion.   Tests were also performed on the Aileron and Rudder Trim Control Module (ARTCM) and no faults were found.",

The airplane caught fire as it skidded down the runway.  The left inboard main tire had blown on takeoff and a 30-inch section of tread was loose.  Black marks were along the length of the landing gear strut and up into the wheel well directly above the left inboard wheel.  The normal and emergency hydraulic systems both connect to a common valve body on the landing gear actuator.  This valve body also had black marks on it.  A gap of 0.035 inch was measured between the valve body and actuator.  When either the normal or auxiliary hydraulic system was pressurized, red fluid leaked from this gap.  Examination revealed that one of two bolts holding the hydraulic control valve in place had fractured and separated.  The fractured bolt experienced a shear load that was oriented along the longitudinal axis of the actuator in a plane consistent with impact forces from the flapping tire tread section..  Separation of only one bolt allowed the control valve to twist about the remaining bolt in response to the load along the actuator's longitudinal axis.  This led to a loss of clamping force on that side of the actuator.  Hydraulic line pressure lifted the control valve, which resulted in rupture of an o-ring that sealed the hydraulic fluid passage.  14 CFR 25.739 describes the requirement for protection of equipment in wheel wheels from the effects of tire debris.  The revision of this regulation in effect at the time the airplane's type design was approved by the FAA requires that equipment and systems essential to safe operation of the airplane that is located in wheel wells must be protected by shields or other means from the damaging effects of a loose tire tread, unless it is shown that a loose tire tread cannot cause damage.   Examination of the airplane and the FAA approved production drawings disclosed that no shields were installed to protect the hydraulic system components in the wheel well.",

The flightcrew heard a thud and noticed that the left engine was surging.  White smoke filled the cabin and cockpit.  The flightcrew donned their oxygen masks, declared an emergency and initiated an emergency descent to Kansas City International Airport (MCI), Kansas City, Missouri.  While descending towards MCI, the flight crew changed their emergency landing destination to Whiteman Air Force Base (SZL), Knob Noster, Missouri, when they were approximately 18 miles north of SZL.  Flight crews are not issued approach charts for SZL by their operator.  The flight crew requested the runway 19 instrument landing system (ILS) frequency from air traffic control (ATC) and were issued the incorrect frequency.  The flight crew also requested and was given the inbound course for ILS 19.  The flight crew never obtained the correct ILS frequency for the remainder of the flight and relied upon a radar approach to SZL.  During the approach, ATC instructed the flight crew to maintain the a minimum vectoring altitude of 2,500 feet mean sea level. The flight crew descended below minimum vectoring altitudes of 2,500 feet mean sea level to 1,800 feet msl in order to descend below a cloud layer which was 1,400 feet above ground level during the radar approach to SZL.   A metallurgical examination revealed a fatigue fracture of one fan blade. Examination of the left engine revealed that the fan exit case exhibited a 360 degree fan exit case fracture.  Several service bulletins (SBs) applicable to the fan exit case introduce a newer engine case made of steel to replace the older aluminum case and to install stops to restrict the axial separation of the case in the event of case fracturing.  The SBs state that there have been 5 instances of full 360 degree fan exit case fracture, all due to fan blade fracture.  They further state that when the case fractures, the front of the engine with the cowl shifts forward.  The incident engine had an aluminum fan exit case and did not have stops installed.  ",

The accident occurred in an area that commonly had turbulent conditions.  The airplane fragmented; the right canard and elevator were not in the main debris field, and were found about 1/2 mile from the main wreckage.  The canard and elevator damage was not symmetrical.  The left side remained intact and attached to the fuselage while the right side separated near the fuselage attachment points.  All that remained of the right canard was the top skin, which had scattered patches of paint missing.  The owner and the pilot built the airplane together.  They acquired pieces for the airplane from different sources, and assembled the airplane.  The owner did not recall who actually built the elevator.  They obtained advice and technical suggestions from various builders of the model at their home field.  They did not contact the kit manufacturer during construction.  The kit manufacturer maintained close contact with builders through newsletters and a company website.  They designed an improvement to the elevator, which incorporated a wider chord.  They recommended that owners make the change if they had not flown their airplane.  The manufacturer provided a full size diagram so that builders could physically place their piece on top of the drawing to insure that their manufactured piece conformed to the drawing.  The accident elevator did not conform to the kit manufacturer's instructions.  In a newsletter to builders, the manufacturer informed them that the airplanes would be difficult or even dangerous to fly if the elevators did not have the correct cross section.  The kit manufacturer repeatedly stressed the importance of the correct shape, weight, and balance of the elevators in their newsletters.  On two occasions, once in 1979 and again in 1988, they noted that builders had installed balance weights in improper locations.  In one case the builder experienced flutter, and investigation determined that he added weight to balance a reconstructed elevator.  Instead of dividing the added weight between inboard and outboard mass balance points, he placed them all on the inboard point.  The manufacturer noted that this was incorrect, and that the balance weights should not all be installed inboard.  They stated that any variance of weight, stiffness, or shape from recommended design specifications should be considered dangerous, and builders should discard elevators that did not conform.  The accident airplane had a large number of balance weights, and all of them were at the inboard mass balance point.",

He stated that he suspected the engine roughness may have been due to carburetor ice, or a fuel-air mixture that was too lean so he applied carburetor heat and set the mixture control to full rich. The engine continued to run rough. The pilot stated that he then attempted to switch fuel tanks, and cycled the ignition switch to test the magnetos. The pilot reported that the airplane had approximately twice the required amount of fuel for the flight. When all efforts to restore engine power failed, the pilot executed a forced landing on an island. During the landing, the tires sank into the soft sandy soil.
