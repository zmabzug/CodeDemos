The pilot immediately aborted the takeoff and stopped the airplane on the runway using brakes and reverse propeller thrust. The pilot inspected the airplane and found that the right main landing gear tire had blown, and the right aileron had buckled at the aileron midspan hinge location. There were no scuff marks or indentations to indicate that the hinge or area around the hinge had been struck by debris. The hinge was still attached to the aileron, but the attach bracket that connected the hinge to the wing had fractured. Metallurgical examination revealed that the failure of the hinge bracket was the result of overstress forces applied to the hinge. Overstress failure of only the midspan hinge is somewhat unusual when none of the other hinges were damaged, which suggests modal vibration forces concentrated at this particular hinge. It is likely that the flat tire could have induced the vibratory mode in the aileron at the midspan hinge.",

The airplane departed from a satellite airstrip about 0400 mountain standard time (MST), in order to spray an agricultural field located approximately 5 miles east of the airstrip. When the airplane failed to return to the airstrip at the expected time, the loader became concerned. He telephoned the owner, and the owner initiated a search for the airplane. About 0545, the wreckage was located, approximately 125 feet above, and 1/2 mile to the west of, the field being sprayed, on rocky, rising terrain. Examination by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that airplane struck the terrain in a relatively level attitude, while on an approximate track of northwest, and came to rest facing southwest. The commercial pilot stated that he completed several passes on the field, and was maneuvering the airplane for another pass, when the wind shifted.

According to radar data, about 11 minutes after takeoff, the airplane leveled off at 14,800 feet mean sea level (msl). About 30 minutes later, when the airplane was still about 150 miles from its destination, air traffic controllers observed the airplane beginning to descend. When air traffic controllers subsequently questioned the pilot as to his intensions, the pilot\u2019s responses were garbled and unintelligible. Radar data indicated that the airplane continued a meandering descent until it descended through about 11,000 feet msl and radar contact was lost. The airplane impacted terrain in a right-wing-low attitude, and the debris field extended about 830 feet. Postaccident examination revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The investigation revealed that the pilot had flown for about 40 minutes at altitudes exceeding 12,500 feet msl, with much of that time spent at 14,600 feet msl. At these altitudes, without the use of supplemental oxygen, the pilot would have become hypoxic (insufficient brain oxygen). Although the pilot\u2019s wife indicated that he typically used supplemental oxygen when operating above 11,000 feet msl and supplemental oxygen was available to the pilot during the flight, postaccident investigation indicated that no cockpit oxygen ports were in use when the accident occurred.  The degree of hypoxia experienced by the pilot would have severely degraded his performance. Both the garbled transmissions to air traffic controllers and the airplane\u2019s meandering flight path are consistent with the pilot experiencing symptomatic hypoxia.

The commercial rated pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, which departed Franklin County State Airport (FSO), Highgate, Vermont about 1200.According to the pilot, He had just recently returned from an airshow in Florida where he had been performing aerobatics with the airplane. On the day of the accident, he was performing a \"high-level shakedown\" flight, which was his common practice after a long cross country flight. He stated that \"the shakedown flight is made at a higher altitude to ensure the satisfactory condition of the aircraft\". He departed FSO at approximately 1200 (he reports this is his normal daily practice time) and departed the traffic pattern to the west. He then climbed to 3,000 feet above mean sea level (msl), over some farm fields. He went to begin his high-level shakedown maneuvers but since he was in a \"flat pitch attitude\" decided to head approximately northeast. As he did so, there was a sudden loud bang/shudder and the canopy shattered. The pilot initially thought there was some type of catastrophic structural failure, and thought a wing had failed. The engine \"stopped instantly\" and the canopy \"clam-shell opened and then slammed back down\". He realized that the airplane was \"un-flyable\" after trying to control the airplane with the flight controls. The airplane then began to spin and he could not arrest the spin. He related that it seemed like a \"car accident\" loud and sudden and that it seemed the aircraft had lost a lot of forward airspeed. He advised that before every flight he would practice his egress routine. When he realized that he could not arrest the spin and the airplane was un-flyable, he decided to leave the airplane and initiated an egress. The egress went as planned but his headset jacks would not unplug easily and he ended up breaking them off. He advised that this caused him some concern and a challenge to alleviate the issue. He could not remember what altitude he egressed from the airplane but, after exiting the airplane, his parachute deployed fully at 700 to 1,000 feet msl, and he came to rest in the top of a tree. According to two witnesses at FSO, They were both familiar with the pilot's airshow practice routine, and the airplane. Both witnesses stated that a couple of minutes after the airplane took off that they heard a normal engine noise followed by a \"pop\" or a \"bang\". They both stated that they then ran to the open door of the hangar they were in and looked to the northwest of the airport they saw that the pilot had egressed the airplane and was already descending under a fully deployed chute. They stated that he was approximately 500' to 1,000 feet high and above the trees and was drifting to the northeast.The airplane was later discovered on the shoulder of the north bound lane of Interstate 89 were it had impacted, and was subject to a post impact fire which consumed the majority of the airplane.

The pilot made a 180 degree turn toward the departure lake, but the airplane stalled and impacted trees.  The pilot said he had moored the airplane for a week in the rain with the fuel tanks three-quarters empty.  The morning of the accident, he fueled both tanks with a mixture of aviation and auto fuel.  He said the preflight and engine run-up were normal, and that he used carburetor heat when the engine was idling, but not during step-taxi or takeoff.  He said as the airplane climbed over trees along the shore, the engine backfired twice, and quit completely.  At the site, the NTSB investigator found 5-6 pieces of \"chopped\" wood, each piece was about 18 inches long, about 2 inches in diameter, and appeared to have been cut by the airplane's propeller sometime during the uncontrolled descent.  The engine was not accessible, and was not examined.  The airplane was disassembled by agents for the pilot and stored.  The pilot reported that with the airplane on floats, the wings were in a more level attitude than when sitting on the tailwheel, and any water in the tanks was more likely to move away from the sumps.  He added that his practice of standing on the front of the floats while taking the fuel samples probably moved any contaminants further from the sumps.   The pilot reported that in his opinion, the loss of power was due to water contamination of the fuel as a result of leaving the tanks three-quarters empty during a rainy period, in conjunction with a flawed sumping procedure.",

They each flew their airplanes from their homes to Biloxi for the show. On the evening of November 15, 2001, he and the accident pilot flew to Biloxi, and parked their airplanes at the Ocean Springs Airport, in Ocean Springs. After the performance, he and the accident pilot visited with the cast and crew. The accident pilot may have had some beer and wine, he is not sure, but, he did not seem impaired. During the drive back to the airport, to fly home, they stopped at a convenience store so the accident pilot could buy cigarettes. He does not know if the accident pilot bought beer or anything else. At the airport, they each did a pre-flight inspection of their airplanes, and departed one after the other around 0100. The accident pilot departed first. The accident pilot flew a northerly course for a time. He flew a 300 degree course toward his destination of McComb, Mississippi. He, the friend of the accident pilot,  was talking with the accident pilot via the radio. It was a clear, cold night, with no clouds. Visibility was greater than 50 miles. He could see the lights of the accident airplane and saw it was further north than he would expect and at a lower altitude than he thought it should be at. The accident pilot indicated he had been having a sticky altimeter. The accident pilot turned toward him and came in a mile behind him. He was at 4,500 feet and the accident airplane appeared to be at the same altitude. The friend lost sight of the airplane, but continued to talk to the accident pilot via radio. A short time later, the friend of the pilot had an alternator over-voltage indication. He reported this to the accident pilot, and the accident pilot indicated he would turn and follow him to McComb, which was about 30 minutes away. As he approached to land at McComb, the accident pilot reported he was behind him, although the friend could not see him.  When he was on a one-mile final approach, he told the accident pilot that he was on final. The accident pilot told him to call him when he was on the ground. About two minutes later he called to tell the accident pilot he was on the ground. He did not get a response from the accident pilot. When the accident pilot failed to show up for the musical show in Ocean Springs on the evening of November 16, 2001, the friend reported him missing to an FAA Flight Service Station. Search and rescue operations were initiated and the accident pilot and airplane were located on November 30, 2001, about 1630. Radar data showed N89645 departed Ocean Springs Airport at approximately 0104 and proceeded in a northwesterly direction of approximately 295 degrees.  About one minute later, N739LV, piloted by the accident pilot's friend, departed.  At about 0112, N739LV passed N89645 at 3,600 feet, 4 miles north of Biloxi, MS.  No transponder returns were received from N89645.  Both airplanes flew a similar course until 0118:45 when N89645 turned to a course of approximately 320 degrees, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.  At 0124:02, N739LV began a series of turns corresponding with the pilot's statement that he was distracted by an alternator problem. At 0127:38, N89645 turned left to a course of about 270 degrees. The airplane was about 10 miles east of Poplarville, Mississippi at 3,600 feet. N739LV flew directly to MCB and landed at about 0158. At 0132:02, N89645 passed two miles southeast of Poplarville at 3,600 feet on a course of approximately 220 degrees.  For the next 20 minutes, N89645 descended and made numerous turns within 10 miles of Poplarville, in an area south and southwest of the airport.  The last radar return was received at 0153:14, eight miles southeast of Poplarville. Post crash examination of the crash site showed the airplane had collided with a tree, severing the outboard right wing, right horizontal stabilizer, and right main landing gear wheel. The airplane continued 100 feet across a river and crashed on the river bank. All components of the airplane which are neccessary for flight were located at the crash site.

They set up for the third simulated autorotation from an altitude of 700 feet agl, and the instructor advised the student to tighten the turn to compensate for the lower altitude.   Approximately 90 degrees into the turn, the instructor noticed that the airspeed was high.  The student began the landing flare and the helicopter began to shutter.  At that point, the instructor assumed control, but could not arrest the descent rate, nor decrease the airspeed.  The instructor applied forward cyclic and the helicopter contacted the runway and bounced approximately 10 feet into the air.   The helicopter sustained substantial damage as a result of ground impact.",
            "probable_cause": "the student's failure to maintain control of the helicopter.  Contributing factors were high airspeed, high rate of descent, the instructor's delay in taking remedial action, and the instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight."

Soon thereafter the aircraft's engine suddenly stopped producing power. Because he was unable to get the engine restarted, he descended straight ahead, and eventually lowered the landing gear for an attempted off-field power-off landing. Although he was able to make an uneventful touchdown in a rough open snow-covered field, as the aircraft began to roll, its wheels sunk into the snow, and all three gear legs collapsed. When the gear collapsed the airframe contacted the terrain and sustained substantial damage. After the accident, recorded data was downloaded from the aircraft's electronic engine fuel control system, and it was determined that at the time of the power loss, fuel pressure to the engine was within normal parameters, but N1 rpm and ITT (inter-turbine-temperature) were dropping. An inspection of the engine did not reveal an evidence of any anomaly or malfunction, but it was discovered that just upstream from the compressor, and just downstream from the NACA-form engine air inlet ducts, was a protective screen with one-eight inch diameter openings in its surface. The loss of power during the sudden OAT increase was consistent with the previously dry snow becoming wet and heavy during the rapid temperature increase, and then accumulating on the aforementioned protective screen, starving the engine of inlet air. ",
            "probable_cause": "The accumulation of wet snow on the engine inlet assembly protection screen during a rapid increase in outside air temperature, while on an instrument approach for landing. Factors include falling snow, a sudden and significant increase in outside air temperature, and rough, snow covered terrain in the area where the pilot found it necessary to attempt a forced landing."

The pilot and one passenger were fatally injured, a second passenger was seriously injured, and a 2-year old child sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot. Day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and a flight plan had not been filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. At the time of the accident the airplane was departing ABI for a local flight.The airplane was taking off to the south and was about 200 feet above ground level when the pilot declared an emergency and reported to the tower controller that he needed to return. A witness saw the southbound airplane in a steep left bank and several witnesses heard the sounds of impact. The airplane was generally northbound when it impacted mesquite trees and terrain about one mile south of the airport. The impact resulted in the complete separation from the fuselage of the forward fuselage, engine and propeller. The wing was also completely separated from the fuselage and both wing fuel tanks were compromised. All three adult occupants were ejected or partially ejected. The child in the rear seat remained restrained by a 4-point safety harness and was removed from the wreckage by emergency responders who arrived quickly. There no postimpact fire.",

After takeoff, the pilot selected the landing gear to the \u201cup\u201d position. The pilot noticed that the main landing gear retracted but that the nose landing gear did not. He then \u201ccompleted the emergency check,\u201d selected the gear \u201cdown\u201d position, and subsequently observed three \u201cgear down and locked\u201d lights illuminate. After discussing the situation with an air traffic controller, the pilot decided to return to the airport to land. The touchdown was normal; however, during the landing roll, as the airplane decelerated, the nose landing gear collapsed, and the airplane\u2019s nose and propellers contacted the runway, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane. Examination of the nose landing gear assembly revealed that the nose landing gear actuator was intact, extended, and undamaged but that the rod end, which had its castellated nut still threaded onto it, was not connected to the nose landing gear drag brace. Review of maintenance records and discrepancy sheets revealed no evidence that maintenance had been performed on the nose landing gear assembly. However, review of worksheets that the operator had given to the repair station indicated that the operator had requested that nondestructive testing (NDT) be performed on the nose landing gear drag brace. Although the worksheets were supposed to be used to document the inspections, repair station personnel did not fill them out. However, a work order sent to the operator by the NDT technician, who was a contractor, did indicate that NDT had been performed on the nose landing gear drag brace. \u000b\u000bThe repair station\u2019s chief inspector stated that, for previous NDT of the nose landing gear brace, repair station personnel had always removed the part from the airplane. However, after the chief inspector met with the operator\u2019s mechanic and the pilot to discuss the maintenance to be performed, they decided that the repair station did not have to be involved in the NDT that day because the nose landing gear brace actually did not need to be removed for the NDT. Thus, the chief inspector did not enter the NDT on the discrepancy sheets. The chief inspector reported that, initially, no one involved in the airplane\u2019s maintenance could remember if anyone had worked on or near the nose landing gear; however, a mechanic subsequently reported that he had disconnected and removed the bolt from the nose landing gear actuator at the request of the NDT technician to facilitate the NDT of the nose landing gear. The chief inspector further reported that neither the mechanic nor the NDT technician communicated to anyone that the bolt had been removed or took any actions that might have alerted anyone that the bolt was not in place; evidence indicates that the bolt was not reinstalled, which could have been detected during a postmaintenance inspection. However, the chief inspector reported that, because the nose landing gear drag brace inspection was not on the discrepancy sheet and it had not been removed for maintenance, it did not occur to him to inspect it before releasing the airplane to service. The inspector\u2019s failure to inspect the drag brace led to its being returned to service without the bolt attached and its subsequent failure. \u000b\u000bThe evidence indicates that confusion existed regarding what each person\u2019s and organization\u2019s responsibilities were and that a breakdown in communication occurred between the repair station personnel, the NDT technician, and the operator. These factors, coupled with the lack of oversight by the chief inspector, led to a breakdown in the controls put in place to detect and correct errors before an accident occurs. \u000b\u000b",

The airplane was parked outside for approximately 10 days until the pilot returned.  Prior to his departure for the return flight, the pilot preflighted the airplane to include draining all four fuel tank sumps, and did not identify any contaminates in the fuel.  He then started the engine, completed the runup checks, and departed.  After approximately 20 to 25 minutes, and while level at 7,500 feet msl, the engine lost all power.  The pilot changed tanks, and selected each magneto independently, but was unsuccessful at restarting the engine.  The pilot then attempted to perform a forced landing to an airport, but struck trees short of the runway.  A post-accident examination of the engine did not reveal any mechanical deficiencies; however, an examination of the airframe revealed that all four fuel caps seals had varying degrees of deterioration, and the left main fuel cap was loose.

The post-accident examination of the aircraft recovered approximately 8 ounces of fuel from the fuel tanks.  No fuel was present in the fuel line running from the firewall to the engine.  The fuel tanks and lines appeared to be intact and no evidence of fuel leakage was observed.  The pilot stated that he did not visually confirm the fuel level before flight.  He reported referencing remaining fuel quantity from a fuel management computer installed in the aircraft.  The operating manual for the fuel management computer stated:  \"[The fuel management computer] is a fuel flow measuring system and NOT a quantity-sensing device.  A visual inspection and positive determination of the usable fuel in the fuel tanks is a necessity.  Therefore, it is imperative that the determined available usable fuel be manually entered into the system.\"",
            "probable_cause": "An inadequate pre-flight inspection by the pilot due to his failure to visually confirm fuel quantity prior to flight, and the resulting fuel exhaustion.  Contributing factors were the pilot's improper use of the fuel management computer installed in the aircraft, and the tree located in the middle of the emergency landing field."

Although there was a discrepancy between the accident time as noted by the pilot and the approximate time noted by local authorities, there was a quartering tailwind at both times, ranging in velocity from 3 to 6 knots. In addition, temperatures and dew points from both times indicated a probability of carburetor ice formation during the pilot's reported 4 to 5 minutes of low-power taxi prior to takeoff. The extent to which a tailwind, carburetor ice, or some other phenomena might have singularly or cumulatively affected takeoff and climb performance could not be determined. However, it is likely that diminished performance existed throughout the airplane's takeoff roll, which should have allowed the pilot ample time to recognize it and to safely abort the takeoff in a timely manner.",

The 5 crewmembers and 47 passengers were fatally injured.  The lone survivor sustained serious injuries.  The airplane was operated by Intercontinental de Aviacion, S.A., a domestic scheduled carrier. The flight, operating as Intercontinental Flight 256 (ITC256), was on an IFR flight plan from Santafe de Bogota, to Cartagena, Colombia. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 14 CFR Part 121 night flight. Flight 256 was scheduled to depart at 1230.  The operations officer stated that the flight was delayed due to maintenance being performed on the aircraft electrical systems.  The aircraft departed the El Dorado International Airport (BOG), Bogota, Colombia, at 1843, for Cartagena, Colombia, on flight that was scheduled to continued on to San Andres, Panama City, Cali, and returning to Bogota.  The dispatcher on duty stated that prior to releasing the flight for departure he observed that the pilot in command was seated on the right seat, while the first officer completed the walk-around inspection.  The flight was cleared to Cartagena via the Bogota SID # 2 (Zipaquira departure) via A-301 Barranca Bermeja VOR, W-10 Cartagena, at an assigned altitude of 31,000 feet.  According to ATC reports, as the flight approached Cartagena, the aircraft was cleared by Barranquilla center to descent from 19,000 feet, for and assigned altitude of 8,000 feet, and was told  to report passing 12,000 feet. The last transmission received from the crew of Intercontinental 256 was recorded at 1934:15.  At 1938, the crew from Aerocorales 209, a Cessna Caravan in cruise flight at 9,000 feet reported \"the lights of an airplane in rapid descend,\" at their two o'clock position.  At approximately 1942, while still at 9,000 feet, the crew reported observing a ground explosion at their one o'clock position, for about 10 to 19 seconds, approximately 29 to 30 miles from their position on the airway.  Several eyewitnesses near the village of Flamenco, reported observing the airplane just prior to ground impact.  They reported observing lights, sparks, fire, and the left wing navigation light.

The midair collision occurred about 2 minutes after the Cessna 150M had taken off from runway 25, turned crosswind, and was entering on the downwind leg. Radar data shows that during this time, a Cessna 172N completed a course change maneuver and was proceeding inbound toward the airport on a 034-degree true course, which approximated the 45-degree traffic pattern's entry path to the downwind leg. The north-northeast-bound Cessna 172N impacted the right side of the southeast-bound Cessna 150M after the airplanes were flying on converging courses for about 13 seconds. The collision angle was about 70 degrees. The four occupants in the airplanes and one person on the ground were killed. Calculations based on radar data show that the Cessna 150M pilot turned onto the crosswind leg prior to reaching 700 feet above ground level, which is contrary to the Federal Aviation Administration's recommended procedures. A visibility study determined that while on the crosswind leg and during the turn onto the downwind leg, the Cessna 150M pilot had 14-second window of opportunity to observe the approaching Cessna 172N, which was travelling at 106 knots (ground speed), but was likely not able to see it in the final 9 seconds prior to the collision as the Cessna 150 was turning left onto the downwind leg.

            "narrative": "On October 16, 2014, about 1230 eastern daylight time, an Aeronca 7AC airplane, N946DR, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain shortly after takeoff from Crisp County Cordele Airport (CKF), Cordele, Georgia. The private pilot was fatally injured and the passenger received serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The planned cross-country flight departed from CKF at 1230 and was destined for Peach State Airport (GA2), Williamson, Georgia. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to witnesses, the accident airplane was the first of four airplanes to depart in sequence from runway 28, a 5,001-foot-long, 150-foot-wide, asphalt runway. The airplane lifted off from the runway about midfield and started a climb. After reaching about 150 feet above ground level, the airplane entered a gradual left turn that progressed into a steep turn and slight descent. The airplane then entered a nose down attitude before it impacted the ground, spun around and came to rest. The airplane came to rest in a grass area in a flat attitude, on a southerly heading about 350 feet from the runway. All major components of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. The wings remained attached to the fuselage; the right wing displayed both outboard and inboard leading edge crush damage and the inboard wood spar was broken at the fuselage. The inboard section of the left wing exhibited vertical crush damage. No damage was noted on the elevator and rudder control surfaces and the elevator trim tab was observed in the slight nose up position. Both propeller blades remained attached to the propeller hub. Blade A exhibited some chordwise scratches and curling at the blade tip. Blade B also displayed chordwise scratches and a slight bend at the blade tip. Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that the airplane right wing made contact with the ground before the airplane spun and came to rest. Further postaccident examination of the airframe was conducted at a secure facility and fuel system continuity was confirmed from the wing tanks, through the fuel gascolater, to the engine. Flight control continuity was established from the control stick in the cockpit to the ailerons and elevator, and from the rudder pedals to the rudder.Examination of the seat belt restraints revealed that the pilot's lab belt and shoulder harness had been cut by the first responder team.The pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on December 11, 2013. At that time, he reported a total flight experience of 3,098 hours; of which, 88 hours were flown during the previous 6 months.A handheld Garmin 396 global positioning system receiver was recovered from the cockpit and forwarded to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory, Washington, DC, for download.The engine was retained for further examination.",

Subsequent to that accident, he acquired an experimental amateur-built airplane, which he would only taxi because of his lack of medical clearance. Anticipating a return to medical status, the pilot asked another pilot to serve as pilot in command and fly with him to another airport for the airplane\u2019s condition inspection.There were no witnesses to the engine start, taxi time, or takeoff to the north. An air traffic controller at a nearby air force base was contacted by one of the pilots, who reported that the airplane just departed the airport, as was the custom. The controller then attempted to contact the airplane twice to determine the pilots\u2019 intentions but received no response. Radar data indicated a brief, primary (skin paint) return at the time, but no track or altitude could be determined. During the initial climb, a witness saw the airplane when it was about halfway down, and about 300 to 400 feet above the runway, and heard a power reduction. The airplane did not turn to return to the runway, but continued straight ahead over trees, and the witness eventually lost the sound of the engine. A motorist subsequently saw the airplane, gliding south, back toward the departure airport with the propeller stopped, before he lost sight of it behind trees. The airplane later impacted trees, wings level, heading eastbound, just north of a new highway. Because both pilots were ejected from the airplane, it was not possible to determine which pilot had been in which seat or who was flying. The engine had also separated from the main wreckage, which likely altered the positions of the engine controls, including the carburetor heat. Torsional bending of one of the propeller blades, as well as malleable bending (heating) of the exhaust system indicated that the engine was under some power at impact; an examination of the engine did not reveal any malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Dark  spark plug electrodes were noted and are consistent with a very rich mixture, either from carburetor icing or carburetor heat, or both. Weather data recorded near the time of the accident indicated an outside air temperature of 82 degrees F and a dew point of 64 degrees. Carburetor icing probability charts indicated the likelihood of serious carburetor icing at glide power for the temperature and dew point conditions. Because one of the pilots made a normal departure call, the effects of carburetor ice were probably first noticed subsequent to that call. At some point, the engine lost power and the pilots attempted to turn back toward the airport. They were then likely able to at least regain at least some power, likely by applying carburetor heat, but were too low to recover. \u000b",

The takeoff roll commenced and at the calculated rotation speed (70 knots), he applied back pressure to the stick but noticed an unusual amount of load on the controls.  The takeoff roll continued and he performed trim adjustments.  He then aborted the takeoff by retarding the throttle, extending the speed brakes, and applying the wheel brakes.

The glider was towed to 12,600 feet mean sea level (msl) and released about 1028.  Around 1245, the pilot radioed that he was in the primary wave, climbing at 1,000 feet per minute, and was at 28,000 feet (msl). He then stated that he was going to crossover to Mauna Loa. The next day search aircraft identified widely scatted debris at 10,000 feet on the southwest face of the Mauna Loa Volcano. The glider was equipped with a flight data recorder, which depicted that the glider climbed to 20,375 feet msl near the town of Holualoa, flew east-northeast and rose to 30,116 feet msl over Mauna Kea, then proceeded south-southwest to Mauna Loa and climbed to 36,846 feet msl. Three minutes and twelve seconds from the end of the recording, at 38,630 feet, the track abruptly became linear from a constant-rate turn headed in a southwest direction, with the rate of descent rapidly increasing over the next 16 seconds to 24,000 feet per minute. At the beginning of the descent, the track exhibited a pitch oscillation before the descent rate accelerated. Fifty-six seconds from the end of the recording the track suddenly reversed course 180 degrees and descended almost vertically until the end of the data. The sudden course reversal can be associated with the structural failure of the airframe from very high aerodynamic loads. A large section of the left wing was located 3.4 miles downwind from the main wreckage, indicating that the left wing separated from the airframe at a high altitude. The spar cap fractures were consistent with a negative overload of the wing. Between 1315:23 and 1315:43, the true airspeed was calculated to increase from 60 knots to 120 knots, back to 103 knots, then 180 knots, and finally 241 knots. The operating limitation section of the glider\u2019s flight manual lists 146 knots (270 km/h) as the red line airspeed. At 20,000 feet indicated airspeed is limited to 117 knots for flutter prevention. The manufacturer stated that the airspeed limitation can be extrapolated linearly to 40,000 feet. Due to the extensive fragmentation of the airframe, the possibility of a flight control malfunction could not be ruled out.",

According to the pilot he radioed ATC that he had the airport and runway in sight.   At 800 feet he lost sight of the runway because of \"light fog.\" He performed a missed approach and stayed in the pattern VFR. On the second approach he was distracted by the fog, but said he did not lose sight of the runway.  He said that the co-pilot advised him to go around again but he landed.  He said the landing was hard, but did not realize he had a problem until the airplane started pulling to the left.  When the airplane came to a stop he got everyone out because of a fuel leak.  The 30-minute CVR recording was found to have no data that could contribute to determining the probable cause, and no transcript was prepared.  The reported visibility at the time of the accident was 0.25 sm mile with fog.  The pilot called the Saint Petersburg flight service station about 2 hours after the accident to report same.",

It then took off with one passenger. Shortly after lifting off, the pilot \"heard a loud pop as the nose of the aircraft passed over the edge of the helideck. The noise was simultaneously accompanied by illumination of the engine out warning light and a needle split indication was observed on the engine and rotor tachometer gauge. As the aircraft yawed and lost climb performance, the pilot lowered the collective pitch full down and activated the floats. Upon landing on the water, the aircraft rolled left until inverted. The helicopter was later recovered and the engine disassembled and examined. The only anomaly noted was a loose Pc line, which would cause a loss of fuel flow and subsequent loss of engine power down to or below idle. It was determined that the torque required to realign the B-nut would be between hand-tight and 27 inch-pounds. The required torque is 80 to 120 inch-pounds. Torque values on the other air line fittings between the power turbine governor and the fuel control were found to range from 55 to 85 inch-pounds.
