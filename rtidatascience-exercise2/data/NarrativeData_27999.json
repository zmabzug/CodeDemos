While enroute, they diverted to Key West, Florida, as a visit to the Miami area by the President of the United States was occurring and a temporary flight restriction (TFR) was in effect. Later that evening, when the TFR was cancelled, they departed on a night visual flight rules (VFR) flight to their original destination. Witness statements and a review of radar data revealed that after departure, the airplane's flight path became erratic before it entered a descent and impacted the water. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane or engine that would have precluded normal operation.Dark night visual conditions existed at the time of the accident. Because the airport was surrounded by water, the moon had already set, and no ground lighting existed in the area of the accident, it is unlikely that a discernable horizon was present. Examination of the airplane's maneuvers immediately after it departed were consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation, which Federal Aviation Administration guidance indicates can occur when there is no natural horizon or surface reference, such as a night flight in sparsely populated areas similar to that of the accident area. Further, spatial disorientation is more likely to occur if a pilot lacks proficiency in instrument flying. The pilot's private pilot certificate was issued on the basis of his Polish private pilot license, which did not authorize VFR night flights (his FAA certificate required him to comply with all restrictions and limitations of his Polish private pilot license). A review of his rental checkout form indicated that he had not received a checkout for night operations.The pilot-rated passenger's certificate did authorize him for night VFR flights, but the lack of a discernable horizon would have required him to reference the airplane's flight instruments to maintain attitude. Since he was not instrument-rated, was seated in the right front seat of the airplane, and did not have flight instruments mounted in the panel in front of him, it is unlikely that he could have positively influenced the outcome of the flight.",
            "probable_cause": "The non-night-qualified pilot's improper decision to depart in dark night visual meteorological conditions, which resulted in his subsequent spatial disorientation, loss of control, and impact with water."

According to the flight crew's statements, they noticed the vibration and loss of hydraulic fluid quantity and pressure shortly after VR.  They then observed a loss of right engine pressure ratio (EPR) and the right engine thrust reverser indication lights.  The flight crew reduced right engine power and landed uneventfully at the departure airport.  The post-incident examination of the right engine revealed the engine event was caused by the imbalance of the low pressure turbine (LPT) rotor due to a significant loss of the 4th stage blade airfoil and shroud material.  This imbalance resulted in rub between the LPT shaft and the high pressure turbine (HPT) shaft.  A hole was eventually rubbed through the LPT shaft.  Oil in the vicinity of this shaft rub was ignited, giving the LPT shaft the appearance of burn through.  The extent of the damage to other systems (hydraulic lines, EPR reference lines, fire warning systems, etc.) was attributed to the duration of excessive vibration experienced until the engine was safely shutdown.  Prior to the incident, the right engine was placed on a 50-cycle continue-in-service limitation in accordance with a P&W; internal engineering notice for missing 4th stage turbine blade shroud/shrouds.  At the time of the event, the right engine had accumulated 13 cycles of the 50-cycle limit.

While in cruise flight at 10,500 feet, the pilot encountered light and occasional moderate turbulence.  Because of the turbulence, the pilot reduced the engine power several times to slow the aircraft.  At least three times during the flight, the pilot lowered the landing gear to slow the aircraft and to increase stability.  While en route at an altitude of 8,500 feet, the engine lost power.  The pilot noticed on the fuel gauges that the right tank appeared empty and the left tank indicated more than 1/4 tank of fuel.  The pilot switched the fuel selector to the left tank and the engine regained power.  The pilot then decided to land at a nearby airport to add some fuel, check the magnetos and ground run the engine before continuing to his intended destination.  Approximately 9 miles from the airport, the pilot lowered the landing gear and initiated a descent to the airport's pattern altitude.  During the descent, the engine \"faltered and surged\" 4 to 5 times.  The pilot then trimmed the airplane for a 60 knot glide speed, declared an emergency on UNICOM frequency and attempted a landing to the nearest runway.  Shortly thereafter, the engine lost power, and the pilot initiated a forced landing to a field.  During the forced landing, the airplane contacted a fence and a berm, and the nose gear collapsed, buckling the firewall.

As the helicopter climbed out, he reported a sinking feeling in the seat and noticed that the vertical speed indicator displayed a descent. The pilot increased the engine power but the helicopter continued to descend. The pilot could not discern his exact height above the water because of the night lighting conditions and thought that the helicopter was higher off the water than it was; as a result, he did not flare prior to impact. A witness reported that the liftoff and initial climb also appeared normal and that the helicopter appeared to be level and remain in controlled flight the entire time. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

During extension of the landing gear, the 3 green (gear down/locked) lights failed to illuminate.  The pilot cycled the gear, but the lights again failed to illuminate.  He stated he thought he had heard all the appropriate sounds associated with proper landing gear extension, and elected to continue the landing, without attempting the manual extension of the gear as prescribed in the \"Emergency Procedures\" section of the pilot's operating handbook.  During the landing roll the landing gear collapsed.  Postaccident testing of the landing gear was conducted with the airplane on jacks.  Tests revealed that the charge on the battery was insufficient to extend the electrically operated landing gear completely.

The airplane lifted off approximately 1/3 of the length down the runway. After liftoff, one witness thought she heard popping and the airplane immediately turned approximately 40 degrees to the right in the approximate direction of the pilot's destination airport, which one witness stated was the pilot's usual practice. What appeared to be a thin trail of dark gray smoke or black smoke was observed trailing from the airplane. The airplane then reached a height of approximately 60 feet above ground level, leveled off, and the smoke stopped. Upon approaching a tree line that ran perpendicular to the right side of the runway, the airplane was observed to climb. The airplane cleared the trees by approximately 50 feet, stalled, entered a spin, and impacted the ground. A post crash fire then ensued. The airplane had been in a previous accident and it was reported to the NTSB that it may have had a preexisting engine problem. A postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction of the airplane or engine. During the takeoff, light rain was falling. This may have resulted in the formation of visible vapor during power application which could have appeared to the witnesses as smoke. It is also possible that the smoke may have been residual oil being burned off from a replacement of the oil cooler, which occurred 16 days prior to the accident, recent engine oil servicing, seepage of oil past the seals or rings while the airplane was parked, or a richer than normal mixture due to the atmospheric conditions that existed at the time. The popping that may have been heard could also have been caused by a richer than normal mixture.

The airplane completed 22 revolutions in the spin, with the engine running smoothly, and the stick held fully aft. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomaly. Review of the pilot's flight records revealed no evidence of formal aerobatic training. However, the records indicated that he had conducted aerobatic maneuvers, including, on at least one occasion, a flat spin.The on-board video recordings showed no signs of pilot distress or incapacitation and indicated that the pilot was actively engaged in controlling the airplane and was providing control inputs to maintain the spin to impact. There was no indication of any distracting event or of the pilot attempting to diagnose, troubleshoot, or respond to a perceived in-flight control, system, or engine anomaly. There were multiple cues available to the pilot that the maneuver should be terminated, including an increasing ground presence/perspective from the out-the-window view and the rapidly decreasing altitude indicated on the altimeter in the panel. However, the pilot failed to terminate the maneuver at an altitude adequate to prevent impacting the water. Therefore, it is most likely that the pilot lost situational awareness during the aerobatic maneuver/prolonged spin and did not recover from the spin before impact.Given the fact that this was a sustained aerobatic maneuver, it is possible that the pilot lost situational awareness due to target fixation, a phenomenon that can occur at varying levels ranging from a breakdown in an instrument scan to failing to pull out of an aerial application run. In these cases, the pilot has cues that a response is required and has the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully perform the response. However, because of the narrowing of attention resulting from the goal-directed activity associated with this phenomenon, a loss of overall situational awareness occurs and the appropriate response is not commanded/input. The circumstances of this accident are consistent with the loss of situational awareness due to target fixation. The pilot appears to have focused on the performance/sustainment of the spin maneuver and therefore misjudged or lost awareness of his exit altitude.",

The redesign process included finite element model analysis and various testing programs.  The original mount design had not incorporated these types of design tools.  Post-event engineering examination of the original engine mount and STC'd engine mount revealed that there was compliance (flexibility) in the engine mount actuator attach feet structure, sometimes resulting in the cracking of the engine mount at the actuator feet.  This compliance issue was sometimes exasperated at various speeds, resulting in a high speed shimmy effect and subsequent uncommanded left or right turn of the nose wheel during takeoff and/or landing.

The flight crew successfully extended the landing gear after completing the emergency landing gear extension procedure. One of the steps of the emergency extension procedure was to select the hydraulic system to OFF. The landing gear was then hand-pumped into the down-and-locked position.

He conducted the flight to his destination without the navigational publications for the route of flight, the instrument approaches at the destination airport, and with a Global Positioning System (GPS) navigational software data card that expired 4 years prior to the accident. Nearing his destination, the pilot contacted an air traffic controller and requested a non-directional beacon approach that was out of service, as posted in a notice to airman. The pilot then asked for a \"GPS overlay\" of the approach, and was advised that there was none. The pilot was issued a clearance for a GPS approach, subsequently reported crossing waypoints on the approach, then announced that his destination was in sight before cancelling his instrument clearance. There were no further transmissions received from the pilot.Examination of the airplane at the accident site, approximately one-half mile from the destination airport, revealed no evidence of fuel and no evidence of mechanical anomalies with the engine or airframe. A 375-ml bourbon bottle, which contained approximately 100 ml of bourbon, was removed from the pilot's pocket during the medical examiner's recovery at the site.Toxicological testing revealed that the pilot's blood alcohol content was 0.11 percent. A review of law enforcement and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records revealed that the pilot had been arrested for driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence (DUI) on at least two occasions, only one of which he reported. Further research of the pilot's records by the FAA revealed that they had improperly coded the pilot's medical application, which precluded the FAA from crosschecking information from his medical applications with the National Driver Register for potential alcohol-related motor vehicle actions. FAA processes did not independently identify at least two prior convictions of the pilot for DUI, though he had informed them of one of the events, and the FAA had not requested details of the offense reported. The NTSB obtained the arrest report for the event reported to the FAA by the pilot, and the arrest report noted that the pilot had been driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.20 percent. Given the pilot's history of multiple episodes of driving while intoxicated, and particularly given the level of tolerance exhibited by driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.20 percent, it is almost certain that he was substance dependent, a condition that is disqualifying for medical certification.

She then retracted the landing gear. As she was on downwind, she extended the landing gear and the green light for the nose gear momentarily flickered but became a solid green light.  As she turned onto the final leg of the traffic pattern, she verified that the landing gear were down and locked. Upon touchdown, she immediately felt the airplane tugging to the right side and decided to abort the takeoff. The pilot began to pull the power back to idle and apply braking, while leaving the flaps extended. As she applied the brakes, the airplane pulled to the right, which felt to the pilot like the right brake was locked. The pilot removed her feet from the brakes evenly and the airplane turned quickly to the right. She attempted to correct with left rudder inputs; however, the airplane collided with a sign and sustained substantial damage to the right wing.

Further examination of the condition lever revealed that the condition lever\u2019s outer cable had been improperly installed, which allowed the uncommanded aft movement of the condition lever, which could result in a loss of engine power.  A broken engine mount, which was likely the result of impact-related forces, was also found. This broken engine mount resulted in a slight turbine misalignment. When the turbine was realigned, the FCU condition lever settings were normal. The engine was subsequently started and operated normally with no irregular noises or hesitation.

Delta Air Lines maintenance personnel were conducting a trim run on the No. 2 (right) engine.  After they had checked the No. 2 engine's power, they advanced the No. 1 engine's throttle to check its power when at about 1.7 EPR [engine pressure ratio], they heard a boom and felt a vibration.  They shut down the engines and upon exiting the airplane, noticed the No. 1 engine's fan blades were damaged.  One 1st stage fan blade was completely missing from the front compressor front hub's blade slot.  Several pieces of the missing 1st stage fan blade were recovered from the engine's fan duct.  The metallurgical examination of the fan blade pieces revealed a fatigue fracture on the blade's suction-side blade root bedding flank.  In addition, there were fatigue fractures on the fractured fan blade's suction-side midspan shroud from the upper and lower surfaces of the shroud.  A dimensional inspection of the fractured fan blade's leading edge revealed the radius was 0.035 inch in comparison to the required 0.009 inch.  According to P&W;, the leading edges of the 1st stage fan blades erode during normal operation.  However, P&W; also advised that the amount of wear observed on the separated blade would be associated with approximately 11,000 flight cycles rather than the engine's 2,685 flight cycles since the last overhaul, during which the 1st stage fan blades were overhauled.  According to P&W;, a worn and blunt leading edge can cause a flutter mode that can lead to increased stresses in the fan blade and cause fatigue fractures in the root and airfoil.

The tower personnel confirmed that the gear appeared down. On crosswind, the aircraft descended and struck a fence.  The pilot said the engine began sputtering when he initiated the climb.  Witnesses, including another pilot in the traffic pattern, reported seeing the aircraft in a nose high attitude with the wings oscillating before the aircraft entered a stall and descended behind buildings.  The pilot was in the left seat for the flight.  A Statement of Demonstrated Ability was issued on March 17, 1987, for a right arm amputation from the shoulder down on the basis of a special medical flight test in a non-complex Piper PA28-180.  The FAA inspector who conducted the flight test issued a student pilot certificate with several limitations, which were not transferred to his subsequent temporary and permanent pilot certificates as required by pertinent FAA Orders.  The certificated flight instructor (CFI) who flew with the pilot just before this flight noted that he had many difficulties in controlling the aircraft and working the trim, adjusting the power settings, operating the gear controls, talking on the radio, and moving the flap control handle.  In any of those operations, the pilot had to hold the yoke with his knees and reach across his body.  The CFI said the pilot needed more work and did not endorse him for high performance aircraft.  Post-accident examination of the aircraft revealed no evidence of failure or malfunction with the flight controls or engine.  Fuel system continuity was established.  A measured 2.5 gallons were drained from the left wing tank and 1.5 gallons from the right wing tank (unusable fuel in each tank is 1-gallon).  A screw that attaches to the bus was found to be missing from the landing gear indicator circuit breaker.  The system had been worked on by a maintenance facility just before the flight.

He unsuccessfully re-cycled the gear twice, and then deactivated the landing gear system in order to prevent porting of hydraulic fluid. Prior to landing, the pilot lowered the gear and insured that all of the landing gear green (down and locked) lights were illuminated, and that the gear in-transit light was extinguished. Although the touchdown and initial part of the landing roll were uneventful, as the aircraft decelerated to about 55 knots, the right main gear slowly collapsed. A post-accident inspection of the right main gear determined that the roll pin that holds the forward gear pivot pin in its slot in the gear trunnion had fractured, allowing the pivot pin to work its way loose over time, and ultimately resulting in a misaligned gear trunnion that jammed during the retract cycle. The jamming during the attempted retraction exacerbated the misalignment, and that, along with the looseness of the pivot pin, created a situation where a low load force was able to cause the gear to collapse during the landing roll. An inspection of the pin by the NTSB metallurgical laboratory revealed that there was no evidence of fatigue along the fracture surface, and that the fracture features were consistent with overstress. The investigation revealed no evidence of unusual wear or damage in the area of the pivot pin or its phenolic bearing, nor was there a record of any recent event that would have exposed the gear pivot mechanism to an overload situation.

The high pressure centrifugal impeller disk had burst, with one chunk exiting through the engine cowling.  The melt and forging records for the disk were reviewed and met the required specifications, including alloy chemistry.  Metallurgical examination of the disk revealed subsurface primary and secondary fatigue cracks near an area that had been reworked to remove LCF stresses in accordance with a Service Bulletin.  The cracks were located opposite of each other in the seal relief undercut area.  The primary fatigue origin was below the shot-peened surface near a high stress area and the secondary fatigue origin remained subsurface, with the propagation of both cracks running parallel to the surface until overload separation.  The primary fracture surface could not be definitively analyzed due to plasticity and the presence of an oxide layer.  No melt, forging-related or heat-treating defects were found in the vicinity of the fatigue origins; however, subsurface LCF was present.  No significant hardness difference was found either in or away from the fatigue origins.  There was no evidence of a subsurface occlusion.  A physical resemblance between the fatigue origin and the zones of crystallographically aligned phase (texture zones) was observed in the microstructure.  The shape and orientation of the origin macrostructure and/or texture may have been a contributing factor to crack initiation; however, no precipitating event or cause for the fatigue initiation was identified.  Analysis reverified the Service Bulletin rework specifications, confirming that residual stress was negligible at the depth of crack initiation. ",
