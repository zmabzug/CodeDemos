A few minutes later, the engine's rpm dropped 200-300 rpm.  The 67-hour pilot increased throttle to check for an rpm response.  Subsequently, the engine lost power, and a forced landing was initiated.  While approaching to land, the pilot noticed trees in front of the airplanes flight path and started looking for another place to land, but couldn't see anything because it was too dark.  Subsequently, the aircraft impacted tress coming to rest upright.  An examination of the engine under the supervision of an FAA inspector, revealed the left magneto's internal gears did not rotate with the engine.  Removal of the left magneto revealed only one of two rubber drive isolators inside the ignition harness cap.    Internal inspection revealed the contact points on the left hand side of the magneto did not open on rotation.  Further examination of the airplane, displayed the ignition key turned to the left magneto only.  The pilot reported to the NTSB investigator-in-charge, that he did not touch any switch while exiting the aircraft.",

At 1433:33 the controller cleared the pilot of the Cessna 310 to land on runway 7. Previously, the pilot of the Beech A-36 (N51ML) had requested from, and had been cleared by the Palm Beach Arrival Radar North Controller, to execute the global positioning system (GPS) instrument approach to runway 12 at Stuart, and the procedure had been coordinated with the local tower controllers at Stuart. Shortly thereafter however, the initial Palm Beach Approach controller was relieved, and the relieving approach controller issued the pilot of the Beech A-36 a visual approach clearance to Stuart, along with a radio frequency communications handoff to the Stuart (local) tower controller, which the pilot of the Beech A-36 accepted. However, no follow-up coordination had been conducted between the Palm Beach Approach controllers and the local tower controllers to advise that the Beech A-36 was no longer executing the GPS approach to runway 12. Meanwhile, the Beech A-36 was proceeding inbound to Stuart, from its present position, lining up with runway 7. During the same time period, in response to an inquiry, the local controller had become engaged in a conversation about operations near the airport, and the conversation, interspersed with other air traffic control instructions, limited communications contact, while the Cessna 310 and the Beech A-36 were proceeding inbound to the airport. At 1433:58 the pilot of Beech A-36 informed the local tower controller that he was on a 2 mile final for runway 7, and the local tower controller responded that the Beech A-36 had been expected to execute the GPS approach to runway 12. Shortly thereafter, the Cessna 310 and Beech A-36 collided with each other, in flight, in the traffic pattern, while both were approaching to land on runway 07 at Stuart. During the collision Cessna 310 incurred minor damage, but the pilot continued the approach, and landed safely at Stuart. After the collision, the pilot of Beech A-36 terminated the approach and proceeded to North County Airport, where he landed without further incident. Examination of Beech revealed that the left wing spar had been bent. ",

Contributing to the accident were: 1) inadequate approach/departure control service by ATC approach/departure personnel, and the failure of the radar approach controller to advise the local tower controller of the change in approach procedure for N51ML; 2) the excessive and extraneous radio communications by the local controller which prevented both pilots from providing timely position information during the critical period prior to the midair collision.

The pilot said that during the takeoff roll, he put the yoke full forward, planning to return it to neutral when the tail lifted. He said that when the tail came up, he could not move the yoke aft to neutral, and the aircraft went nose down and nosed over. Examination of the aircraft following the accident revealed no discrepancies in the flight control system. According to the manufacturer, if the stabilizer trim is in the takeoff range, the aircraft is incapable of rotating to that degree of nose down attitude during the takeoff roll. Also, the manufacturer reported that if the trim is nose down, out of the takeoff range, the aircraft will nose down, and it is difficult to move the yoke aft.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.According to the pilot, the airplane took off with a flaps setting of 25 percent, per the operator\u2019s procedures at the time. He stated that, immediately after raising the landing gear after takeoff, he heard an explosion and saw that all gauges for the left engine, a Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC;) PT6A-34, pointed to zero, indicating a loss of power to the left engine. He also noted that the left propeller had completely stopped so he added full power to the right engine, left the flaps at 25 percent, and left the landing gear up. He further stated that, although he \u201cstood on the right rudder,\u201d he could not stop the airplane\u2019s left turning descent. The pilot later noted that, after the left engine lost power, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t hold V speeds\u201d and \u201cthe stall warning horn was going off the whole time.\u201dPostaccident examination of the accident airplane\u2019s left engine revealed that that it had failed and that the propeller had been feathered. Examination of the trim positions revealed that the rudder was at neutral trim and the aileron was at full left trim. Although these trim positions could have been altered when the wings separated from the fuselage during ground impact, the pilot\u2019s comment that he \u201cstood on the rudder\u201d suggests that he either had not trimmed the airplane after the engine failure or had applied trim opposite the desired direction. The activation of the stall warning horn and the pilot\u2019s statement that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t hold V speeds\u201d indicate that he also did not lower the nose sufficiently to maintain best single-engine rate of climb or best single-engine angle of climb airspeed. In addition, a performance calculation conducted during the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s investigation revealed that the airplane, with flaps set at 25 degrees, would have been able to climb at more than 400 feet per minute if the pilot had maintained best single-engine rate of climb airspeed and if the airplane had been properly trimmed.Postaccident examination of the accident airplane\u2019s left engine revealed fatigue fracturing of the first-stage sun gear.[1] According to the airplane\u2019s maintenance records, during an October 1998 engine overhaul, the first-stage planet gear assembly was replaced due to \u201cfrosted and pitted gear teeth.\u201d The planet gear assembly\u2019s mating sun gear was also examined during overhaul but was found to be serviceable and was reinstalled with the new planet gear assembly, which was an accepted practice at the time. However, since then, the engine manufacturer determined that if either the sun gear or planet gear assembly needed to be replaced with a zero-time component, the corresponding mating gear/assembly must also be replaced with a zero-time component; otherwise, the different wear patterns on the gears could potentially cause \u201cdistress\u201d to one or both of the components.Review of maintenance records showed that the engines were maintained, in part, under a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved \u201con-condition\u201d maintenance program;[2] Business Air\u2019s maintenance program was approved in May 1995. In April 2002, P&WC;, the engine manufacturer, issued Service Bulletin (SB) 1403 Revision 7, which no longer mentioned on-condition maintenance programs and required, for the first time for other time between overhaul extension options, the replacement of a number of PT6A-34, -35, and -36 life-limited engine components, including the first-stage sun gear at 12,000 hours total time since new. The first-stage sun gear on the accident airplane failed at 22,064.8 hours.In November 2005 (when the Manchester accident occurred), Business Air was operating under an engine on-condition maintenance program that did not incorporate the up-to-date PT6A 34, -35, and -36 reliability standards for the life-limited parts listed in SB 1403R7 because the SB did not address previously approved on-condition maintenance programs. Three months later, in an e-mail message to Business Air, P&WC; stated that it would continue to \u201cendorse\u201d Business Air\u2019s engine on-condition maintenance program. Although SB 1403R7 improves PT6A-34, -35, and -36 engine reliability standards, allowing grandfathered on-condition maintenance programs for these engines is less restrictive and does not offer the same level of reliability.The National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s review of maintenance records further revealed numerous deficiencies in Business Air\u2019s on-condition engine maintenance program that appear to have gone undetected by the Portland, Maine, Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), which is in charge of monitoring Business Air\u2019s operations. For example, one infraction was that Business Air did not specify which parts were included in its on-condition maintenance program and which would have been removed by other means, such as hard-time scheduling.[3] Also, the operator used engine condition trend monitoring as part of determining engine health; however, review of records revealed missing data, inaccurate data input, a lack of regular trend analyses, and a failure to update trends or reestablish baselines when certain maintenance was performed. Another example showed that, although Business Air had an engine-oil analysis program in place, the time it took to send samples for testing and receive results was lengthy. According to maintenance records, the operator took an oil sample from the accident engine more than 2 weeks before the accident and sent it for testing. The oil sample, which revealed increased iron levels, would have provided valuable information about the engine\u2019s health. However, the results, which indicated a decline in engine health, were not received until days after the accident.If the FAA had been properly monitoring Business Air\u2019s maintenance program, it may have been aware of the operator\u2019s inadequate maintenance practices that allowed, among other things, an engine with a sun gear well beyond what the manufacturer considered to be a reliable operating timeframe to continue operation. It also took more than 2 1/2 years after the accident for the FAA to finally present a consent order[4] to the operator, in which both parties not only acknowledged the operator\u2019s ongoing maintenance inadequacies but also the required corrective actions.[1] A sun gear is the center gear around which an engine\u2019s planet gear assembly revolves; together, the sun gear and planet gear assembly provide a means of reducing the engine\u2019s rpm to the propeller\u2019s rpm.[2] According to FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 120-17A, \u201cMaintenance Control by Reliability Methods,\u201d under on-condition maintenance programs, components are required to be periodically inspected or checked against some appropriate physical standard to determine whether they can continue in service.[3] According to FAA AC 120-17A, \u201cMaintenance Control by Reliability Methods,\u201d under hard-time maintenance programs, components are required to be periodically overhauled or be removed from service.[4] A consent order is a voluntary agreement worked out between two or more parties to a dispute. It generally has the same effect as a court order and can be enforced by the court if anyone does not comply with the orders.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s misapplication of flight controls following an engine failure. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the sun gear, which resulted in the loss of engine power. Contributing to the sun gear failure were the engine manufacturer\u2019s grandfathering of previously recommended, but less reliable, maintenance standards, the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) acceptance of the engine manufacturer\u2019s grandfathering, the operator\u2019s inadequate maintenance practices, and the FAA\u2019s inadequate oversight of the operator."

Witnesses saw the airplane make what appeared to be a normal takeoff, lifting off about halfway down the 4,073-foot runway. It then rolled steeply to the left and the nose fell through the horizon. The airplane struck the ground, exploded, and burned. Based on pictures and wreckage proximity to the runway, the pilot's HA-200 flight instructor said he doubted the airplane could have climbed more than 200-300 feet, and speed would have been no more than 130-140 knots. According to his flight instructor, this speed would allow for shallow turns. If, however, the airplane were to make a steep bank, as witnesses described, a 180-knot airspeed would be required to sustain a 60-degree bank. If the airplane stalled, it would always roll towards the low wing. With its \"almost perfect c.g. (center of gravity),\" the airplane would recover from an accelerated stall after the pilot unloaded the wings. The instructor said the pilot \"flew well, flew safe, and had a good command authority for his new jet. I was impressed with his command ability and attention to detail.\" He was \"above average...an aggressive pilot in command, [who] knew the aircraft systems well.\" Around the fifth hour of instruction, the pilot expressed his desire to do some aerobatics.

The instructor said that during the maneuver, the pilot lost 6,000 feet and rolled out 70 degrees off heading. The instructor then demonstrated a Cuban-8. The lesson ended by the instructor advising the pilot not to perform aerobatics in the HA-200. He suggested that he take basic aerobatic instruction in a slower, more forgiving airplane.

The other witness stated the engine was making a loud popping sound as if it was misfiring. The airplane continued down the runway and eventually became airborne. Additional witnesses reported the airplane was between 50 to 100 feet above the ground when it passed-by the fixed base operator which was about \u00bc the way down the 5,100 foot long runway. These witnesses also described the sound of the engine as \"popping\", \"misfiring\", and as if there were ball bearings inside the engine. They stated the nose of the airplane lowered slightly and they thought the pilot was going to land the airplane back on the runway, but the nose then rose and the airplane continued climbing. The witnesses stated the airplane was slow and \"wallowing\" with the nose pitching up and down slightly as it continued to climb to a maximum altitude of about 100 to 150 feet above the ground. Witnesses at the north end of the airport stated they did not hear the engine as the airplane turned to the south. However, they were not certain if it was because the engine power had decreased or because of their distance and position from the airplane. A witness who was in a parking lot just south of the airport, stated he saw the airplane as it was climbing from the airport. He stated the airplane was about treetop level, less than 100 feet above the ground. The witness stated he did not see smoke or hear any popping or backfiring. He did state that the engine sounded like it was at an idle or a low power setting. The nose of the airplane was slightly up, and the wings were level. He looked toward another airplane in the area and when he looked back, the airplane had disappeared behind the trees.",

Post-accident examination of the wreckage did not reveal any anomalies with the airframe, engine, or propeller that would have affected the aircraft's performance.  Toxicology tests detected 0.037 ug/ml of diphenhydramine in the pilot's blood and an unquantified amount of diphenhydramine in his urine.  Diphenhydramine (commonly known by the trade name Benadryl) is an over-the-counter antihistamine used in symptomatic management of allergic symptoms and also for its sedative, antitussive and antispasmodic effects.  The American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine conducted a study (Effects of Fexofenadine, Diphenhydramine, and Alcohol on Driving Performance) on the effects of diphenhydramine on driving performance.  The results of that study indicated that \"Participants had significantly better coherence after taking alcohol or fexofenadine (Allegra) than after taking diphenhydramine...After participants took diphenhydramine, driving performance was poorest, indicating that diphenhydramine had a greater impact on driving than alcohol did.\"",

He did add 1 quart of oil to the engine.  The flight departed from runway 32 and while climbing between 2,500 and 2,800 feet, the cockpit was enveloped suddenly in thick black smoke.  Additionally, he observed flames underneath the instrument panel behind the rudder pedals on both sides of the cockpit.  He turned off the master switch and initiated a descending left turn with the intention of ditching the airplane.  He reduced the mixture control and opened the cabin entry door in anticipation of ditching but he was able to see outside and elected to return to the airport for landing.  He momentarily turned on the master switch and lowered the landing gear; he landed on runway 14.  After touchdown, the airplane exited the north side of the runway onto grass where he evacuated the airplane by the cabin entry door.  A fire department was not located at the airport.  A nearby fire department was alerted at 1101:34, arrived at 1107:09, and extinguished the fire.  Examination of the airplane by an FAA Airworthiness inspector-in-charge (FAA-IIC) revealed fire consumed the upper and side fuselage skin of the cockpit and cabin area, and damaged the inboard portion of the right wing including consumption of the area of the right fuel tank.  The tailpipe assembly (tailpipe) was found separated from the turbocharger exhaust turbine housing (turbocharger); the coupling used to secure the tailpipe to the turbocharger was found resting on the tailpipe but not in the normally installed position.  No safety wire was observed in the coupling; the nut was not recovered.  There was no mention of damage to either of the flanges of the tailpipe or of the turbocharger.  Additionally, examination of other components of the exhaust system by the FAA-IIC revealed evidence of deterioration that should have been detected during the previous inspection 1.8 hours earlier.  Burn damage was noted to plastic tubing in the cockpit forward of the rudder pedals; the tubing was associated with the brake system.  Examination of the firewall and cockpit by the NTSB revealed no evidence of burn through or compromise of the firewall.  Visual examination of the recovered coupling by the NTSB revealed no damage to the threads.  The coupling was determined to be manufactured by Aeroquip as part number (55677-340M), which is specified in the Illustrated Parts Catalog.  Review of the Aircraft Log revealed an entry dated November 12, 1990, which indicates replacement of the coupling in accordance with Mooney Special Letter 90-6, dated November 1, 1990.

An entry dated March 14, 2001, indicates the exhaust stack was repaired; the entry does not specify what exhaust stack was repaired.  An entry dated April 25, 2001, indicates the engine was removed from the airplane for repair.

The entry does not specify if a new coupling was installed to connect the tailpipe to the turbocharger.  No other entries related to the exhaust system were noted between that entry and the last annual inspection which occurred on February 13, 2003; the inspection was accomplished using the Mooney Service Guide.  The airplane had accumulated approximately 1.8 hours since the inspection at the time of the accident.  The mechanic who performed the last annual/100-Hour inspection reported to the FAA-IIC that during the inspection, he removed the turbocharger wastegate for cleaning and also removed the tailpipe.  He reported reinstalling the tailpipe using the same nut.  Review of the Mooney Aircraft Corporation Service and Maintenance Manual pertaining to the 100-Hour or Annual inspection revealed the exhaust system components are inspected for security.  When the airplane was certificated, there was no requirement to protect components aft of the firewall from radiant heat.",
            "probable_cause": "The inadequate annual/100-hour inspection of the engine by the mechanic for his failure to properly secure the tailpipe assembly to the turbocharger resulting in separation of the tailpipe and subsequent in-flight fire.  Contributing factors in the accident were the inadequate design of the plastic brake line in the cockpit adjacent to the firewall by the airplane manufacturer, and the inadequate certification of the airplane by the FAA for failure to take into account radiant heat when designing components aft of the firewall."

The pilot reduced power, slowed the airplane and stalled the propeller, which reduced the vibrations.  He then declared an emergency and made a forced landing to a field.  Examination of the airplane revealed that approximately 44-inches of one of the Sensenich fixed-pitch (all metal) propeller blades had separated and was not recovered.  The other blade was intact.  The top and bottom engine mounts on the right side (as viewed from the cockpit) were severed and the engine was displaced down and to the right.  A materials examination of the propeller's fractured surface revealed fatigue cracking through approximately 85 percent of the blade and corrosion pitting at the initiation point of the failure. The remaining portion of the fracture was more jagged, had a matte appearance, and was oriented at a slant angle, which was indicative of a final overstress fracture region.  A review of Sensenich's records revealed that in April 1991, this propeller (which was original to the airplane) was sent to Sensenich to be reworked; however, it was rejected due to the fact that it was \"out of material chord at the tip.\"  The propeller was returned, and at some point was placed back on the airplane.

The pilot and a mechanic were to fly a maintenance flight check of the engine and perform a rotor track and balance. He entered a descent at approximately 1,200 feet above ground level (agl) and prepared to level off at approximately 700 feet agl. When he tried to pull up on the collective, the collective would not move and was observed latched by the collective down lock. He and the mechanic tried to unlatch the collective from the down lock, but they did not have enough time before he had to flare the helicopter for landing. With the collective stuck in flat pitch, they landed hard and with forward speed. The flight crew evacuated the helicopter once it had come to rest. An ensuing post accident fire destroyed the helicopter. A new after market avionics control panel had been installed and the collective down lock, which is secured to the panel, was adjusted prior to the flight. The down lock attaches to the lower section of avionics panel. When the collective is lowered to the lower pitch stop the clearance between the collective and the down lock is about 0.16 inches. The down lock is a flexible plate that is free to vibrate with the helicopter's normal rhythms. In the original factory installation, the clearance between the down lock and the collective is 0.3 inches.

Examination of the accident aircraft\u2019s locking plate indicated that the locking plate bend was likely reversed, allowing the locking plate to spring toward the lock button.",
            "probable_cause": "Inadvertent in-flight engagement of the collective down lock, which resulted in an uncontrolled descent and ground impact. The collective down lock engagement was caused by the improper installation and/or adjustment of the collective locking system, which reduced the clearance between the locking plate and the collective control. A factor was the pilot\u2019s decision to embark on a maintenance test flight after encountering difficulty disengaging the collective lock release during previous hover tests."

The private pilot and pilot-rated-passenger were not injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight test that originally departed EFD about 1400.The pilot reported that the accident occurred during the airplane's second flight since receiving its experimental airworthiness certificate on July 1, 2014, and that it was still operating under the restrictions of the initial flight test phase. The pilot stated that the airplane's maiden flight was completed earlier in the day and was flown by another pilot. He stated that the accident occurred during his first flight in the airplane and that he was being assisted by the pilot who had completed the earlier flight. The purpose of the second flight test was to complete basic flight maneuvers, verify/calibrate cockpit instrumentation, and to perform several takeoff-and-landings at the nearby RWJ Airpark (54T), Baytown, Texas, before returning to EFD. The pilot reported that during his final landing at 54T, the engine, while at an idle power setting, experienced a total loss of power during landing roll. The pilot was able to restart the engine and subsequently departed 54T for the return flight to EFD. Shortly after the pilot had established communications with EFT air traffic control tower, the airplane experienced another total loss of engine power about 3 miles east of the airport. The airplane did not have sufficient altitude remaining to glide to EFD, and as such, the pilot performed a forced landing to a nearby vacant field. The left main landing gear and nose landing gear collapsed during landing roll, which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing primary structure and the forward fuselage structure.At 1450, the EFD automated surface observing system (ASOS) reported: wind 120 degrees at 6 knots, visibility 10 miles, scattered clouds at 4,000 feet above ground level, temperature 32 degrees Celsius; dew point 23 degrees Celsius; and an altimeter setting of 29.95 inches of mercury.",

At touchdown, the left landing skid collapsed, and the helicopter subsequently came to rest in a forward-pitch attitude. Postaccident examination of the landing skid revealed that the skid clamp that connects the forward cross tube to the landing gear skid had failed due to fatigue cracking that had initiated in the heat-affected zone adjacent to a weld. The fatigue cracks then propagated inward through the clamp. After the clamp fractured, the bolt hole ring that connected the clamp to the fuselage frame failed in overstress, which caused the landing gear skid to fail. Hardness testing revealed that the weld material, clamp, and ring, significantly differed in hardness. Materials joined with a broad hardness gradient are likely to contain high residual stresses, which in this case, would have been concentrated at the boundary between the clamp and the weld and led to a failure of the weld when the landing load was applied. Because multiple crack initiation sites were found in areas without material defects, the fatigue crack that led to the leg failure probably developed and propagated over a long time under numerous low-stress cycles. The airplane manufacturer placed no life or event limits (hard landing) for replacing landing gear skid tube clamps; it only required periodic visual inspections of the skid tube clamps, which was not adequate for detection of the fatigue cracking because the weld cracks were not visible and could only have been detected by magnetic particle or dye penetrant inspection. \u000b\u000b\u000b\u000b\u000b\u000b",

The airplane was operated as a VFR, on-demand air taxi flight to the Denali National Park base camp, located at 7,200 feet msl on the Kahiltna glacier.  The base camp is where the three rangers were to begin mountain patrol operations on Mt. McKinley, Alaska.  Variable weather conditions with low ceilings near the base camp made landing at the base camp problematic throughout the day.  When the pilot departed for the base camp, he opened a VFR flight plan, and was advised that an AIRMET for mountain obscuration and turbulence were current for the area.  About 45 minutes after departure, the pilot talked via radio to another airplane pilot at the Kahiltna base camp, who advised the upper portion of the glacier was closed due to low clouds.  The accident pilot commented that the weather had closed the lower portion of the glacier, and he was diverting toward the west, toward another glacier drainage.  A ranger on-board the accident airplane contacted his ranger station by a hand-held radio and stated the flight was returning.  The accident airplane did not return to its base, and was reported overdue.  The wreckage was located the following day, scattered over about 1/2 mile.  Evidence indicated the airplane broke apart in-flight.  The left wing, left wing lift strut, the left landing gear strut, the left door and windshield, were located on the upper portion of a steep hillside.  The engine struck the ground below the left wing, separating the propeller, and then tumbled downhill.  The fuselage came to rest about 1/4 mile below the left wing, and was consumed by a postcrash fire. The airplane's wing spars, and each horizontal stabilizer had all negative bending signatures.  The flap handle was found extended to 20 degrees.  The airplane manufacturer does not publish any negative structural load factors for a flaps down configuration.  A review of meteorological data revealed an occluded front with convective activity that progressed northward toward the accident area, accompanied by heavy rain and hail.  The front was positioned near the accident area when the airplane was diverting away from the mountain.  The pilot was the chief pilot for the operator.

Approximately 42 nautical miles off Freeport, he began an initial descent to 4,500 feet, then 3,500 feet. When the pilot applied throttle following the descent, there was no engine response. The engine remained at idle and the pilot ditched the airplane near a commercial boat. All four occupants were rescued without injuries.

During that flight, he noticed that the right auxiliary fuel gauge was inoperative. The airplane landed uneventfully and remained in a hangar until the accident flight. The purpose of the accident flight was to drain fuel from the right auxiliary fuel tank, in order for maintenance work to be performed on the fuel tank sending unit. The pilot did not check the fuel quantity prior to the accident flight as he estimated that sufficient fuel remained from the previous flight. The pilot completed a 20-minute local flight and was on final approach to land, with the fuel selector positioned to the right auxiliary fuel tank, when a low fuel pressure indicator light illuminated in the cockpit. At that time, the airplane was about 800 feet above ground level, over a populated town. The pilot activated the fuel boost pump, but did not reposition the fuel selector to a different fuel tank. The engine subsequently experienced a total loss of power and the pilot performed a forced landing into trees and a river.

The pilot and passenger were uninjured. The airplane was registered to, and operated by, the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was on file. The flight originated at the Juneau International Airport, destined for the Hoonah Airport, Hoonah, Alaska, but it returned to the Juneau International Airport for the emergency landing.   During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge on July 11, the pilot stated that while approaching the Hoonah Airport, the flaps were set to 20 degrees down, and the landing gear handle was selected to the down position. He said that the nose wheel fully extended and locked into place, but the left and right main landing gear extended about halfway and stopped. The landing gear selector was then placed back into the up position in an effort to cycle the landing gear. The pilot said he could hear the hydraulic pump cycling, but the landing gear failed to move. The landing gear selector was placed again in the down position and in the interest of safety; he decided to change the destination from the Hoonah Airport to the Juneau Airport where there was Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) equipment and personnel could be standing by. He estimates that during the flight from Hoonah to Juneau, he pumped the landing gear emergency hand pump hundreds of times, but he never felt any resistance in the hydraulic lines, and the main landing gear remained only partially extended.  The pilot said that he elected to land on runway 8, at the Juneau International Airport, which is an 8,857 feet long by 150 feet wide paved runway, with the nose wheel in the down and locked position. During touchdown, the airplane veered to the left, and it subsequently went off the left side of the runway, sustaining substantial damage to the fuselage and left horizontal stabilizer.  During removal of the airplane from the runway, it was lifted with a crane so the landing gear could be physically pulled into place and secured with pins to prevent retraction. When the airplane was lifted and positioned in a level attitude, hydraulic fluid was observed leaking from the bottom of the airplane.The closest weather reporting facility is Juneau Airport. At 1553, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) from the Juneau Airport was reporting in part: wind from 120 degrees at 11 knots; sky condition, few at 500 feet above ground level (agl), broken at 2,700 feet agl, overcast at 5,500 feet agl; visibility, 10 statute miles; light rain; temperature 60 degrees F; dewpoint 55 degrees F; barometric pressure 29.72inHG. The airplane was equipped with a Continental Motors IO-470 series engine. A detailed wreckage examination is pending.",

The coupling was properly safetied, but the B-nut was cocked on the fitting, and 3-4 fitting threads were exposed below the B-nut, consistent with the B-nut being cross-threaded on the fitting during installation. The HPTACC valve fuel rod tube coupling has both primary (metal-to-metal) and secondary (O-ring) seals between the fitting and the tube ferrule. Pre-disassembly X-ray photographs of the coupling provided B-nut stack measurements and showed a gap between the fitting and the ferrule at the primary seal location, indicating that this seal had not been engaged when the B-nut was tightened on the fitting. Disassembly inspection of the coupling found that the O-ring (secondary) seal was radially separated and extruded from its gland, consistent with having failed in service. A high-torque B-nut connection and thread damage to the B-nut and fitting threads were further evidence of an improperly installed (cross-threaded) B-nut. Maintenance and manufacturing records indicated that the coupling had not been disassembled since the engine was assembled at manufacture. An extrusion calculation found that the damage to the O-ring seal was consistent with the engine total time since new.

The captain reported that he did not clear the ground deicing crew to start their deicing operations. The driver of the primary deicing vehicle reported that he informed the flight crew of the fluid types, freeze points, and concentrations. He added that there was a lot of \"radio chatter\" and the bucket operator began deicing operations \"after we received no objections\" from the flight crew. Company deicing procedures state, in part, \"prior to fluid application, Ground Deicing Crew member shall confirm with Flight Crew that the aircraft is configured for deicing.\" The flight crew gate deicing checklist states that the APU and engine bleed air switches are to be turned off prior to deicing. At the time, the APU and engine bleed air switches were still in the ON position when deicing fluid was sprayed on the airplane. This allowed the fluid to be introduced into the air supply lines leading to the cabin and cockpit.",

The aircraft's DO/VERIFY checklist was then verified after all pre-takeoff items had been completed.  He then set the rotor rpm switch to the 102% position, pulled enough collective to bring the helicopter to a hover, and then verified 102% rpm before pulling collective for takeoff power and adding forward cyclic to start the climb-out.  As the aircraft started its forward motion the pilot heard \"ROTOR LOW\" in his headset as the helicopter began to settle.

A post-accident examination conducted by an FAA inspector shortly after the accident revealed that both engine control switches were in the OFF position.  Testing of various components and both engines failed to reveal any anomalies which would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.  Data from the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) revealed that the number 1 engine was producing normal and abnormally high torque values during the takeoff sequence, while a zero torque value but proper Ng values were observed from data on the number 2 engine during takeoff; this is consistent with the number 2 engine control switch remaining in the IDLE position.

            "narrative": "On July 24, 2015, at 1731 eastern daylight time, a Piper J3C-65, N92653, was substantially damaged during a forced landing to the Kanawha Valley Dragway race track in Southside, West Virginia, following a total loss of engine power. The commercial pilot/owner sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight which departed Cambridge Municipal Airport (CDI), Cambridge, Ohio, about 1500. The pilot originally reported his destination on this leg of a multi-leg flight to Florida was Ashland, Kentucky DWU), and then later stated his destination was Ona, West Virginia (12V). The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, the airplane was in cruise flight about 1,000 feet above ground level when the engine stopped producing power. He selected the drag strip for the forced landing, and during the descent, the engine restarted briefly, and then stopped for the remainder of the descent. During the landing flare, the engine surged to \"cruise power\" before the airplane struck a guardrail, nosed over, and came to rest inverted. The pilot stated fuel was \"pouring\" from the airplane after it came to rest.The pilot further stated that he did not secure the engine during the descent, as he was preoccupied with reaching his forced landing area.The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane multiengine land, single-engine land, single-engine sea, and instrument airplane. He held a flight instructor certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine and instrument airplane, and a ground instructor certificate with ratings for basic and instrument. The pilot also held a Control Tower Operator Certificate with limits for Akron-Canton Air Traffic Control Tower, North Canton, Ohio. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-class medical certificate was issued December 31, 2014. The pilot reported 1,927 total hours of flight experience, of which 180 hours were in the accident airplane make and model.The airplane was manufactured in 1945, and was equipped with a Continental A&C65; series 65-horsepower engine and a 12-gallon fuel tank. The airplane was not equipped with an electrical system. The magnetos were excited by revolution of the crankshaft, and engine start was accomplished by hand-propping. Its most recent annual inspection was completed in May 11, 2015. The owner estimated the airplane had accrued 1,827 total aircraft hours at the time of the accident.FAA inspectors examined the airplane at the accident site on July 27, 2015. Examination of photographs and telephone conversations with the inspectors revealed that both propeller blades of the wood propeller were fractured near the hub and the splinters were broomstrawed and bent opposite the direction of rotation. There was no odor of fuel, no evidence of fuel, no evidence of fuel staining, and no blighting of the grass beneath the airplane due to fuel spillage.The carburetor was separated from the engine due to impact; therefore an engine test run could not be performed at the accident scene. The carburetor and the magnetos were removed for examination and testing in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania on August 6, 2015. Examination of the carburetor revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies. The magnetos were placed on a test bench and each produced spark at operating rpm, and as low as 70 rpm.",

A visual examination revealed a 3 inch by 4 inch tear on the aft right side of the fuselage, and that the tail rotor shaft was fractured.  No tail rotor blade damage was noted.  According to the Boeing representative, the tail rotor drive shaft had a \"rotational/torsion fracture\" near fuselage station 170.0, and exhibited a degree of \"shaft wind-up\" normally associated with a \"sudden stoppage to the tail rotor system.\" According to a metallurgist who examined the fractured tail rotor drive shaft, the fractured surfaces exhibited \"extensive torsional deformation on both sides of the aft fracture.\"  The indicated direction of torsion, as viewed looking aft, was \"as if the forward portion of the shaft rotated clockwise,\" relative to the aft portion of the shaft.  This fracture was largely circumferential and was at a location where the exterior surface of the shaft contained mechanical rubbing and rotational contact damage.  Several other areas of rotational damage were noted on the shaft surface between the forward and aft fractures.  A detailed examination of the fracture surfaces in the shaft revealed clean fractures on a 45-degree slant plane, \"typical of recent overstress fracture under tension or tearing loads.\"  No evidence of preexisting fracture such as fatigue cracking was noted.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's improper in-flight planning and decision making, his failure to maintain terrain clearance, and the total failure of the tail rotor drive shaft as a result of the tail rotor strike."

On the day before the accident, the pilot performed a routine 25-hour oil change and valve adjustment and noted no anomalies. On the day of the accident, the pilot departed a grass airstrip for a local flight with 8 gallons of fuel. He overflew the airstrip once and then performed an approach with the intention to land; however, the airplane was too high, so the pilot performed a go-around. During the go-around, the pilot heard two \u201cpops,\u201d and the engine lost total power. The propeller did not windmill and came to a complete stop. The airplane was at a low altitude, and the pilot chose to land in a cornfield rather than try to turn back to the runway. During the landing, the right main landing gear lodged in mud, and the airplane nosed over. During a test run, the pilot was able to rotate the propeller and get compression on all four cylinders. He then started the engine, and it ran without hesitation. After shutdown, the pilot removed all of the cylinders and did not observe any preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. The weather conditions were conducive to the accumulation of serious carburetor icing at cruise power.

He shut down the right engine as a precautionary measure. He then observed a flame emanating from the right side of the engine, so he pitched the nose of the airplane down, increasing the airspeed and extinguishing the fire almost immediately. He subsequently landed uneventfully. Examination of the right engine revealed that the number 3 cylinder was separated from the engine case, and that the right wing was substantially damaged. Detailed examination of the number 3 cylinder attachment studs revealed that they had failed in fatigue, most likely due to insufficient preload of the fastening nuts. Paint in the nut contact area around one of the cylinder hold down plates was present, and was not disturbed. Adequate friction during the attachment and torquing process would be expected to disturb and remove the paint layer, as was seen at other locations on the hold down plate. Further, the paint observed between the cylinder flange and hold down plate was not the primer specified by the engine manufacturer's overhaul manual, and was applied at a thickness greater than that specified in the manual. The presence of this paint could have lead to an in-service loss of preload, even if sufficient torque was applied to the cylinder nuts at the time of installation. Although logbook records had no entries to show that any of the right engine\u2019s cylinders had been removed or replaced since the last engine overhaul, evidence indicated that the No. 3 cylinder had been replaced after the engine was overhauled. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the cylinders installed during the overhaul were new, and had serial and cylinder class numbers stamped on them. The overhauler stated that new cylinders were received with a thin coat of zinc chromate, and that the engine was painted after reassembly.

The pilot had to perform two go-arounds due to other traffic in the airport traffic pattern. During the third attempt, while on final approach to runway 9, the pilot extended his glidepath due to another aircraft back-taxiing on the 3,415-foot-long turf runway. The pilot intended to land further down the runway; however, the airspeed decreased when he extended the glidepath. There was also a wind shift when the aircraft was about 15 feet above the runway, which caused it to stall and impact the runway. The aircraft subsequently came to rest inverted on the runway. Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to both wings. The inspector did not observe any preimpact mechanical malfunctions, nor did the pilot report any. The pilot added that the wind was variable at 9 knots, gusting to 12 knots. The recorded wind information at an airport located about 17 miles from the accident site was similar, indicating variable wind from 020 to 090 degrees at 8 knots.",
