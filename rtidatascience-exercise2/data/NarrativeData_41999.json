As the accident airplane neared the runway threshold, the air traffic control tower (ATCT) controller instructed the accident pilot to go around because the first airplane was still on the runway. The ATCT controller reported that despite two subsequent requests for the pilot to go around, the pilot did not acknowledge the requests, but the airplane stopped descending, and it continued to fly over the runway. \u000b\u000bMultiple witnesses located at and around the airport reported seeing the accident airplane flying about 100 feet above the runway in a nose-high attitude. As the airplane continued over the departure end of the runway, witnesses reported hearing the engine lose power, which was followed by a steep left turn back toward the airport. During the turn, the airplane\u2019s nose pitched down abruptly, and the airplane collided with the ground in a steep, nose-down attitude near the departure end of the runway.\u000b\u000bThe airplane was equipped with two 19-gallon wing-mounted fuel tanks, of which 1.5 gallons of fuel in each tank is unusable. An on-scene wreckage examination revealed that about 1.8 gallons of fuel was removed from the right wing fuel tank, and about 1 quart of fuel was removed from the left wing fuel tank. Both fuel tanks were intact and not breached. The left wing fuel tank was equipped with a fuel vent line on the forward outboard area of the fuel tank. When comparing the final at-rest attitude of the airframe and wings, it is likely that the fuel within the left wing fuel tank was equivalent to the right wing fuel tank level; however, fuel would have drained from the left wing fuel tank through the vent line, thus resulting in a lower fuel level in the left wing fuel tank at the accident site. A subsequent postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of a mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation.\u000b\u000bGiven the lack of mechanical deficiencies with the airplane, the amount of fuel discovered in the airplane\u2019s fuel tanks, and the witness statements, it is likely that the fuel tank inlets became unported when the airplane entered the nose-high attitude during the go-around, which resulted in fuel starvation. The pilot\u2019s decision to return to the airport by initiating a turn at low altitude and low airspeed following the loss the of engine power resulted in an aerodynamic stall and a loss of control with insufficient altitude to recover.",

ATC cleared the pilot for an ILS approach to runway 35, and the pilot acknowledged the approach clearance.  When the airplane reached the outer marker ATC approved the pilot for a frequency change to the common traffic advisory frequency.  The pilot acknowledged the frequency change, and no further communications were received from the pilot by ATC.  Witnesses observed the observed the airplane approximately 200 feet above ground level (agl) on a northwesterly heading, west of runway 35.  The airplane then entered a climbing left turn to the south and disappeared into the overcast cloud layer.  Shortly thereafter, the witness observed the airplane in a \"20 degree nose down, wings level attitude\" on a southeasterly heading.  The witness then lost sight of the airplane due to hangars obstructing his view.  At the time of the accident, the witness stated that the ceiling was approximately 500 foot overcast with mist.  The published missed approach procedure instructed the pilot to initiate a climbing left turn to a fix and hold.  Examination of the accident site revealed the airplane impacted the terrain in a right wing, nose-low attitude.  No ground impact marks were noted except in the immediate vicinity of the wing leading edges, engines, and propeller assemblies.  The flaps and landing gear were in the extended position.  The leading edge surfaces of the vertical and horizontal stabilizers revealed 1/4 to 1/2 inches of clear ice.  The upper fuselage antenna displayed 1/4 to 1/2 inches of clear ice.

The pilot subsequently made a forced landing, and the airplane impacted the ground, became airborne, crossed a road, and then came to rest short of the intended runway.\u00a0First responders reported that they found the fuel selector valve positioned to the left tank and that they observed fuel leaking from the left wing; however, an exact amount of fuel could not be ascertained. The recovery company reported that the right wing fuel tank contained 17 gallons of fuel and that the left wing fuel tank contained less than 1 gallon of fuel. Postaccident examination revealed no evidence of any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Although blue streaking was observed on the aft portion of the left wing, it could not be determined if the blue streaks were due to fuel leaking during the flight or the accident sequence or before the day of the accident. Examination of the engine revealed carbon deposits on all of the cylinders\u2019 piston faces, which is consistent with operating the engine at too lean of a fuel mixture. Following a normal engine test run, minimal carbon deposits were noted. Although some fuel was in the left wing tank at the time of the accident, it was likely less than the usable amount required, as indicated by the lean fuel mixture at the engine; thus, it is likely that the total loss of engine power was due to fuel starvation.",

The First Officer, who was flying at the time, made a right turn over Elliott Bay and lined up on what he believed to be Runway 16 Right, but was in fact Taxiway Tango. When the aircraft was about one mile from the end of the taxiway, the first officer noticed a yellow X located just off the northern end of the surface he intended to land on. Upon realizing he was lined up on the wrong surface, he initiated a sidestep to Runway 16 Right. He subsequently completed an uneventful landing on Runway 16 Right, and taxied to the gate for a normal deplanement of the passengers. According to recorded radar tracking data, at the time of the turn to initiate the sidestep, the aircraft was approximately 600 feet above the ground (AGL). The size and shape of the taxiway made it look very much like a runway to the First Officer, and although he was eventually able to see the Runway 16 Right identification markings, because of the glare on the wet surfaces, he never did clearly see any markings that indicated Taxiway Tango was a taxiway.

While attempting to land at an airport for a rest stop, the pilot executed a low power, steep approach to the asphalt runway. During the flare for landing, the airplane touched down early, skipped, became airborne, and touched down a second time. The airplane then swerved to the right, and ground looped, substantially damaging the airplane. Examination of the landing gear revealed that the main landing gear wheels were \"toed out\" approximately 2-degrees. The tailwheel steering springs that connected the rudder to the tailwheel were \"small,\" and  the tailwheel  would release to \"full swivel\" at a steering angle less than that required for full rudder deflection. The pilot believed however; that the airplane could have been controlled during the landing if differential braking was used to correct a significant swerve.

The American Champion, registered to the pilot, made a dead stick approach along the edge of an open meadow and struck a tree during the landing, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane. The Cessna, registered to High Plane Flyers, Inc., impacted terrain and was consumed by a post crash fire. The commercial pilot operating the American Champion received minor injuries and the private pilot operating the Cessna received fatal injuries. Both airplanes were operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The American Champion departed McCall Airport at 0715, and the Cessna departed Flying A ranch at 0715. The destination for both airplanes was Sulfur Creek Ranch Airport, Idaho.The pilot of the American Champion stated that she and the Cessna pilot were going to meet at Sulfur Creek Ranch Airport the morning of the accident. After departing McCall she stated that she had a visual on the Cessna as it departed Flying A Ranch. It was below her at the 5 o'clock position. They both were in radio communications with each other. The Cessna pilot stated that his ground speed was 129 knots and she stated that hers was 101 knots. She reported that she was 10 miles west of Sulfur Creek at 7,800 feet, and the Cessna pilot reported that he was 5 miles west of Sulfur Creek, at 6,800 feet. By this time she had lost visual contact with the Cessna and over the radio the Cessna pilot stated that he had passed her. At that point, 10 miles west of Sulfur Creek, the American Champion pilot said that she saw the Cessna appear under her left wing, overtaking her from behind and below. The Cessna appeared to be climbing and she had no time to react before the airplane struck her propeller and then disappeared downward. Her engine stopped, she tested the flight controls, made a mayday radio transmission, then executed a forced landing into an open area.The wreckage of the Cessna was located about 1 mile south of where the American Champion had made its forced landing. The Cessna had been subjected to a post accident fire, and a small debris field consisting of camping equipment, personal bags, right wing lift strut, and right horizontal stabilizer was distributed to the northwest, extending out approximately 700 feet from the main wreckage.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot was performing high speed taxi tests in an experimental category airplane that he had designed and built. The airplane was configured with a T-tail, a canard wing forward of the cockpit with elevator control surfaces, and had two 28-hp engines mounted facing aft along the trailing edge of the wings in a pusher type design. The main landing gear were located forward of the engine nacelles. To address a lack of pitch response experienced during previous tests, the pilot had increased the size of the canard control surfaces, and moved the center of gravity further aft. During the first taxi run the electronic flight information system (EFIS) recorded a maximum pitch of 9 degrees, and maximum airspeed of 67 knots. During the test run that precipitated the accident, the airplane became airborne at the end of the taxi run and rose to about 122 feet above ground level (agl), entered a right-hand turn, stalled, and impacted terrain in a flat attitude. Audible engine sounds could be heard from the airplane throughout the event and the recorded data supported normal engine operation. The last 16 seconds of data recovered from the EFIS corroborated the witness reports, recording the airplane pitching up suddenly from 8 degrees to 45 degrees, the airspeed decaying from 55 to 22 knots, and then entering a rapid vertical descent. A colleague of the pilot stated that in this pusher configured airplane where the propellers are located aft of the main landing gear, a sudden reduction in thrust could cause a pitch up rotation moment around the main landing gear when on the ground. Toxicology testing was consistent with the recent use by the pilot of a medication containing diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter sedating antihistamine that commonly results in impairment; however, the investigation was unable to conclusively determine whether the use of this medication contributed to the accident.",

The two private pilots were fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by ATP Aircraft 2, LLC and was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as an instructional flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed. The airplane had departed from the Concord Regional Airport (JQF), Concord, North Carolina, about 1551 EDT and had an intended destination of Jacksonville Executive Airport at Craig (CRG), Jacksonville, Florida. According to representatives of the flight school, the pilots had flown into JQF earlier from CRG and had an airplane change for the flight back to CRG.According to a witness, the airplane was observed flying in a \"northeasterly direction\" prior to his losing sight of the airplane. Several eyewitnesses reported hearing a \"thud\" or \"explosion\" and also observed debris falling from above.Preliminary radar information indicated that around 1740 the airplane was flying at 8,000 feet when the Federal Aviation Administration Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center instructed the pilots to descend. The command was acknowledged by the pilots; however, no further voice recordings were received from the accident flight. About 1744, the last recorded radar data indicated that the airplane was at 300 feet above ground level and no further data transmissions were received.",

The commercial pilot was fatally injured and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to the pilot and operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight and no flight plan had been filed. The flight originated at Santa Paula Airport and was destined for California City, California.Airplane wreckage was located by California Resources Corporation employee who was working at the South Mountain Booster Plant.  He located the wreckage about 1400 PDT on Saturday, August 1.  A witness reported seeing the airplane takeoff at 0902 from runway 22 at Santa Paula Airport. The airplane disappeared into a 300 foot above ground level (agl) overcast then reemerged, after turning 180 degrees, on a close downwind to the runway. It then departed on the downwind to the east. The wreckage was located on the north side of South Mountain on a 40 degree slope populated with scrub trees at an elevation of 1,223 feet mean sea level (msl). The initial point of impact was the left wingtip identified by wingtip fairing fragments and topped-off small trees/brush next to the main impact ground scar. Contained within the ground scar was the landing gear door. Clipped brush and ground scar evidence is consistent with a level attitude at time of impact. The airplane traveled upslope 20-30 feet beyond the initial impact point, along a 205\u00b0 magnetic bearing direction.The nearest weather reporting station was Camarillo Airport, located about 10 miles southwest of the accident site.  At 0855 the automatic surface observation system (ASOS) recorded calm wind, 5 statute mile visibility in haze, a 700 foot agl overcast, temperature was 21 degrees Celsius, the dew point was 18 degrees Celsius, and the atmospheric pressure was 29.99 inches of mercury. The GOES-15 satellite visible image at 0900 PDT (1600Z) depicts an area of low stratiform clouds and/or fog over the accident site and the departure airport, and generally hugging the California coastal sections.  The San Diego upper air sounding plot supports cloud or stratus layer with tops to only 2,000 feet agl with a defined temperature inversion from 2,000 to 4,000 feet, stable atmosphere and light winds.

The pilot continued his descent and was informed by the controller that the airport was changing to IFR and instructed the pilot to contact approach control.  A low layer of clouds had moved into the area. The pilot contacted the approach controller and asked if he could perform the ILS runway 24 approach. The controller started vectoring the pilot for  a left downwind, and asked the pilot if he was instrument qualified and current. The pilot replied, \"We are IFR qualified,\"  even though he was not. The controller informed the pilot to turn left to a heading and the pilot responded by saying he was turning right The controller again instructed the pilot to turn to the left, expect the ILS runway 24 approach, and to advise that he had the current airport information. The pilot responded by saying he was turning right and that he would pick up the airport information.  The controller informed the pilot that it was not a right turn, and informed the pilot he had turned in the wrong direction on the last turn and to turn to the left. The pilot replied that he was turning to the left to the assigned heading. The controller asked the pilot what his type of airplane was, and the pilot replied, \"Cirrus I had to pull the parachute.\" The pilot stated in an interview with the NTSB that he was struggling to keep the airplane level; he was in instrument conditions, in a black hole without a visible horizon or ambient light, and that he became spatially disoriented and pulled the parachute. Advisory Circular 60-4A states in part, \"The attitude of an aircraft is generally determined by reference to the natural horizon or other visual references with the surface. If neither horizon nor surface references exist, the attitude of an aircraft must be determined by artificial means from the flight instruments. Sight, supported by other senses, allows the pilot to maintain orientation. However; during periods of low visibility, the supporting senses sometimes conflict with what is seen. When this happens, a pilot is particularly vulnerable to disorientation.\" Because of the clouds that had moved into the area, the pilot likely could not distinguish ground cues that would have helped him determine the airplanes attitude. Without an instrument rating, the pilot was unable to use his flight instruments to help him successfully orient and land the airplane. Had the pilot informed the controller that he was not instrument rated, the controller may have been able to  instruct the pilot to climb to visual flight conditions and land at another VFR airport.",

During the preflight for the return trip, the pilot noticed that there was still difficulty steering to the right; however, he elected to take-off and fly the airplane to its home base.  The wheel landing was normal until the airplane slowed to 40 knots, then the airplane suddenly veered to the left about 90 degrees.  The pilot stated that he tried to compensate with right rudder to no avail.  The pilot stated that the tower reported the winds to be from 350 degrees at 6 knots just prior to landing.  According to a certified mechanic and an FAA inspector who examined the airplane, no anomalies were noted with the steering system that would have prevented its normal operation. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll resulting in an inadvertent ground loop. "

The witness further reported that as the airplane approached a stand of trees he observed it pitch up, the wings rocked back and forth from side to side, followed by the airplane descending to the right, in a right wing low, nose down attitude; the witness lost sight of the airplane as it descended behind the stand of trees. Additionally, two other witnesses reported that the airplane's engine did not seem to be producing full power during the takeoff, and that it was side-slipping and losing altitude from about 200 feet agl.

According to eyewitnesses, the airplane was in a left-wing-down attitude when it impacted a tree, power lines, and then another tree before coming to rest in a pasture. A review of data downloaded from the engine data monitor revealed that the rear engine exhibited erratic fuel flow beginning 2 days before the accident and continuing through the accident flight. Further, the engine data monitor indicated that the rear engine\u2019s propeller was under low-to-no power with a low pitch angle at the time of impact. The front engine exhibited no abnormalities or malfunctions, and the investigation found no other anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.During postaccident examination, the engine-driven fuel pump was removed and bench tested where it exhibited fuel flow higher than manufacturer guidelines with low fuel pressure. In order to meet bench test standards, an adjustment equal to three turns of the adjustment screw was made. The fuel pump then operated normally and was placed back on the engine; however, the engine still did not attain full power. Further examination revealed potential debris between the throttle assembly\u2019s brass and stainless steel plates. After removal of the debris and reassembly of the throttle assembly, it operated within the normal range. Although the source of the debris could not be definitively determined, it likely originated in either in the fuel or a fuel tank. Maintenance records indicate that two days before the accident, the fuel pump was removed, repaired, and reinstalled after work was completed on the rear fuel selector valve. After the pump was reinstalled, the mechanic adjusted the continuous flow fuel injection system using the airplane\u2019s JPI engine monitor system and an external low pressure gauge to set the takeoff fuel flow; he then refueled the plane from containers in which he had stored the fuel in order to service the fuel pump. The following day, the pilot and the mechanic again adjusted the fuel pump\u2019s fuel flow after conducting an unsatisfactory engine run-up . After the adjustment, the run-up appeared to be normal. Directives from the engine\u2019s manufacturer recommended using a Model 20 ATM-C Porta Test Unit or equivalent to ensure the fuel injection system meets all pressure and flow specifications. Using a JPI engine monitor and an external gauge would have given inaccurate results without a properly calibrated fuel pump, and the mechanic\u2019s recalibration of the engine-driven fuel pump\u2019s adjustment screw would have only masked the debris issue within the throttle assembly.\u000bFurther, review of the manufacturer\u2019s approved engine-out emergency procedures indicated that with a rear engine failure, the propeller should be immediately feathered and the landing gear retracted after obstacle clearance. Therefore, even with a loss of rear engine power, the airplane\u2019s operating manual indicated that the airplane would have been able to climb at least 275 feet per minute with one engine, assuming the required pilot inputs were made. Had those single-engine climb performance conditions been met, the airplane likely would have been able to, at a minimum, maintain altitude until a safe landing could have been accomplished. However, as the rear propeller was found with a low pitch angle and the landing gear was found in the down and locked position after the accident, the airplane had not been configured for maximum single-engine performance as outlined in the engine-out procedures.  ",
            "probable_cause": "Maintenance personnel's failure to follow procedures and published directives in calibrating the continuous flow fuel system and failure to accurately diagnose debris in the throttle assembly, resulting in a loss of power in one engine.

One of the passengers reported that, while following cars and filming them, the pilot turned the helicopter about 180 degrees while not moving in a forward direction. The helicopter then started bucking forward and backward and, at the same time, began to spin downward until it impacted a building. A witness reported that he saw the helicopter flying about 100 feet above ground level at a very slow rate of forward airspeed in a west-to-east pattern while making multiple passes. He said that the helicopter was making 180-degree flat turns (without a banking attitude). A few minutes later, he saw the helicopter flying in a northwesterly direction, enter what he believed to be a short sudden autorotation, and then lose altitude. Postaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal any preexisting mechanical anomalies with the airframe, drive system, or engine that could have\u00a0contributed to the accident. Two segments of video were recovered from one of the video cameras onboard the helicopter. The second segment was 73 seconds long and contained the final moments of the accident flight. Sixty-one seconds into the\u00a0segment, the camera zoomed out, and the helicopter began a right rotation, before which, there was very little evidence of forward airspeed. Between 61 and 73 seconds, the helicopter completed two full right rotations. At 63 seconds, the helicopter pitched nose down, and, at 67 seconds, it then returned to nose level and lost altitude. At 68 seconds, the helicopter pitched nose up for 3 seconds. At 71 seconds, it pitched further nose up and then completed a quarter of a rotation before the video ended. From 67 seconds to the end of the recording, the main rotor blades came into view, and rotor blur was visible. Given the witness and video evidence, the helicopter likely experienced a loss of translational lift and corresponding loss of sufficient tail rotor authority to maintain level flight because the pilot was operating the helicopter out of ground effect at a low forward airspeed. In March 1999, Robinson Helicopter issued Safety Notice SN-34 to be included as a supplement in the R-44 Pilot Operating Handbook; a revision was issued in April 2009. The Safety Notice indicated, in part, that, \u201cAerial survey and photo flights should only be conducted by well trained, experienced pilots who\u2026Have at least 500 hours pilot-in-command in helicopters and over 100 hours in the model flown.\u201d The accident pilot had about 388 hours of total helicopter flight time, including about 41 hours in the accident model helicopter.\u000b\u000b\u000b\u000b\u000b\u000b\u000b",

The student's certified flight instructor (CFI) was not present at the airport on the day of the accident flight.  The CFI reported that on the previous day he had authorized his student to fly from San Diego to Long Beach, where the examination was to take place.  On the day of the accident the student pilot received a weather briefing about 2 hours prior to his departure.  He was advised, in part, that instrument meteorological conditions existed and were forecast along a portion of his planned route of flight, and that the conditions were forecast to improve.  Thereafter, the student telephoned his flight instructor and discussed the briefing, but (according to the student's CFI) he did not advise the CFI that the weather conditions were, in certain locations, below the limits established for his flying or that instrument weather conditions existed.  Without independently verifying the weather forecast, the CFI authorized the flight, and the student took off at his planned departure time on a northerly course paralleling the coastline.  After about 9 minutes of flight, at 1009:03, the student pilot stated to a local air traffic controller \"I'm in a little trouble\" and \"I'm gonna start climbing to get out of clouds.\"  The northbound student pilot commenced a left turn while flying northbound over the ocean.  This positioned the helicopter farther off shore.  During the turn the student pilot said to the controller, at 1009:45, \"I need to get out of the clouds   visibility is really bad out here.\"  At 1009:50, the controller said \"if you would like to go (inland) to the I-5 (interstate freeway) and follow north that's approved.\"  The pilot responded with his last recorded transmission and stated at 1010:00, \"Roger I'm gonna start climbing.\"  Recorded radar indicates that the pilot climbed from 200 to 600 feet, whereupon the radar track ended upon completion of a left 360-degree turn.  The helicopter wreckage was located 0.3 miles from its last radar location, and about 0.5 miles offshore.  An Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation safety inspector was located near the shoreline.  He reported observing fog along the coast and said the visibility was about 1/8-mile.  The student's CFI subsequently acknowledged to the Safety Board investigator that he had not independently ascertained the weather, but had relied upon what the student told him in authorizing the flight.  The CFI reported that, had he known the actual weather conditions, he would not have authorized the flight.  The FAA requires, before a CFI authorizes a student's solo cross-country flight, that the CFI has reviewed the current and forecast weather conditions and has determined that the flight can be completed under visual flight rules.

The mechanic placed the airplane on jacks, inspected, and functionally checked the landing gear.  No mechanical anomalies were noted, and the mechanic returned the airplane to service.  The pilot refueled the airplane to its capacity of 5.5 hours of flight time, and continued the flight to his destination airport.  Approximately 4 hours later he arrived at the destination airport and noted it was still light outside.  He placed the landing gear handle in the down position, but did not receive a down and locked indication inside the cockpit.  He then tried unsuccessfully to manually lower the landing gear several times, but it did not fully extend.  The pilot flew around the airport for an additional 1.5 hours trying to extend the landing gear.  At that point, he realized the airplane was in a low fuel state and it was dark outside.  He did not feel that he could safely make it a nearby airport and decided to make a precautionary landing.  Neither the pilot nor fire department personnel waiting on the ground could get the airport runway lights turned on.  The airplane landed short of the runway.  The Safety Board investigator-in-charge, and a Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness inspector examined the landing gear system.  With the use of an ohmmeter and the airplane's wiring diagram, they were able to determine that the nose landing gear limit switch had an intermittent fault in the normally closed circuit position.

The flight crew reacted to the uncommanded pitch-up event by adjusting the stabilizer trim position, attempting to move the elevator control columns forward, disengaging the autothrottle, and executing a go-around.  The airplane subsequently landed without incident and both crewmembers sustained minor injuries that were incurred during the go around.  Post-incident inspection of the elevator Power Control Units (PCUs) revealed that the left elevator PCU input control arm assembly was jammed by a piece of Foreign Object Debris (FOD) in a position that offset the control arm in a downward direction.  With the control arm deflected in this direction and with hydraulic pressure on, the left PCU moved the elevators to a position that pitched the airplane nose up independent of pilot input.  An assessment of information obtained from the FDR regarding the functional characteristics of the airplane\u2019s pitch control system indicates that the elevator control system was fully functional and operated as designed during previous flights and up until the uncommanded pitch event occurred.  According to Boeing, a jam in either the left or right PCU input control arm assembly could result in the loss of manual control of both elevator PCUs under hydraulic-powered operation.  The flight crew\u2019s immediate actions of exerting constant and excessive force on the control columns and executing a go-around at low altitude following the jam resulted in recovery of airplane pitch control despite high control forces.Metallurgical analysis revealed that the FOD had the same dimensions and material composition as the metal rollers that are contained in a DAS10-26B1-502 bearing, which is installed in only two locations in the aft elevator control system; the right and left ends of the elevator upper output torque tube crank assembly.  Post-incident inspections of the airplane\u2019s elevator system components located within the area of the tail cone also revealed that the left hand elevator upper torque tube output crank bearing/sleeve was completely intact with all rollers present.  Examination of the maintenance records revealed that the left elevator upper torque tube output crank bearing/sleeve assembly had been replaced in January 2009 to correct an elevator freeplay discrepancy on the incident airplane.  However, based on the available information, it could not be determined whether the metal rollers were left behind following the maintenance work performed in January 2009 or were present before the work was performed.",

The pilot was receiving radar flight following service as he descended in a southerly direction toward his destination, and he informed the controller that he was 'looking for a hole.'  The pilot then requested a special VFR clearance through the clouds; a request which was denied by the controller.  Upon reaching 6,000 feet, he headed toward the ocean, informed the controller that he observed a 'little hole,' and requested that the controller monitor his progress 'in case I do have to go in.'  The controller advised the pilot to maintain VFR. The pilot continued descending and reported that it was hazy, he was still VFR, and he thought he could make it.  At 1211:47, the controller informed the pilot that he would be losing radar coverage because the airplane was descending below the mountain range.

A review of an on-board video revealed the instructor and student were performing training maneuvers which included steep turns, stalls, accelerated stalls, unusual attitudes and recoveries from these to a wings level attitude using several techniques.  During the final maneuver, the instructor asked the student to lower the nose to \"about a hundred and forty knots\", and afterwards told the student to slowly pitch the nose upward \"until we're pointed straight up.\"  The airplane was seen climbing vertically up and visual contact with the ground disappeared.  The instructor then told the student to \"pull the way we just did a minute ago and pull the airplane into a stall.\"  A brief stall occurred, and then the airplane continued to pitch in the same direction, and its path resembled the remainder of an inside loop.  As the ground reappeared into the view, the aircraft was inverted and descending.  There was a slight roll to the left as the airplane was descending while its pitch attitude continued in the same trend toward a vertical nose down attitude.  While in a steep nose down attitude (no sky visible in the view), the instructor told the student to \"pull it into a stall right now.\"  At that moment, the recording ended.  The main wreckage came to rest on the side of a hard surface gravel road, and the left wing, left horizontal stabilizer, inboard section of left elevator, aft canopy frame, and a portion of the left wing skin were located in a wooded area approximately 0.4 miles southwest of the main wreckage.  The true history of the airframe could not be substantiated.  All applicable Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Directives had been complied with at the time of the accident.  Examination of the wing and carry-through structure revealed the structure failed as the result of extensive and widespread fatigue cracking in the -31 and -33 channels and the -3 and -85 webs.  The cracks in the channels were in hidden areas and probably could not have been directly detected without extensive disassembly of the structure.  However, the cracks in the webs would have been easily detected, and the crack in the forward web apparently was detected, based on the stop-drilled hole and the notes in the maintenance records.  The materials of the structure were in compliance with required specifications.  However, the workmanship was poor as indicated by the trapped debris and damaged holes.  This may have been acceptable standards of workmanship at the time of manufacture, but have since been recognized as having a large negative impact on fatigue life of the structures.  The fractured hole in the rear spar was recently inspected with no indication of cracks.  It is highly unlikely that the cracks initiated and grew to the current sizes in less than 40 hours of flight time since the inspection.  The localized damage and enlargement of the hole could have reduced the effectiveness of the inspection.  The fatigue cracking in the carry-through, the rear wing spar, and the horizontal stabilizer indicate that the fatigue life of the entire aircraft structure has been expended.  It is strongly suspected that these conditions may exist in other T-34 airframes.             ",

After departure, and as the airplane entered a climbing right turn to a track of about 260 degrees, the pilot reported to air traffic control that she was at 1,000 feet, climbing to 10,000 feet. The flight remained on a track of about 260 degrees and continued to accelerate and climb for 38 seconds. The pilot then declared an emergency, stating that she had an attitude indicator failure. At that moment, radar data depicted the airplane at 3,500 feet and 267 knots. Thirteen seconds later, the pilot radioed she wasn't sure which way she was turning. The transmission ended abruptly. Radar data indicated that at the time the transmission ended the airplane was in a steep, rapidly descending left turn. The fragmented airplane wreckage, due to impact and subsequent explosive forces, was located in a wooded area about 6 miles south-southwest of the departure airport. Examination of the accident site revealed a near vertical high-speed impact consistent with an in-flight loss of control. The on-site examination of the airframe remnants did not show evidence of preimpact malfunction. Examination of recovered engine remnants revealed evidence that both engines were producing power at the time of impact and no preimpact malfunctions with the engines were noted.The failure, single or dual, of the attitude indicator is listed as an abnormal event in the manufacturer's Pilot's Abbreviated Emergency/Abnormal Procedures. The airplane was equipped with three different sources of attitude information:  one incorporated in the primary flight display unit on the pilot's side, another single instrument on the copilot's side, and the standby attitude indicator. In the event of a dual failure, on both the pilot and copilot sides, aircraft control could be maintained by referencing to the standby attitude indicator, which is in plain view of the pilot. The indicators are powered by separate sources and, during the course of the investigation, no evidence was identified that indicated any systems, including those needed to maintain aircraft control, failed. The pilot called for a weather briefing while en route to the airport 30 minutes prior to departure and acknowledged the deteriorating weather during the briefing. Additionally, the pilot was eager to depart, as indicated by comments that she made before her departure that she was glad to be leaving and that she had to go. Witnesses indicated that as she was departing the airport she failed to activate taxi and runway lights, taxied on grass areas off taxiways, and announced incorrect taxi instructions and runways. Additionally, no Federal Aviation Administration authorization for the pilot to operate an aircraft between 29,000 feet and 41,000 feet could be found; the IFR flight plan was filed with an en route altitude of 38,000 feet.The fact that the airplane was operating at night in instrument meteorological conditions and the departure was an accelerating climbing turn, along with the pilot's demonstrated complacency, created an environment conducive to spatial disorientation.

The disassembly of the engine did not reveal any preexisting anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the engine. Both propellers had impact marks on the spinner from contact with a counterweight while the blade/counterweight was at a low pitch position. There were no impact marks or other indications to suggest that either propeller was feathered. Both propellers were turning and were driven toward a lower blade angle at impact as evidenced by the damage to the low pitch stop.  A review of the private pilot's flight logbook indicated the pilot had accumulated approximately 274 hours total flight time in all aircraft, with only 29 hours in the aircraft type and 5 hours of night flying experience logged.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's misjudged speed and altitude during approach that led to a long landing and his subsequent failure to maintain control during an attempted go-around.  Contributing to the accident were the dark night, the pilot's low total night flight experience, and low total time in the make and model airplane."

The pilot had requested and was receiving radar flight following service, but he had not requested minimum safe altitude warnings, and that service was not provided.  At 1752:55, the pilot contacted the TRACON radar facility and told the controller he was descending out of 5,800 feet inbound to the airport.  The controller told the pilot to fly his own navigation to the airport and to maintain VFR.  The controller terminated radar flight following service about 1 minute prior to the accident.  The airplane was last recorded on radar at 1759:30.  At this time, its ground speed had decreased to about 130 knots, its altitude had decreased to 1,700 feet, and the airplane's ground track was about 167 degrees, magnetic.  Two ground witnesses were about 1/3 mile from the crash site and reported observing the accident airplane fly by their position; however, their view of the airplane was restricted due to the presence of localized fog, and they had only observed the illumination of the airplane's flashing white strobe light as it flew past their location.  Minutes later, they observed the glow of a ground fire in the direction the airplane had been flying.  The three closest airports to the accident site that reported their weather conditions  were, respectively, 7 miles west-southwest, 8 miles northeast, and 12 miles south-southwest from the accident site.  Within 15 minutes of the accident, these three airports reported a clear sky, 5- to 10-mile visibility, and surface wind between 6 and 7 knots.  At 1755, the closest airport, which was northeast of the accident site, reported 5 miles visibility, mist, and a temperature/dew point of 9 and 8 degrees, respectively.  The on-scene accident investigation revealed that the airplane cruised into 28-degree upsloping terrain, and it was destroyed by impact forces and a post impact fire.  The initial impact point was at 1,660 feet mean sea level (msl), about 60 feet below the hilltop south of the site.  The bearing between the initial impact point and the main wreckage was 163 degrees.  No evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction was found during the wreckage examination.  The Safety Board investigator noted that when located on the hilltop south of the impact site, the pilot's destination was visible.  No higher elevation exists between the accident site hilltop and the airport.",

The private pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a post impact fire. The airplane was registered to KI Aircraft LLC and was being operated by a private individual as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight which was not operated on a flight plan. The flight originated from the Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport (AMA), Amarillo, Texas, at 1616. The intended destination for the flight was the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona. According to the fixed base operator (FBO) in AMA, the pilot landed his airplane and taxied to the FBO around 1525. The pilot instructed the line personnel to \"top off\" the airplane, which was subsequently filled with 20.9 gallons of 100 low lead fuel. The FBO personnel reported there was a \"light blowing sleet\" at the time, but that the airplane was free of any ice. The pilot left to eat and when he returned, he asked the customer service representative (CSR) if she knew of any airplanes at their facility that had just come in from or were leaving for Phoenix. The CSR replied that there were none. The pilot then struck up a conversation with two business jet pilots who were in the lobby. The FBO manager stated he spoke with the pilot and because the weather was deteriorating, he offered to put the pilot's airplane in a heated hangar for the night. The pilot stated he was not staying the night and that he would be departing shortly. Soon thereafter, the pilot left the FBO, started his airplane, and departed. One of the corporate jet pilots recalled the accident pilot walking in the FBO and asking if anyone was going to Phoenix. The accident pilot then asked him if he knew the altitudes of the ceiling and cloud tops. The accident pilot explained that he was trying to get to Phoenix and he was wondering if the cloud layer was thin enough for him to get through it. The business pilot stated that he had arrived on a flight from the east and that when they were on top of the clouds, the cloud layer extended as far as they could see. He also informed the pilot that they encountered rime and clear ice on their descent into AMA from the east. The accident pilot then questioned himself out loud as to whether or not he would be able to stay below the weather. They discussed the mountains east of Albuquerque. The accident pilot then opened his \"tablet\" and looked at a satellite image pointing out where he thought the cloud layer ended east of Santa Rosa, New Mexico. The business pilot told the accident pilot that a weather briefer would be able to give him information regarding the ceilings heights along his route. The accident pilot thanked him and departed the FBO. FBO personnel stated that after departing the FBO, the pilot performed an engine run-up and contacted air traffic control for his taxi clearance. After takeoff, the pilot was receiving visual flight rules (VFR) flight following from air traffic control. While in contact with the Albuquerque air route traffic control center (ZAB) the pilot made an inquiry about icing in the area and requested information regarding the tops of the cloud layer. The pilot mentioned that he might have to turn around and return to AMA. The controller offered the pilot several other airports in the area, but the pilot continued westbound. The controller questioned the pilot regarding the weather conditions and asked if he was familiar with the terrain. The pilot reported that he was familiar with the terrain and that he was below the clouds. The pilot then stated that he was going to fly to the Moriarty Airport (OEO), Moriarty, New Mexico, which was about 28 miles west of his position. Radar contact and communication with the airplane was lost about 1735.  The wreckage was located in a field 7 \u00bd miles north of Clines Corners, New Mexico. The Santa Fe Municipal Airport (SAF) Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) was located about 41 miles northwest of the accident site. At 1733, the SAF ASOS recorded weather conditions as: wind from 140 degrees at 23 knots gusting to 30 knots; visibility 10 miles; broken clouds at 1,500 feet above ground level (agl); temperature minus 7 degrees Celsius; dew point minus 14 degrees Celsius; altimeter 30.12 inches of mercury.The Albuquerque International Sunport Airport (ABQ) ASOS was located about 51 miles west of the accident site.

He reported that as he turned final approach to land, he added power, and the airplane decelerated and violently pitched nose down.  He said he applied additional power to raise the nose and arrest the rate of descent, but the nose pitched down further.  He indicated the airplane was low on final approach, in a level attitude, and descending rapidly.  He applied power again, but the airplane pitched down again.  The airplane continued to descend until it struck a curb, dirt berm, and an unoccupied vehicle in a parking lot near the approach end of the runway.  The pilot said there were no known mechanical anomalies with the airplane prior to the accident.  The airplane is equipped with a propeller that is capable of changing its pitch angle to provide reverse thrust for ground operations.  The airframe mounted anti-reverse safety devices, intended to prevent the propeller from reversing in-flight, were tested on the ground and found to function properly.   A third anti-reverse device, fly-weights in the propeller governor, could not be tested.  The propeller governor was removed and disassembled.  The electric propeller pitch change solenoid functioned properly, however the reversing valve, which is located in a valve body to which the solenoid is attached, was found stuck in what, according to schematics provided by the manufacturer, was consistent with the reverse pitch position. The reversing valve is intended to move freely within the valve body, but had to be forcefully removed.  The interior of the reversing valve body had a coating of carbon-like material around the interior.",

At 1103, the controller cleared to the airplane to descend to 11,000 feet and the pilot again acknowledged.  At 1110:21, the pilot was instructed to contact Tyndall Approach.  The pilot checked in with the Tyndall RAPCON North Approach controller at 1110:39.  The pilot was told to expect a visual approach.  Shortly thereafter, the pilot transmitted, \"...we're at 11,000, like to get down lower so we can get underneath this stuff.\"  The controller told the pilot to stand by and expect lower [altitude] in 3 miles.  About 15 seconds later, the controller cleared to pilot to descend to 6,000 feet, and the pilot acknowledged.  At 1112:27, the pilot was instructed to contact Tyndall Approach on another frequency.  The airplane's position at that time was just northwest of REBBA intersection.  The Panama sector controller cleared the pilot to descend to 3,000 feet at his discretion, and the pilot acknowledged.  There was no further contact with the airplane.  The controller attempted to advise the pilot that radar contact was lost, but repeated attempts to establish communications and locate the airplane were unsuccessful.  A witness, located approximately 1 mile south of the accident site, reported he heard a \"loud bang,\" looked up and observed the airplane in a nose down spiral.

He departed from his home base, for a 10 minute flight to pick up several passengers, taking groups of them on 5 to 10 minute photo flights, for a total mission duration of approximately 80 to 90 minutes.  After dropping off the last group, he returned to his home base.  According to the fuel gauge, there was approximately 12 to 13 gallons of fuel remaining when he departed for the 10 minute repositioning flight back to his home base.  Based on a fuel burn rate of approximately 25 gallons per hour, he calculated that he had 30 minutes of fuel remaining. He also stated that, due to noise abatement, he always approached his helipad at a \"high airspeed and with a fast rate of descent and then about 100 feet, power up to make a high power, steep landing.\"  Being \"low on fuel,\" he did the same thing on this approach, starting his descent at approximately 80 to 100 knots.  At 50 to 75 feet above ground level (agl), he initiated a 10 to 20 degree flare and began the descent to land.  The fuel boost pump light illuminated, the \"auto-relight\" light came on, and the \"engine out\" light illuminated.  His first thought was that he \"ran the aircraft out of fuel.\"  He realized that he was going too fast to land at his helipad.  He adjusted his approach, and attempted to land in a parking lot just beyond his pad.  He applied forward cyclic control, to level out the helicopter, hoping the boost pump light would go out and that the \"auto relight\" would reignite the fuel if it started pumping.  The helicopter struck the ground hard with its right landing gear skid, bounced, slid forward approximately 15 feet, turned to its left approximately 90 degrees and slowly rolled over on its right side.  The aircraft continued to turn to the left another 90 degrees and came to rest on its right side, facing 180 degrees from the direction of the approach.

He drained the water and filled the fuel tanks in preparation for the upcoming delivery flight to the owner. The pilot and his passenger departed the airport, which is approximately at sea level, and made an uneventful flight to an airport about 270 miles away at an elevation of 2,118 feet. After refueling, the pilot observed other airplanes departing on runway 17 but decided to use runway 35 due to his observation of wind conditions, which indicated very light wind from the north. The pilot's observation of the wind direction was not supported by the recorded meteorological data, which indicated a 3-knot wind from 230 degrees. However, a note for the airport in the FAA Airport/Facilities Directory stated that \"Varying wind direction and velocity may be encountered at midpoint of Rwy 17\u201335 due to terrain features and wind flow patterns\"; therefore, the actual wind conditions at the time of the airplane\u2019s departure could not be determined. At the time of the attempted takeoff, the temperature was 34 degrees Celsius, resulting in a density altitude of about 4,860 feet. The pilot reported that the engine runup was normal and that the takeoff seemed normal until the airplane reached the end of the runway, where the climb performance deteriorated. The airplane was unable to clear the obstacles beyond the end of the runway, impacted trees and terrain, and came to rest about 1,600 feet beyond the runway end. A postimpact fire consumed much of the airframe and all of the baggage, which included some of the airplane\u2019s records. After the accident, the pilot reported that the takeoff and climb for the previous flight was normal but that during cruise, the airplane seemed to operate at a higher pitch attitude than expected. The condition of the wreckage precluded any evaluation of the primary factors, such as wing or control surface rigging or the accuracy of the tachometer or airspeed indicator, that could have accounted for the reported phenomenon. According to the data presented in the published airplane performance information, takeoff and continued flight should have been possible. However, the expected takeoff and climb performance could not be accurately determined because it was not possible to account for multiple differences between the performance data baseline conditions and the actual or reported conditions, such as airplane weight, runway slope, flap setting, and speed. The pilot did not report any engine roughness or rpm loss; therefore, the event was not consistent with water ingestion by the engine. Examination of the engine revealed compression deficiencies in some cylinders, but it could not be determined whether those were present before the accident and fire.

The photographer asked for a different vantage point; as the pilot explained that wind and high power demands would prevent him from accommodating the request, the helicopter began to \"settle with power.\" The pilot attempted to arrest the descent with a reduction of power and a forward cyclic input. As the pilot took the corrective action, the helicopter yawed to the right and began to rotate around the main rotor mast. He reduced the throttle to idle to arrest the spin, and the yaw rate slowed. However, the spin continued as the helicopter descended through about 250 feet agl. The pilot stated that the helicopter was still spinning when it struck the ground upright. Review of an audio recording from a video camera aboard the helicopter indicated that the low rotor rpm audio alarm was on during the final 7 seconds of the flight. A witness reported that the engine ran \"fine\" and \"perfectly\" all the way to ground contact.Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. The helicopter was operating in a high-power, low-airspeed condition that required the pilot to be especially aware of wind direction in order to avoid tailwinds, which can result in a loss of control due to settling with power and/or a loss of tail rotor effectiveness. Although the pilot\u2019s comment to the photographer indicated that he was concerned about the wind angle, it is likely that he did not maintain a nose-into-the-wind position. When the helicopter began to settle with power, the rotor rpm dropped, and the tail rotor lost effectiveness.

According to the commercial pilot, they were returning to the departure airport after satisfactorily completing all of the required maneuvers when the FAA inspector unexpectedly announced he was simulating an engine failure and chopped the throttle. As the commercial pilot attempted to recover the helicopter from the maneuver, she realized the helicopter had experienced an actual power loss. The FAA inspector attempted to troubleshoot the power loss and the commercial pilot prepared for a straight-ahead forced landing to a road. During the descent, the FAA inspector instructed the commercial pilot to turn the helicopter into the wind, and came on the controls to initiate a turn which resulted in a flight path toward wooded terrain, and away from the road. Shortly after, the helicopter impacted trees and terrain in an upright attitude. Examination of the helicopter revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.The commercial pilot had accumulated 206 hours of flight experience, all of which was in light piston-powered helicopters, and a majority of which was gained exclusively in the make and model of the accident helicopter.

There was no flight hour requirement for maintaining their proficiency. Additionally FAA inspectors in the \"4040\" program were not required to accumulate any recent flight experience in specific helicopter make and model/type.
