Instead he gathered his weather information by making a phone call to an acquaintance who was located at his destination and by checking with the FAA's Flight Watch while en route. As he proceeded toward his destination the pilot began flying over a scattered-to-broken cloud layer, which eventually turned to overcast as he neared his destination. After realizing that he would not be able to get into his planned destination, he attempted to get to another airport, but the weather also deteriorated at that airport as well. The pilot then reversed course and headed back in the direction he had come from in the hopes of finding an airport that had visual meteorological conditions (VMC). He was eventually able to descend through a hole in the clouds, but had to pass up the nearest airport because of the bad weather there. He eventually located an airport with VMC, but his airplane ran out of fuel while on a half-mile final. Although he was able to glide to the approach end of the runway, the pilot reported that he landed on the threshold and the airplane bounced once, then settled on the runway. As the tail came down, a gust of wind hit the airplane, which subsequently ground-looped and resulted in substantial damage to the lower left side longeron.",

He initially noted the rpm showed 2,300, rpm and during the takeoff roll the rpm showed 2,500 rpm. The Pilot's Operating Handbook states that full throttle 2,700 rpm is required for takeoff.  The throttle slipped back about 1/2 inch on two different occasions, and the pilot pushed the throttle back in. No increase in engine power was noted and he continued the takeoff roll. Once airborne, the pilot retracted the landing gear and continued applying full throttle. The throttle felt like it was sticking and the engine was not producing full power. The airplane reached about 75 to 100 feet, and was not climbing.  The pilot realized he would not clear wires and trees to his immediate front and applied aft pressure on the control yoke to decrease his airspeed and the impending impact. Examination of the airplane wreckage revealed the throttle cable was hard to move and fractured. The throttle cable was removed, and forwarded to the NTSB Materials Laboratory.

He began by flying approximately 600-800 feet above the ridge.  After completing several circuits, the pilot stated the air became turbulent, so he climbed 1000 feet.  After completing several circuits at the new altitude, the pilot decided to reverse directions and fly a clockwise pattern.

He reported that during the flight the weather began changing and he arrived at the destination airport in unforecast deteriorating weather conditions. Unable to circle to land into the wind, the pilot elected to land on runway 12 with a gusting quartering right tailwind. During the landing roll, a wind gust pushed the nose of the airplane to the right, and the airplane began to slide momentarily on an icy patch on the runway. While sliding sideways, the left main landing gear contacted bare pavement, which resulted in the collapse of the left main landing gear. As a result, the airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.The wind at the airport before landing was reported to be out of 339 degrees at 26 knots, with gusts to 35 knots. According to the pilot operating handbook for the accident airplane, the maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the airplane is 20 knots, and a plot of the current wind conditions at the time of the accident showed that the crosswind component for the accident landing was 30 knots, 10 knots above the maximum demonstrated component.No preaccident mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation were reported.",

United reports that the flight encountered severe turbulence approximately abeam ANC while descending through FL310, on the way to a cruise altitude of FL 300.  This altitude change was due to a previous report that indicated that a JAL flight had moderate turbulence at FL320, and FL300 was reported 'mostly smooth'.  The Captain reported the encounter was \"brief\" and included an airplane roll moment left and right along with a pitch up 'wave' action.  The stick shaker activated momentarily, and indicated airspeed was about 306 KIAS FL310-FL300.  MMO was never exceeded during this period.  The seat belt sign was on at the time for passengers and flight attendants. The decision was to continue to destination after assessing airplane systems and passenger/flight attendant condition.  There were various communications between the flight and United operations to confirm airplane passenger and crew condition.  The remainder of the flight and landing were uneventful. The FAA was not notified at the time of the event of the possible injuries to the passengers and crew.  There were 19 crew members and 243 passengers on board.  The on ground inspection has been completed and there was no exterior structural damage to the airplane related to the severe turbulence.  The interior damage currently has 25 cabin related defects logged. These include PSU panels through-out the passenger cabin that have been damaged. A few seats may need to be replaced. There are some dents & deep scratches in sidewalls & ceiling panels. A preliminary report from United indicates that 17 passengers and 9 flight attendants received injuries.

Other pilots whose airplanes were also parked outside overnight stated that about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of snow/frost covered a layer of ice on their airplanes the morning of the accident.

Examination of fuel records and conversation with the fixed base operator revealed the airplane was 'topped off' prior to the 4-hour first leg.  The airplane was serviced with 20 gallons of fuel prior to the return leg.  Examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies, and less than 1-gallon of fuel was recovered from the fuel system.  The flaps were fully retracted.  The ninth hole was 455 yards long and oriented east-west on a straight line from tee to green.  According to the owner's manual, the procedure for a short field landing was: '...make a power-off approach at approximately 67 MPH with flaps 40 [degrees], and land on the main wheels first.  Immediately after touchdown, lower the nose gear to the ground and apply heavy braking as required.' ",

In the year since the purchase, due to the low build-quality of the airplane, the pilot had made several modifications and repairs to the airplane. The accident flight was the pilot\u2019s fifth flight in the airplane.

The pilot thought his best alternative was a forced landing to a corn field, which was accomplished but the airframe sustained substantial damage. Post crash examination by FAA inspectors revealed adequate fuel was aboard. Examination of engine, fuel, ignition, and airframe components revealed the fuel selector cover assembly was loose, missing mounting screws, and had shifted aft of its designed position. Such a repositioning would render the mechanical safety stop that would prevent an inadvertent switch to \"off\" inoperative.

The dual student was flying, and, according to statements by the flight instructor and student, he initiated the landing flare too high above the runway and allowed the nose of the airplane to get too high.  The instructor told him to lower the nose, and then assisted him in lowering it slightly.  As the student continued the approach and reduced engine power, the airspeed deteriorated until the stall warning horn came on.  Prior to touchdown, a gust of wind raised the left wing, and the right wing struck the runway.  The flight instructor took control and landed the airplane.  In the NTSB Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident Report submitted by the instructor and the student, the section titled, Recommendation (How could this accident been prevented?), contained, in part, the following statement:  \"This mishap was primarily a function of the student flaring high\u2026and running out of airspeed, causing a stall.  The high flare was compounded by the gusty crosswind conditions and not taking timely, positive action to go around\"  ",

On the second airlift, shortly after the logs were laid on the ground, a shudder was felt in the helicopter airframe followed by a slight yaw to the right. On the instrument panel, there was a needle jump in the triple tachometer gauge followed by a very loud bang. The helicopter began a violent left hand descending spin towards the ground. As the helicopter descended, it collided with trees and subsequently the ground. Within seconds the helicopter burst into flames. Examination of the helicopter revealed, the cockpit and the main fuselage of the helicopter were fire damaged. The tail boom was partially fire damaged, and tail rotor blades were bent and connected to the tail rotor transmission. The tail rotor drive shaft was intact and connected to the main rotor transmission. The five main rotor blades were connected to the main rotor head and displayed buckling and deformation damage. Further examination of the main transmission revealed that the left input free wheel unit turned and freewheeled, but made a grinding noise when turned in the freewheel direction. Further examination of the left input free wheel unit revealed the gear housing was worn with numerous roller impressions on the gear housing. The rollers were also rough in surface appearance. The right input free wheel unit operated in both directions without making any detectable noise. Record review of the input free wheel unit assemblies were conducted, and it was reported that the time since overhauled on the components was 960 hours. Sikorsky recommends that free wheel unit times should between overhauls of 350 hours. The FAA-H-8083-21 rotor Flying Handbook notes that pilots need to be familiar with the Height/Velocity diagrams for the particular models of rotorcraft the pilots are flying. Operating at the altitudes and airspeeds shown within the cross-hatched or shaded areas of the Height/Velocity diagram may not allow enough time for the critical transition from powered flight to autorotation. The helicopter operated about 150 feet above the ground inside the shaded area of the Height/ Velocity Curve. ",

The pilot/owner of the airplane reported that he was aware of the worn, frayed and torn engine baffling, and he planned to have it replaced at the airplane\u2019s next annual inspection.

The pilot was having 'trouble maintaining rotor rpm.'  With higher terrain in front and to his left, he elected to turn east in hopes of exiting the draw to the south.  Trees and rough terrain forced him to continue eastward.  The pilot found himself below a draw and he pulled collective control.

He said there was approximately 1/2 inch of rime ice, or more, on the airplane.  He established a best-glide airspeed, and selected the closest airport on his GPS.  As he broke out of the clouds, at approximately 8,000 feet, he saw the airport in front of him.  He attempted an engine restart with no success.  During the restarting attempt, he did not use the auxiliary fuel pump to prime the engine as specified in the \"Engine Failure During Flight\" checklist in the Pilot Operating Handbook.  The pilot said he flew directly to the middle of the airport, instead of setting up for a landing.  As he approached the airport, he put the landing gear down.  He realized that he was at a low altitude, approximately 750 feet above the ground, but attempted to make a 180 degree turn to the airport beneath him.  He landed in a field, and rolled into the airport's perimeter fence.  The airplane nosed over, damaging the vertical stabilizer, the right wing, and the fuselage.

The individual providing VFR advisory service advised that before the collision, he observed the AS-350B helicopter, but never saw the EC 130 B4 helicopter.  Both pilots had established two-way communication with the individual providing VFR advisory service on the unauthorized frequency being utilized, but the pilot of the EC 130 B4 helicopter reportedly did not provide a position report on the initial contact.  The pilot of the AS-350B helicopter reportedly never heard communications from the pilot of the EC 130 B4 helicopter, and he did not see the other helicopter before the collision.  Pyrotechnics occurred immediately before the collision in the area of the collision.  Impact damage to the power supply of the upper strobe light for the EC 130 B4 helicopter precluded consistent operation during postaccident testing; the strobe light operationally tested satisfactory.  The heliport operational procedures did not specify a single-point entry, nor reporting points, but did state that every effort shall be made to arrive via the east/west oriented canal that was located south of the heliport.  Safety briefings suggested in Advisory Circular (AC) 00-61 were not conducted, nor was flight-testing to verify whether there were any issues related to installation of temporary lighting.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of both pilot's to maintain visual lookout resulting in the mid-air collision.  A factor in the accident was the failure of the AS-350B pilot to follow approach procedures suggested in the Speedway Heliport Operations Manual.  Findings in the investigation were the intentional operation of the EC 130 B4 helicopter by the pilot with known deficiencies in equipment (inoperative landing light), and failure of Speedway Heliport personnel to: 1) conduct a safety briefing in advance of the race, 2) flight test temporary lighting to see whether any issues exist, and 3) require a single point entry and reporting point for approach to the heliport."

The panel had been last removed by company maintenance personnel performing maintenance relating to the autopilot system. The forward flat portion of panel had four screw holes in the underlying structure, but the fairing had only three screw holes. Inspection of the operator's other EA500 airplanes showed that some fairings made use of four screw holes while others made use of three screw holes even though four screw holes were available in the underlying structure. An inspection of the airplane revealed that all of the screws were intact except for three screws located at the forward flat edge of the fairing. The respective nuts for these three screws were in place. All but one of the screws and grommets for the curved fairing piece had pulled through the fairing and were attached to the underlying structure. Two and possibly three screw holes at the forward edge of the flat piece of fairing did not have grommets in place and radial cracking of the finished coat was observed at these holes. Also, a delamination ring was observed on the backside of the flat piece of fairing at the screw holes. With the absence of grommets there is a reduced force necessary to pull through the fairing. The outer diameter of the screw head and grommet differ by 0.040 inch. Larger grommets with an integral flange are used in other areas of the airplane, which provide more surface area, distribute contact forces, and improve adhesion to the screw hole.

The witnesses added that, just before the airplane disappeared below a tree line, a parachute deployed but did not inflate. Even though the airframe manufacturer did not set a minimum altitude for deployment of the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS), data suggests that a successful deployment of the system below 900 feet above ground level while an airplane is in a spin is improbable. Review of data downloaded from the multifunction and primary flight displays revealed that prior to the initiation of the accident sequence, the airplane was maneuvering between 3,257 feet and 3,131 feet, heading between 078 degrees to 064 degrees. The engine rpm varied between 2,440 rpm to 1,050 rpm. The indicated airspeed varied between 50 to 75 knots. About 31 seconds before the accident, the engine rpm increased to 2,500 rpm and the airplane's indicated airspeed was 54 knots.

Both airplanes were able to land at KCLL following the collision. The Cirrus SR22 sustained substantial damage to the upper cockpit fuselage structure and the commercial pilot sustained minor injuries. The Cessna 152 sustained minor damage to the right main landing gear assembly and the flight instructor and student pilot were not injured. The Cirrus was owned by a private individual, but operated by the Cirrus Aircraft Corporation as demonstration airplane. The Cessna 152 was owned and operated by the Texas A&M; Flying Club. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Both flights were being conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The Cirrus SR22 departed Austin Executive Airport (KEDC) at 0748 and was en route to KCLL. The Cessna 152 departed KCLL at 0744 for a local instructional flight.According to a statement provided by the Cirrus pilot, after departure he proceeded direct to KCLL under visual flight rules conditions. After the airplane had climbed above the departure airport\u2019s traffic pattern altitude he engaged the autopilot system. The flight climbed to the desired cruise altitude of 3,500 feet mean sea level (msl) while proceeding direct KCLL. The pilot reported that as the airplane approached KCLL with the autopilot system engaged, at 3,500 feet msl, the windshield imploded from an apparent impact with an external object. He initially thought that his airplane had impacted a bird because he had not received any alerts from the airplane\u2019s traffic advisory system nor did he see another aircraft before the impact. He subsequently recovered from an unintended descent before proceeding direct toward KCLL after declaring an emergency with the tower controller. The pilot reported that he had not established radio contact with the tower controller before the collision. A landing was made on runway 16 without further incident.According to a statement provided by the Cessna flight instructor, the local area training flight was with a primary student on her second instructional flight. The flight consisted of basic attitude flight maneuvers, including level and climbing turns, climbs and descents to predetermined altitudes, and maintaining level flight while tracking a course. The flight instructor stated that they were climbing to 3,500 feet msl while maintaining a southeast heading when they felt an impact and heard a loud bang. He reported that the impact originated from the right side of the airplane, aft of the main cabin. The flight instructor noted that there were no apparent flight control issues after the collision and that he visually ascertained that there was no damage to the right wing. Shortly after the collision, his student saw another airplane in a rapid descent at their 10-o\u2019clock position. The flight instructor entered a descending left turn to follow the other airplane. Shortly thereafter, the flight instructor heard another airplane declare an emergency on the tower frequency due to an imploded windshield. He noted that they were monitoring the tower frequency before the collision, but had not established radio contact with the tower controller. He turned in the general direction of KCLL with the intention of returning to the airport, while continuing to monitor the tower controller\u2019s communications with the other aircraft. The flight instructor noted that at some point he told the tower controller that they had hit something and were returning to the airport. The tower controller requested that the Cessna stay west of the airport while the other aircraft landed. After the other airplane had landed, the tower controller transmitted that the other airplane had tire marks on its roof and requested that they make a low approach in order to verify the condition of their landing gear. The flight instructor stated that he then visually ascertained that his airplane was missing its right main landing gear wheel. His student, seated in the left seat, then visually confirmed that the left landing gear and wheel appeared undamaged. After informing the tower controller of their damage, they were asked to perform a low pass and then to circle the airport until emergency equipment was in position. After circling the airport several times the flight instructor made an uneventful landing on runway 22.At 0753, the KCLL automated surface observing system reported the following weather conditions: wind calm, visibility 10 miles, sky clear, temperature 7 degrees Celsius, dew point 3 degrees Celsius, altimeter setting 30.35 inches of mercury.",

He entered the airport pattern, flew one circuit of the pattern to check the wind sock.  He turned onto the base leg, and a few seconds later turned onto final.  After turning onto final the engine lost power.  He immediately checked the fuel selector, added full throttle to the engine, checked the propeller control, mixture and booster pump to the high boost position.

Fuel calculations revealed that fuel consumption for the length of this flight would be close to exhausting the fuel in the main tanks, and that the fuel in the main tanks was near empty when the pilot switched to the auxiliary tank.  The auxiliary tank was gravity fed into the right main tank, and not to the selector valve.

They diverted to an alternate destination, and notified air traffic control (ATC). The propeller was adjusted but continued to overspeed. The pilot rated passenger managed engine and propeller rpm while the pilot flew the airplane at the manufacturer's best glide speed of 110 knots, but the engine continued to overspeed as the propeller provided no thrust. As propeller thrust and altitude decayed, the airplane descended through a cloud layer. When the airplane broke out beneath the cloud layer, the pilot selected a field for a forced landing area due to the fact that the surrounding terrain was wooded. Upon touchdown, the airplane bounced, the nose gear collapsed, and the airplane skidded to a stop. The pilot and pilot rated passenger stated that prior to the accident flight an annual inspection was completed and a newly overhauled propeller was installed. Disassembly of the propeller system after the accident revealed the rear pitch change rod bushing separated from the rear hub half and became loose in the hub. The bushing displayed traces of bonding sealant; however, the hub bore for the bushing did not. The hub cavity and the area on the aft side of the propeller piston, which are normally dry, contained \"significant\" amounts of oil. Pressurized oil on both sides of the propeller piston resulted in a hydraulic lock, fixed pitch condition. Using the as-found condition of the accident propeller system, engineers determined that airspeed of 97 knots or slower would be required to create positive thrust from the propeller system. After the accident, the propeller manufacturer revised its inspection and repair criteria, and changed the pitch change rod bushing installation procedure from one that used bonding sealants, to one that required a spiral retaining ring. The use of bonding sealants was no longer permitted.",

After conducting the missed approach, the pilot requested to divert to Fort Meyers where they had a precision approach.  Fort Meyers was reporting 300-foot ceilings and 3 statute miles of visibility at the time of the accident.  The pilot conducted three approaches to Fort Meyers.  The pilot was unable to obtain/maintain the final approach course and conducted a teardrop course reversal on the first two approaches to Fort Meyers before reaching the final approach fix.  The pilot indicated he was experiencing \"very big difficulties out here\" and mentioned instrument problems, but was going to try to fly the next approach manually.  The controller asked the pilot about his fuel status, to which the pilot reported it was in the yellow range.  When the controller asked how much time that was, the pilot responded it was \"practically nil.\"  The controller then set the pilot up for another precision approach attempt and eventually converted it to a surveillance approach when it became apparent the pilot was having trouble obtaining and maintaining the final approach course.  The airplane's radar track was over the final approach course during the final approach attempt; however, the airplane's minimum altitude was 300 feet over the approach end of the runway.  The airplane overflew the runway and began a climb to 600 feet.  The airplane then descended to 300 feet again as it began a left turn.  The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain 1,500 feet and provided two vectors, neither of which the aircraft followed.  The maximum altitude the airplane attained during the last missed approach was 1,200 feet before it began its final, uncontrolled descent.  The last communication obtained from the pilot was during the initiation of the missed approach.  The airplane departed controlled flight and impacted a garage and terrain.  Wreckage was strewn 350 feet.  The airplane was observed descending out of the clouds heading south at a low altitude, with the landing gear retracted, full power and a high rate of speed.  Additional witnesses heard engine noise emanating from the airplane prior to both engines going silent.  The propellers separated from the engines and the engines separated from the airplane.

The solo student pilot, who was on an instructional cross-country flight, was not injured.  The student pilot reported that he \"taxied onto the runway for departure and the airplane began to pull to the left.  I then added more correction but couldn't prevent the aircraft from going off the runway.  The left wing hit the wind sock and then the plane came to a rest.\"  The student pilot had a total of 58 hours of flight time with 9.9 hours as pilot in command.  The observed surface winds at 1554 were 240 degrees at 15 knots, gusting to 21 knots. ",
