Soon after, the rumbling became louder, the oil temperature increased, the oil pressure dropped to \"zero,\" and the engine stopped producing power.  The flight instructor adjusted the flight controls for autorotation, and selected a high school athletic field for the forced landing.  He attempted to extend the helicopter's glide to reach the field, while maintaining rotor rpm.  Just prior to touchdown, the tail of the helicopter struck the athletic field's perimeter fence, which resulted in a loss of control, and collision with terrain.  Examination of the helicopter's engine revealed that the oil suction screen was completely occluded by metal particles.  The number 3 cylinder was removed, and the associated piston and connecting rod were stuck in the cylinder bore.  The connecting rod was fractured at the yoke, and free of the crankshaft.  The connecting rod cap was fragmented, and the fragments were found scattered in the oil sump.

The airplane rotated about the \"Delta\" intersection and approximately 1 minute 36 seconds after the controller cleared the flight to takeoff, the tower controller asked the pilot is she was experiencing any difficulty, to which she replied, \"slightly uh i may have to circle.\"  The tower controller and an FAA employee both noted that the airplane was porpoising at a point approximately 6,000 feet down the 9,000 foot runway; the airplane was at between 80 and 100 feet agl.  The flight crew of a U.S. Airways flight next in line for takeoff reported that the airplane never climbed higher than approximately 300 feet agl, and began drifting to the left.  The flight continued and when near the end of the runway, a witness later reported that the engine sounded like it was operating at full throttle and the airplane was porpoising.  A witness near the accident site reported that the engine was surging and the airplane pitched nose-up, then banked to the left in about a 45-degree angle of bank.  The airplane then pitched nose down followed by impact with trees then the ground.  Witnesses near the accident site reported hearing discrepancies related to the engine immediately before the airplane pitched nose down.  Examination of the engine, and flight controls revealed no evidence of  preimpact failure or malfunction.  The forward baggage compartment was found to contain cargo that weighed a total of approximately 244 pounds; the limitation is 100 pounds.  The remaining cargo scattered throughout the airplane and/or located outside the airplane weighed a total of approximately 211 pounds.  The NTSB has not talked with the pilot nor received the NTSB report form sent to the attorney representing the pilot and airplane owner.  As a result, since the exact placement of cargo could not be determined, all cargo except that located in the forward baggage compartment was placed in the aft baggage compartment for calculation purposes.  An individual did note cargo in the aft portion of the cabin before the flight departed.  At the time of takeoff, the airplane was approximately 8 pounds under gross weight and was greater than 4 inches forward of the forward center of gravity limit.  The center of gravity moved further forward when some of the cargo that was found in the cockpit and cabin was placed in the cabin, instead of all being placed in the aft baggage compartment for calculation purposes.  Personnel from the airplane manufacturer would not comment on the flight characteristics of an airplane being operated outside the center of gravity envelope.  Analysis of voice transmissions was negative for determination of engine/propeller rpm and any of the times of communication from the pilot.  Testing of fuel from the facility that fueled the airplane indicated the fuel met specification.  The pilot had agreements with at least one individual and one company that paid her a yearly fee to transport mail to and from the Bahamas.  Additionally, the FAA reported the pilot was carrying property for compensation or hire contrary to 14 CFR Part 119.5(g).  The pilot advised an individual in the Bahamas that he did not have to speak to FAA if the FAA made an inquiry.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's exceeding the forward center of gravity (CG) ) limits at the time of engine start, the inability of the pilot to control the airplane due to the exceeded CG limits, the failure of the pilot to abort the takeoff with sufficient runway remaining, and the inadvertent stall by the pilot while maneuvering shortly after takeoff."

He said the aircraft was stabilized at that speed, and he never exceeded that airspeed at anytime.

Soon thereafter, the right engine power settled back to about 1,400 rpm. While the pilot was trying to find out what was wrong with the engine, the aircraft's cabin door popped open. Instead of making a precautionary landing at one of the airports he passed en route, the pilot attempted to continue on to his ultimate destination. Because he was having trouble holding altitude with the door partially open and the right engine at 1,400 rpm, the pilot elected to shut down the right engine. After shutting down the engine, it became obvious to the pilot that he could not make it to the airport, so he elected to land in a nearby field.

The accident flight was intended to enable technical personnel to conduct a site survey for the planned installation of a communications repeater tower near the top of a mountain. The sheriff's department pilot had satisfactorily completed training for and had demonstrated confined area, slope, and pinnacle landings. None of the three passengers were helicopter pilots, and no anti-torque pedals were installed at the front passenger's station. The mountain's remote location and its topography prevented postaccident availability of specific meteorological conditions at the time of the accident, but analysis of available data indicated that mostly overcast skies, intermittent rain, and a generally westerly wind at 10 to 15 knots were present. Those conditions were within the helicopter's and pilot's performance capabilities. The helicopter orbited the peak for general reconnoitering before the pilot attempted a landing. The pilot's selected landing zone was on a relatively level area of a pinnacle on the northeast side of the mountain, and the approach was from the southeast. The passengers reported that during the landing attempt, they felt a bump, and the helicopter rose a few feet, then the nose pitched down, and the helicopter began to spin to the right. The main rotor blades struck a rock outcrop, and the helicopter tumbled and slid about 120 feet down a shallow canyon on the northeast face of the peak before it was halted by rocks and scrub vegetation. The wreckage was examined in situ, recovered, and examined in detail. All components were accounted for. All damage patterns were consistent with the helicopter's low-speed impact with terrain in the horizontal and vertical planes, and its subsequent tumble down the canyon. The engine successfully met specification power settings during an operational run in a test fixture. No evidence of any preexisting mechanical defect or malfunction was noted during the examination or testing of the airframe and engine. Main and tail rotor damage patterns and debris distribution were consistent with rotor strikes under power. The witness and passenger descriptions of the helicopter's motions are consistent with a tail rotor ground strike and a subsequent loss of directional control.

The aircraft was being operated by Continental Airlines as a passenger flight from Newark, New Jersey to Frankfurt, Germany. None of the occupants were injured and the airplane sustained minor damage. The airplane had accumulated 6,062 cycles and 40,581 hours in about 9 years of service. Examination of the left MLG revealed two circumferential fractures that divided the assembly into three pieces. Metallurgical examination of the fracture surface revealed intergranular stress corrosion cracking (SCC) emanating from a corrosion pit on the lower inside diameter of the truck beam. Corrosion protection of the truck beam interior surface consists of a three part system: cadmium plating, primer, and CIC. Several areas on the inner surfaces exhibited deterioration of the protective finishes. Examination revealed damage ranged from paint blisters, to exposed metal substrate, to significant corrosion and pitting. Sections of the primer in the forward section of the truck beam had a soft wrinkled appearance and had delaminated from the substrate. Several samples of finishes and lubricants were removed from the fractured truck beam and analyzed for chemical composition. Organics residues consistent with BMS 3-11 hydraulic fluid and components of runway de-icing fluids were found in the samples. The failure of the truck beam occurred due to the presence of hydraulic fluid and deicing fluid in the truck beam interior. The long term exposure to hydraulic fluid and deicing fluid led to delamination of the CIC and primer from the interior surface leading to corrosion of the cadmium plating. Once the cadmium plating was consumed, corrosion of the steel followed. Liberated corrosion and delamination products plugged the aft drain hole trapping more water inside the truck beam that lead to pitting corrosion on the lower inside diameter of the truck beam aft of the pivot bushing. The tensile stress and the presence of water led to intergranular SCC. Once the crack grew to a critical size, a circumferential fracture occurred and separated the aft portion of the truck beam.",

He climbed to and set the power for a cruise altitude of 7,500 feet, and noted that his digital engine monitor indicated an engine speed of 2,300 rpm. Shortly thereafter, without any unusual noises or vibration, the engine speed decreased to 1,100 rpm, the manifold pressure appeared unchanged, and the airplane started to descend. The pilot exercised the propeller control to increase the rpm, but there was no response to his inputs. He declared an emergency, and attempted to divert to a nearby airport, but then elected to perform an off-airport landing in a field. During the rollout, the airplane struck bushes and trees that bordered the field. The pilot received minor injuries, and there was no fuel spill. Post-accident examination of the airplane revealed that the two inboard fuel tanks were full, the right outboard contained several gallons, and the left outboard tank contained only trace amounts of fuel.

Engine monitor data showed that during the flight, combustion had ceased, but the propeller continued to windmill during the 6 minutes of the descent.

He then added throttle and attempted to dump the load, but the dump-stop prevented him from jettisoning the load. The pilot stated that at the very end of the runway the airplane lifted off, followed by the tailwheel impacting a small ridge, which slowed the airplane. The aircraft subsequently cleared a ditch and then started impacting young trees, with large trees directly in front of him. The pilot added that he then pulled the power off and landed in a field of young trees. The upper and lower wing panels were substantially damaged. The pilot stated that the accident could have been prevented had he made sure that the dump stop was flipped over prior to takeoff, which would have allowed the load to be dumped faster. The pilot also stated that due to the temperature having increased from what it was earlier that morning, he should have reduced his chemical load. The density altitude at the time of the accident was calculated to be about 2,042 feet mean sea level (msl); the elevation of the airstrip was about 90 feet msl.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. According to the pilot, he had not flown the airplane in about three years, and in the days preceding the accident flight, had been inspecting the airplane. The inspection included removing the carburetor float bowls to check for contamination, performing run-up checks of the engine, and performing several high-speed taxi runs down the length of the runway. Noting no abnormalities, he ultimately elected to depart on the accident flight.During the climb, while about 200 feet above the ground, the pilot noted that the airplane's engine did not seem to be producing enough power. He elaborated that the engine continued to sound normal, but he felt as if its power output was slowly decreasing over the course of about 10 seconds. Due to the small size of the tachometer, he was unable to determine if the engine rpm had changed. With the airplane descending, the pilot chose a cornfield as a forced landing site, as there was no safe area straight ahead, nor did he feel the airplane had enough altitude to return to the runway. During the approach for landing, the airplane slowed, entered an aerodynamic stall, and impacted the cornfield, resulting in serious injury to the pilot and substantial damage to the airplane.An examination of the airplane's engine was scheduled for a later date.",

After conducting a touch-and-go landing on runway 24, with more than 1,638 feet of runway ahead, the pilot turned the airplane right and advised the controller that he had a partial loss of engine power and intended to land on runway 13.  Near the approach end of runway 13, the pilot banked left, stalled, pitched nose down, and impacted the ground within 157 feet of the runway threshold. A witness reported that the engine was running rough but not sputtering. Another witness stated that the engine was not developing full power, and an airframe and powerplant mechanic reported that the engine sounded as if it were operating between 1,200 and 1,300 rpm.Examination of the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Examination of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction of the power train, air induction, or fuel metering systems; however, postaccident testing of the spark plugs revealed that five exhibited weak spark, which would have been detected during an engine run-up before takeoff.About the time of the accident, the temperature and dew point were favorable for serious icing at glide power. The engine sounds described by the witnesses are consistent with carburetor icing, as is the pilot\u2019s report of a partial loss of power after operating at a reduced power setting in the traffic pattern and then advancing the power after the touch-and-go landing. It could not be determined why the pilot did not elect to land the airplane on the remaining runway ahead.",

The lower magnetic chip detector contained a substantial amount of metallic particles, subsequently identified as material from the No. 5 bearing.  The particles did bridge the gap from anode to cathode.  A detailed examination of the engine determined that three sections of the first stage turbine wheel separated.  The stub shaft also fractured and separated, and a portion of the fractured tie bolt remained in the wheel.  Metallurgical examination of the first and second stage turbine wheels found evidence of gamma prime solutioning and localized melting of the second stage turbine wheel airfoil tips, indicating temperature exposures above 2,100 degrees Farenheit, a temperature range outside the normal operating envelope of these wheels.  This exposure to elevated temperatures resulted in rim separation due to thermal fatigue initiating at the rim followed by accelerated interdendritic creep crack growth.  No evidence of an oil fire was associated with the first stage wheel separation.  The composition, hardness, and microstructure of the first stage turbine wheel were as required by the engineering drawing.  The No. 5 bearing exhibited heat distress, but the cause of this could not be conclusively determined.  According to Rolls-Royce Allison, the internal evidence of excessive thermal damage to the first and second stage turbine wheels was consistent with prior examples of known hot starts.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power due to thermal fatigue failure of the first stage turbine wheel resulting in release of a section of its rim.  The thermal fatigue was due to the engine exceeding its temperature limits during one or more start cycles."

During a cross-country flight the engine began to run rough and the pilot diverted to Concord.  He phoned the FBO he rented the airplane from and advised them of the problem.  The company contacted another maintenance facility at Concord who found a broken exhaust valve in the number 2 cylinder.  The Concord maintenance facility estimated the repair job at 20 labor hours and the rental company declined to use them.  The company dispatched a mechanic to Concord to make the repairs.  The company mechanic replaced the number 2 cylinder and piston; however, he replaced the correct low compression piston with an incorrect high compression piston.  He performed the work in just 3 hours.  He failed to conduct a complete inspection of the engine for the missing pieces of the exhaust valve.

The airplane was trucked back to the originating airfield, and the pilot spent the rest of the afternoon trying to troubleshoot the problem.  He replaced the fuel filter, pulled and checked the spark plugs, and hand-turned the engine numerous times.  On the day of the accident, the pilot refueled the airplane, and took off on a test flight.  Just after takeoff, the engine failed again.  The pilot immediately lowered the nose of the airplane to gain airspeed.  He then looked for a field, but could only see trees.  The last thing he remembered, was making a turn, for about 160 degrees.  Post-accident engine examination revealed piston and cylinder wall scrapings, consistent with a 'cold seizure', resulting from a thermal imbalance.

Several witnesses near the runway were actively watching both airplanes and reported hearing abnormal sounds as the accident airplane passed them at mid-field. One witness described the noise as obviously being a propeller overspeed and the airplane's vertical climb speed seemed to be slower than normal.The flight instructor reported that after takeoff he joined in on the right side of the accident airplane and heard the accident pilot make one radio transmission that his \"rpm was at 3,500\".

The specialist advised the pilot that there was a weather front across his route of flight, and along the route, there were IFR conditions and moderate icing below 10,000 feet. The specialist also noted that later along the route, there would be another area of icing up to 22,000 feet. The pilot subsequently changed the en route altitude to 13,000 feet.

The pilot reported feeling a shudder, hearing a loud bang, and observing a fire ball coming from the right engine during landing gear extension. Postflight inspection revealed an exit hole in the inboard side of the right engine cowling. There was a similar sized penetration in the right wing above and inboard of the cowling hole. A rupture was found on the left side of the engine plenum case, in line with the airframe damage. The appearance of the case and the corresponding cowling and wing penetrations indicated that a single, high-energy rotor fragment had exited the engine case in an upward and slightly forward trajectory. Although the 2nd stage turbine wheel was not recovered, the physical evidence, including the axial location of the rupture, the intact condition of the 1st stage turbine wheel, and the absence of multiple case penetrations, suggested that a 4 to 5-inch piece of rim material separated from the 2nd stage turbine wheel and exited the side of the engine. According to Honeywell, a rim fragment separating from the 2nd stage turbine wheel will typically lack the energy for a direct radial release, and the engine structure showed marks and damage consistent with a released 2nd stage rim fragment striking the 3rd stage turbine stator assembly forward rib support casting and deflecting forward to exit at the rupture location between the 1st and 2nd stage turbine planes of rotation. The heavy curvic teeth smearing damage indicated gapping at the rotor curvic connections during operation, a severe condition that will result from gross rotor mass unbalance, such as the unbalance that results from the loss of a section of turbine wheel rim material. The shaft separation in plane with the 2nd stage turbine wheel curvics is also consistent with a rotor mass unbalance at the 2nd stage turbine wheel. The extensive non-uniform rotational damage is consistent with the loss of centering and the loss of operating clearances resulting from severe rotor unbalance and sudden shaft separation during operation.Honeywell\u2019s materials analysis suggested that a section of wheel rim material separated as the result of low cycle fatigue (LCF) cracks originating at the 2nd stage turbine wheel stress-reduction \"rivet\" holes,and that fatigue cracks progressed to failure from long term exposure to excessive temperatures. Rivet hole fatigue cracks as a rim separation failure mode was not confirmed, as only a small amount of 2nd stage turbine wheel material was recovered, and examination of these fragments found no evidence of LCF. Although rivet hole fatigue cracks do not normally progress to failure withing wheel life limits, elevated operating temperatures will contribute to crack growth. Moderate to severe thermal damage was observed in the engine's other turbine components with similar time in service, and the metallurgical evidence supported a finding that 2nd stage turbine vane airfoils were exposed short term to temperatures exceeding 2000 degrees F.

Air traffic control (ATC) personnel initially provided the pilot with headings to a nearby airport. However, when the pilot realized that he would not reach the intended airport, he deployed the airplane\u2019s parachute, and the airplane came to rest upright in a field.  Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the camshaft was completely fractured due to fatigue cracks near the flange at the oiling holes. Further examination showed that the fatigue cracks initiated at the edge of the oiling holes and were caused by burrs left when the camshaft was originally manufactured. The burrs folded over during subsequent shot-peening operations, which formed laps at the corners of the holes; the laps acted to concentrate stresses at the edges of the holes and also shielded the underlying material during shot peening. The laps prevented formation of the beneficial compressive stresses that result from shot peening. This allowed subsequent formation of fatigue cracks. The accident camshaft was determined to have been the 19th camshaft of its type manufactured. Because the camshaft was not a serialized part, specific manufacturing records could not be located. However, the quality control inspection procedures that were in place at the time the camshaft was manufactured required an inspection of the oil holes for proper de-burring.

The final radar targets depicted a descent and were clustered approximately over the crash site, 1 mile west of the departure airport. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact mechanical anomalies.

The pilot was reported to be flying the airplane to an airport in order to have maintenance work performed on the right engine due to a boost problem.  It was reported that the pilot had another mechanic at another airport look at the airplane.  A work order for a transient airplane was found that indicated work performed on the right engine turbocharger system about 1 month before the accident.  The work order shows that the wastegate oil filter was found clogged and collapsed and that it was cleaned, straightened and reinstalled.  The pilot operated the airplane with a right engine boost problem.  The boost problem with the right engine is evidenced by the previous work order, the excessive amount of runway used during takeoff, the reported smoke from the right engine after takeoff, and the airplane not climbing as expected after takeoff.  Due to the reduced power from the right engine, the pilot was required to apply left brake in order to maintain directional control during takeoff, as evidenced by the blued left brake disk with metal transfer into the relief holes and slots.  As a result of the pilot using left brake during takeoff, a fire erupted in the left wheel well, which spread to the aft fuselage.  This is evidenced by the sooting, fire, and heat damage to the wheel well, the carpet above the wheel well, and aft fuselage.

Upon reaching the limits of his search area he reversed course to return to home base.  On the return leg he decided to search an area where he had noticed two law enforcement airboats operating north of the port of entry.  The pilot reported on the Pilot/Operator Accident Report Form (NTSB Form 6120.1/2), that he recalled seeing two sets of power lines on the outbound leg of his patrol.  After crossing the first set of power lines and locating the airboats he began a turn to orbit the boats.  The pilot added that when he looked up and saw that he was about to hit the second set of wires, he instinctly initiated a cyclic climb to clear the wires; however, the maneuver was initiated too late and the tail rotor impacted the wires resulting in the separation of the tail rotor gear box, tail rotor assembly, and vertical fin.  The pilot managed to keep the helicopter in controlled flight and elected to execute an autorotation to a clearing.  The helicopter made a successful autorotation and landed upright in the middle of the river, 853 feet from the point of the wire strike.  The helicopter came to rest in about 3 feet of water, and the pilot performed an emergency engine shutdown and egressed through the pilot door with assistance from the crews of the airboats.",

The pilot then got into the airplane.  The airplane was towed out and the tow bar removed.  About two minutes later, the engines started.  Less than five minutes after the engines started, the airplane taxied.  The NTSB Audio Laboratory reviewed radio communications between ATCT and the pilot to determine from the speech evidence the pilot's level of psychological stress and workload.  The examination indicated the pilot's speech characteristics were consistent with an increased stress/workload that might accompany a developing emergency.  Referring to the pilot's final transmissions, \"His unusually long reaction time suggests that he was distracted by competing cockpit priorities and/or was having a difficult time determining his answer, while his fast speech and microphone keying provide further evidence of an urgency to return to other cockpit activities.\"  The report states that the pilot's statements remained rational and showed good word choice and grammar.  \"These factors, along with the relatively small change in fundamental frequency, suggest that the pilot did not reach an extreme level of stress.\" ",

The flight crew reported an engine fire warning, discharged a fire suppression bottle and diverted where a successful single engine landing was performed. The airplane taxied to the gate where all the passengers deplaned. There were no reported injuries. Preliminary examination of the engine revealed sooting on the engine cases from the compressor aft flange to approximately six inches beyond the turbine rear frame aft flange, but no significant thermal damage. Detailed examination of the engine revealed that the lower, most forward of the four bolts that secure the fuel manifold cover to the fuel manifold was missing while the other three had low torque values. Due to the missing attachment bolt and low torque on the three remaining bolts a gap between the two surfaces occurred that allowed fuel to leak. A review of photographs taken before the engine was released from the Celma overhaul shop reveals that all four bolts were present at that time, but based on the torque values during the investigation, they were likely not properly torqued at overhaul. These original low torque values allowed the bolts to back out over time until one eventually fell out. Pressurized fuel within the cavity was then able to pry the loose-fitting fuel manifold cover open at the location of the missing bolt and leak past its integral packing, creating the leak and subsequent in-flight fire. Examination of other 737 airplanes with CFM56-7B24 engines revealed no broader field problem.",
            "probable_cause": "The probable cause of the undercowl in-flight engine fire was the insufficient installation torque of the bolts that secure the fuel manifold cover to the fuel manifold.  Engine vibrations and fuel pressure cycles caused the bolts to gradually loosen further until one bolt lost all its tightening torque and fell out. The internal fuel pressure then forced open the fuel manifold cover at the location of the missing bolt, causing a gap between the two mating surfaces which allowed fuel to push past the integral packing, resulting in a fuel leak onto the hot engine cases where it ignited resulting in a fire."

During the flight to the second fuel stop, the engine lost fuel pressure, and the airplane impacted trees during a forced landing on a road.  Seven days before the accident flight, the airplane was topped off with fuel, and was flown in the area for about a 15 minute flight.  The flight departed at about 0720, they landed at the first fuel stop at about 0920, and refueled the airplane with 20 gallons of fuel.  He estimated that he had a total of 45 gallons of usable fuel on board for the flight to the second fuel stop.  He stated that he would make a decision after 2 hours into the flight to determine if they would require a stop for fuel before reaching the second fuel stop, at a fuel consumption of 10 gallons per hour.  He forecasted the flight to be 4 hours.  Twenty minutes into the flight to the second fuel stop, they stopped at the Moore County Airport for a restroom stop, and departed at about 1130.  During the engine run-up check for departure, he noted that he failed to reset the timer to monitor the fuel when he departed the first fuel stop.  He reset the timer and made a mental note to include approximately 30 minutes extra when figuring the fuel status en route.  At about 1530, about 12 miles from the second fuel stop, the pilot noted a loss of fuel pressure.  He switched tanks, turned on the fuel pump, enriched the fuel mixture, and about 2 minutes later the fuel pressure was lost again.  He advised Jacksonville Approach Control of his intentions to land on a road or in a field.  A road was located and he glided the airplane to land.    He noticed a gate along the landing path and maneuvered the airplane over the gate.  As the airplane came back down, the left wing struck trees resulting in the airplane rotating counter clockwise before coming to a stop.  He and the passenger exited the airplane, and called Flight Service to advise the authorities of what had happened.  According to the passenger, they departed after 11:15 am from the Moore Airport that day. While en route, at about 3:00 pm, the engine sputtered as if it was running out of fuel. The pilot switched from the left fuel tank to the right fuel tank and mentioned that they had enough fuel for a four hour trip, and that the right tank would be more than enough to get them to the airport. He had been regularly switching tanks during the flight. A few minutes later the engine sputtered again. The pilot said \"this can't be happening; we have enough fuel for 4 hours\".

The captain reported that the aircraft began a sudden and hard uncommanded 2g pull-up, with the control yoke moving rapidly aft. He immediately grabbed the control yoke, disengaged the autopilot, and leveled the aircraft.  Three flight attendants in the aft galley and one passenger in an aft lavatory sustained serious injuries.  The aft galley flight attendants described the onset of the event as 'being pulled to the floor by what felt like a strong pull of gravity.'  The force suddenly reversed and the three were 'thrown up into the ceiling.'  Another force reversal followed and the three were 'slammed down against the floor.'  The flight attendants said that a 'roller coaster' type movement then occurred, which quickly damped into a steady state.  Review of the aircraft's maintenance records for the year preceding the accident revealed over 50 discrepancies for autopilot system uncommanded disconnects, uncommanded pitch-ups, and failures to engage.  Review of the DFDR data revealed that as the aircraft passed through 29,200 feet, four pitch cycles were recorded over a 15-second time period and were accompanied by vertical accelerations, the most severe of which was between 1.84 and -0.12 g's.  The initial uncommanded nose pitch-up was preceded by an autopilot controlled movement of the left inboard elevator.  The subsequent elevator movements and resultant pitch excursions were due to the pilot's control inputs.  With the exception of the captain's and first officer's control wheel sensor units, all autopilot systems passed functional checks.  Postaccident test of the first officer's control wheel sensor unit showed an out of tolerance and drifting null signal for the strain gage which provides pitch signal input to the No. 1 autopilot.  After about 3 minutes, the signal became noisy and jumped to values of up to 4 volts several times.  Many spikes were also observed at values under 3.5 volts (signals over 3.5 volts trigger an automatic disengagement of the autopilot). Subsequent examination of the pitch strain gages by optical magnification found a foreign black-gray metallic-like substance bridging the terminal lug ends.  Analysis showed the material was a silver based conductive substance, lying below a factory applied sealing layer, which was introduced during manufacture.  The solder on the lugs and the wire used between the lugs and terminals was found not to be consistent with the manufacturer's specifications. ",

Cracks were found on N9K in 1997 and repairs were made in accordance with Extra instructions.  Revision 'B' was then issued calling for the same repairs that the operator had already made if cracks were found.  When Revision 'C' was issued it called for the same type of repair, but the gusset to be used was shaped differently and was larger.

Most of these observations occurred when the airplane flew over several lakes in the local area. The airplane returned to the origination airport for landing about 1/2 hour after its departure. Instead of flying a normal airport traffic pattern, the pilot flew along the runway in the direction opposite of his intended landing direction, at an altitude of approximately 100 feet above the ground.

Witnesses who held pilot certificates were on a mountain top at 7,900 feet and saw a cloud layer as far to the south as they could see.  They used visual cues to estimate that the cloud tops were around 5,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  They noted that the clouds did not extend all the way up into the mountain canyons; the clouds broke up near the head of some canyons.  When they first saw the airplane, they assumed that it came from above the clouds.  It was proceeding north up a canyon near the edge of clouds, which were breaking up.  They were definitely looking down at the airplane the whole time.  They saw the airplane make a 180-degree turn that was steeper than a standard rate turn.  The wings leveled and the airplane went through one cloud, reappeared briefly, and then entered the cloud layer.  It appeared to be descending when they last saw it.  About 2 minutes later, they saw the top of the cloud layer bulge and turn a darker color.  The bulge began to subside and they observed several smaller bulges appear.  They notified local authorities that they thought a plane was down.  Searchers discovered the wreckage at that location and reported that the wreckage and surrounding vegetation were on fire.  The initial responders reported that the area was cloudy and the visibility was low.  Examination of the ground scars and wreckage debris path disclosed that the airplane collided with the canyon walls in controlled flight on a westerly heading of 260 degrees at an elevation of 3,400 feet msl.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot stated that the flight departed with 120 gallons of usable fuel on-board, and approximately 1 hour into the flight while flying between 2,000 and 2,500 feel mean sea level with fuel being supplied from the main fuel tank, he turned on the boost pump and the fuel selector for the larger fuel tank (auxiliary fuel tank).  The flight continued and approximately 30-45 minutes later with both fuel tank on/off valves \"on\", the engine experienced a loss of power.  He applied carburetor heat but engine power was not restored.  He maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing on an east/west oriented dirt road, but recognized that he would be unable to land on the road due to trees.  He set up for landing south of and parallel to the dirt road.  While descending, the left wing collided with a tree approximately 20 feet above ground level.  He did not recall any other part of the accident but remembers waking up and exiting the airplane.  Examination of the airplane at the scene by an FAA airworthiness inspector revealed the original fuel tank installed when the airplane was manufactured was empty, and an aluminum fuel tank installed in place of the hopper tank was full.  Examination of the cockpit revealed yellow colored placards with black letters by the 2 fuel on/off valves that indicated usable fuel quantity, orientation in terms of position, i.e. \"push-on\" and \"pull-off\"; there was no placard that indicated both should not be on at the same time.  Check valves which were oriented properly in terms of flow direction were installed at the outlets of both fuel tanks; both check valves were removed for further examination.  Examination of the check valves was performed with FAA oversight at a military installation with calibrated equipment.  The check valve from the original fuel tank was found to open at less than 1/4 psi, but the check valve from the auxiliary fuel tank was found to open at 3/4 psi.  Review of the maintenance records revealed an entry dated May 25, 2003, which indicates the mechanic removed all optional agricultural equipment and installed a 77-gallon aluminum fuel tank and boost pump in place of the hopper tank.  The entry references a FAA 337 form, and that all work was performed in accordance with the airplane type certificate data sheet and flight manual, and Advisory Circular 43.132A.  The mechanic who signed off the logbook entry for the 77-gallon aluminum tank installation stated the installation into the accident airplane was based on a previous installation of the same system another mechanic had done to an airplane he owned.  The previous installation included stainless steel check valves at the outlet of both fuel tanks and the new owner of the airplane wanted them installed as well.  The check valves that were installed were purchased from a Yacht company.  As part of the installation in the accident airplane, the mechanic stated that he installed a placard by the fuel on/off valves which indicated that both should not be opened at the same time.  Following the installation, the engine was operated with fuel being supplied only from the auxiliary fuel tank and the engine driven fuel pump operating.  Static testing showed that with fuel in the fuel tank and the fuel line disconnected downstream of the check valve, but only a trickle of fuel was noted.  He questioned that with the representative of the company where he purchased the check valves and the response was that was normal.  Further testing with pressure applied to the tank revealed fuel flowed from the disconnected line.  Additionally, he stated the pilot had asked him if it was acceptable to have both on/off valves \"on\" at the same time, and he advised the pilot it was not.  Both he and the pilot checked the main fuel tank before the accident flight departed and both noted that the fuel level was down 2-3 inches which he estimated was 4-5 gallons less than full.  According to the FAA inspector-in-charge, the installation of the 77-gallon fabricated fuel tank (auxiliary tank) was performed without FAA approved data.  He also stated that the airplane flight manual (AFM) did not have a supplement indicating how to operate the auxiliary fuel tank system.",
            "probable_cause": "The insufficient information provided to the pilot by the mechanic that installed the auxiliary fuel tank for his failure to install a placard to indicate that both fuel on/off valves should not be on at the same time resulting in a total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.  Also, the unsuitable terrain encountered by the pilot during the forced landing.  Findings in the investigation was the installation by the mechanic of FAA check valves into the airplane purchased at a yacht company, and modification of the airplane by the mechanic without FAA approval."

Maintenance checked the pump but could not duplicate the intermittent discrepancy and the airplane was approved for return to service. Shortly after takeoff during the accident flight while operating with the crossfeed switch in the \"Auto\" position, the left boost pump became inoperative and the \"Fuel Crossfeed\" annunciator correctly illuminated alerting the flightcrew that the right boost pump was supplying fuel from the right fuel tanks to both engines. An adequate supply of fuel was available in the left fuel tanks which could have directly supplied the left engine had the flightcrew closed the crossfeed valve, but the pilot in command (PIC) continued the flight with fuel only supplied from the right fuel tanks. While descending, both engines lost power due to fuel starvation. The PIC maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing in an open field and landed hard, bounced, and came to rest upright. Postaccident inspection of the airplane revealed internal components of the left boost pump were worn resulting in an inoperative boost pump and the right no fuel transfer time delay relay was inoperative due to a broken terminal at the relay. Had the right no fuel transfer annunciation system been operative, it is likely that the flightcrew would have diverted earlier for an uneventful landing at a suitable airport. While inspection of the electrical wiring and components in the cockpit (includes the fuel control panel) occurs during a Phase 3 inspection required to be performed every 800 hours, the failures of the wires and terminal at the right no fuel transfer time delay relay was due to bending which occurred with repeated opening and closing of the panel.

The controller cleared the airplane to flight level 210 and gave the pilot permission to deviate east of the airplane's route to avoid weather and traffic. A review of radar data showed the airplane heading southward away from the departure airport and climbing to an altitude of about 14,800 feet mean sea level (msl). Shortly thereafter, the airplane turned north, and the controller queried the pilot about the turn; however, he did not respond. The airplane wreckage was located on ranch land with sections of the airplane's outer wing, engines, elevators, and vertical and horizontal stabilizers separated from the fuselage and scattered in several directions, which is consistent with an in-flight breakup before impact with terrain. A review of the weather information for the airplane's route of flight showed widely scattered thunderstorms and a southerly surface wind of 30 knots with gusts to 40 knots. An AIRMET active at the time advised of moderate turbulence below flight level 180. Three pilot reports made within 50 miles of the accident site indicated moderate turbulence and mountain wave activity. An assessment of the humidity and freezing level noted the potential for clear, light-mixed, or rime icing between 10,700 and 17,300 feet msl. Postaccident airplane examination did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with the airframe and engines that would have precluded normal operation.

No previous control problems had been reported to have occurred since the airplane was delivered new. Review of the incident airplane's maintenance records did not reveal any previous control problems or any re-rigging of its flight control system since delivery. At the time of the incident, the airplane had accumulated 509 total hours in service. Examination of the airplane revealed that with simultaneous full left aileron and full right rudder inputs, the rudder-aileron interconnect (RAI) arm captured the forward RAI bungee clamp, and locked the yaw and roll controls. The airplane was configured in accordance with the existing design, manufacturing and maintenance guidance and procedures. During the investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board was also notified of an occurrence of control interference with another SR-20, and instances of RAI bungee cord slippage through the bungee cord clamps, which could result in increased roll control input forces or adverse effects on the operation of the aileron trim system. Evidence indicated that the existing design and rigging guidance was insufficient to prevent control interference and clamp slippage. The manufacturer issued a mandatory service bulletin which changed the rigging procedures and RAI hardware. During the course of the investigation, the service bulletin was revised three times as safety information was garnered from airplane examinations and bungee testing.
