During the takeoff roll about halfway down the runway, the control yoke pushed back against the pilot's hand and the nose wheel came up off the runway.  The pilot then applied forward pressure on the control yoke while checking the airspeed indicator.  The pilot noticed that the airspeed was in the \"green range,\" and released some of the forward pressure that she had applied to the yoke.

Arriving in the Hyannis Airport area, at night, the crew received the ATIS, which stated that winds were from 040 degrees at 20 knots, gusts to 33 knots.  The ILS Runway 15 approach was in use.  Braking action was reported poor by a Cessna 402, and all surfaces were covered with a patchy thin layer of snow and ice.  The PIC determined that the tailwind component for the ILS Runway 15 approach would have exceeded the airplane's limitations, and requested the ILS Runway 24 approach.  The airplane touched down about 2,640 feet beyond the approach end of the 5,425-foot long runway.  The airplane impacted the localizer antenna, departed the end of the runway, went through a chain link fence, crossed a two-lane road, struck three vehicles on the road, continued into a parking lot, and impacted concrete barriers and two parked vehicles.  Examination of the airplane revealed a takeoff and landing card (TOLD) on the instrument panel.  Written on the card was the landing distance calculated as 3,050 feet and a notation of 'BA POOR'.  At the time of the accident the runway was covered with a 1/2-inch accumulation of ice and snow.  According to the Dassault DA-900 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Limitations Section, the maximum allowable tailwind component at landing was 10 knots.  According to the DA-900 Performance Manual, the maximum safe crosswind on icy runways was 5 knots.  The manual also stated, 'For icy runway conditions, landing distance is 3 times the landing distance on dry runway.'  Using the factor of 3 and a 10 knot tailwind, a landing distance was computed to be about 10,800 feet.  No factors were published for a 20 knot tailwind. ",
            "probable_cause": "The flightcrew's inadequate coordination and improper weather evaluation.  Also causal was the captain's improper decision to continue the approach to a runway with insufficient length and his failure to obtain the proper touch down point on the runway.  Factors in the accident were the tailwind conditions and the ice and snow-covered runway."

The Cessna 206 pilot stated that he was maneuvering for landing after completing a right 270-degree turn, which positioned the airplane for a left downwind approach for landing to the northeast. The Cessna 180 was flying northbound and presumably also on a left downwind approach for landing to the northeast. The airplanes were about 900 feet above ground level when the collision occurred. The pilot of the Cessna 206 said he saw the Cessna 180 approaching from the right, and he made an immediate climbing left turn just before the collision.

While climbing through 9,000 feet mean sea level (msl) the pilot leaned the airplane by relying solely on the exhaust gas temperature gauge.  When reaching about 9,500 feet msl, about 1,500 feet above ground level over mountainous terrain, the pilot reported that the engine lost partial power.  The propeller continued to turn, and the tachometer showed about 2,450 to 2,500 rpm, but the engine failed to produce enough power to sustain level flight.  The pilot adjusted the mixture control, while also turning the carburetor heat to the on position, and applying full throttle.  The engine failed to respond and the pilot made an approach to a sandy beach.  The pilot flared the airplane about 2 feet above ground level, and the left wing collided with a tree stump, veering the airplane to the right.  The elevation at the crash site was about 7,600 feet msl.  A post accident investigation revealed that the left magneto exhibited excessive play at the cam end (points) of the main shaft.  The subject magneto was later functionally tested, which revealed an intermittent spark on ignition lead T1.  According to Textron Lycoming Mandatory Service Bulletin 515 the magnetos must be inspected every 500 hours.  At the time of the accident, the magneto had accumulated a total time in service of 1,540.23 hours, and there was no maintenance entry indicating that the Service Bulletin had been complied with.  While post accident tests showed that the left magneto was working only on an intermittent basis, information provided by Lycoming suggests that in and of itself the complete loss of one magneto would only result in a 3 to 5 percent loss of power.  It is likely that the combined effects of the magneto malfunction, the high density altitude, and the pilot's manipulation of the mixture and carburetor heat all played roles in the engine's decreased performance capability.",

Analysis of global positioning system data showed that the pilot initiated a takeoff from the runway and prior to reaching an altitude of 100 feet, he began turning the airplane on course to the destination airport. After crossing over the left boundary of the runway and with the airplane oriented toward a non-lighted area of the landmass and water below, the airplane ceased climbing and impacted trees about 900 feet beyond the left boundary of the runway. The wreckage path orientation and length were consistent with a shallow, powered descent, and signatures observed on the wreckage were consistent with a relatively level impact attitude. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions of the airframe or engine.Toxicological analysis detected elevated levels of ethanol in postmortem samples of the pilot\u2019s blood, urine, and brain tissue, the distribution of which was consistent with ingestion. The levels of ethanol present in the pilot\u2019s samples were present in levels known to degrade psychomotor performance. Toxicological testing also detected an inactive metabolite of cocaine in postmortem samples of the pilot\u2019s urine, but not in samples of blood. This was a likely indication that the pilot had used cocaine, but neither the drug nor its metabolite was active at the time of the accident.The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot experiencing a form of spatial disorientation known as the somatogravic illusion, in which a pilot misperceives acceleration cues as increasing pitch and makes corrective nose-down inputs. These circumstances include the accelerating phase of flight during takeoff, the dark night lighting conditions associated with an early turn on course, and a non-instrument-rated pilot whose judgment and psychomotor performance were degraded by alcohol consumption. The airplane subsequently impacted the trees and terrain below in a shallow, un-arrested descent.",

The pilot was fatally injured and the two medical crewmembers sustained serious injuries. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Eagle Med, LLC; Wichita, Kansas. Dark night visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and a company visual flight rules flight plan had been filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 helicopter emergency medical service positioning flight. The helicopter departed from St. Francis Hospital Heliport (4OK3); Tulsa, Oklahoma, about 2248, and was destined for McAlester Regional Airport (MLC), McAlester, Oklahoma.During the previous northbound flight to transport a patient to the 4OK3 heliport, the pilot mentioned to the medical crew that he noticed that the clouds above their cruise altitude were lower than he expected. The pilot descended slightly and the helicopter landed at 4OK3 without incident. While on the ground the pilot checked weather again and after conferring with the medical crew they decided to begin the planned return flight from 4OK3 to MLC. The helicopter was southbound at a cruise altitude of about 1,500 feet msl when the medical crew reported the helicopter had twice briefly entered and exited instrument meteorological conditions. After a short discussion the pilot then stated he was going to divert, and he began a left turn to return to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Soon after beginning the left turn the helicopter impacted trees and terrain at a surface elevation of about 850 feet msl. The impact resulted in the separation of the tail boom and portions of the fuselage and the main wreckage came to rest on its right side. The helicopter's fuel tank remained intact, there was no fuel leak, and there was no postimpact fire.After impact the surviving medical crewmembers extracted themselves from the wreckage and immediately made a cell phone call to report their situation and location. Several agencies then used the position report from the crew, data from the on-board GPS position reporting system, and signals from the 406 MHz emergency locator transmitter to locate the wreckage. Emergency responders hiked in the dark night conditions through the remote rugged terrain and arrived several hours later.A meteorological reporting station was located at Okmulgee Regional Airport (OKM) in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, about 20 miles north-northwest of the accident location at an elevation of approximately 720 feet. An automated weather report from OKM at 2315 indicated wind from 020 degrees at 3 knots, visibility of 10 statute miles or greater, ceiling broken at 2,400 feet above ground level (agl), broken cloud layer base at 3,000 feet agl, temperature of 12 degrees C and a dew point temperature of 11 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.13 inches of Mercury. Prior to this report, the lowest cloud layer had been reported as being at or above 5,000 feet agl since 2015, except for 2255, when the lowest cloud layer was reported as being scattered at 1,100 feet agl.A meteorological reporting station was located at McAlester Regional Airport (MLC) in McAlester, Oklahoma,about 28 miles south of the accident location at an elevation of 770 feet. Beginning at 2153 and continuing through the accident time, MLC automated reporting indicated the lowest cloud bases were between 900 and 2,100 feet agl.

The accident airplane had not flown in a year, nor had there been any entries in the maintenance logbooks in the last four years; it did not have a current condition inspection recorded in the logbooks. The mechanic said that he had been in the process of installing an intake oil drain kit, which drains oil from the lower 3 cylinders from a common quick drain. The mechanic said that the project was not complete, but it had progressed to the point that he had put new oil in the engine. On the morning of the accident, the pilot had to move the airplane out from the back of the hangar and install the engine cowling before flight. He flew to the airport where the fly-in was being held and landed without incident. On his return flight, as he approached the airport, he radioed the tower controller and said that his engine was running rough. Approximately two minutes later, he said that his engine had lost power, and he was going down.  A witness on the ground said that he heard a loud bang and looked up to see blue-gray smoke coming from the airplane.  Another witness said she saw the airplane making a low left turn, when it flipped inverted and spiraled to the ground. The airplane impacted in a residential area, approximately 15 feet behind a home. A post impact fire consumed the airplane. During an engine teardown, a cylinder was removed and significant heat distress was found on and around the main rod bearing. The main rod bearing was plastically deformed and broken; several connecting rods were bent and/or broken. Additionally, a heavy oil coating was found all along the bottom of the fuselage and most of the empennage was covered with oil. If the pilot had performed an adequate preflight before his return flight, it is likely that he would have noticed a significant loss of engine oil.",

The corroded platform area of the compressor turbine blades contained foreign elements mostly composed of phosphate and lead oxide.

Recorded data recovered from the airplane revealed that about 40 minutes into the flight, the airplane reached its highest recorded altitude of 7,847 feet mean sea level (msl). At this time, the airplane was about 4 miles from a mountain ridge directly ahead, the lowest point of which was 8,470 feet msl, with terrain elevations of more than 9,000 feet msl on both sides. The airplane\u2019s recovered electronic data revealed that the airplane\u2019s stall warning system activated about 3 minutes before the accident and remained on for most of the remaining recorded data. The data indicated that the airplane rolled steeply to the left, briefly recovered and pitched up 10 to 15 degrees, and then rolled to the left in a nearly 67-degree inverted nose-down attitude before impacting terrain. Postaccident calculations indicated that at the time of the accident, the airplane was likely being flown close to the airplane\u2019s stall speed. \u00a0The pilot, who had rented the airplane, had extensive rotorcraft/helicopter flight experience but had accumulated only about 160 hours total flight time in fixed wing airplanes, with about 17 hours in the accident airplane make and model. The pilot\u2019s most recent flight in the make and model of the accident airplane took place about 18 months before the accident flight. \u00a0Postaccident interviews with personnel from the company that rented the airplane revealed that, on a previous occasion, the pilot had been observed overloading the airplane and was advised that he could not take that much baggage on the flight. The company personnel further stated that on the morning of the accident, after the company fueled the airplane for the pilot\u2019s flight, the pilot taxied the airplane to another area on the airport where he loaded his passengers and baggage. This location was about 1/4 mile away and was not visible from the company\u2019s facility.

The first two flights were uneventful. The accident occurred during the third flight of the day.A review of the UNICOM radio communications revealed that, shortly after the airplanes took off, the accident pilot announced, \"canopy, canopy.\" The lead airplane pilot asked the accident pilot if he was heading back; the accident pilot's response could not be understood. The accident airplane subsequently made a right descending turn and impacted a berm in desert terrain at a high descent rate and then bounced about 200 feet before coming to rest about a 1/2 mile from the airport. The airplane came to rest between two sets of power lines next to an access road. First responders to the accident site reported that both of the airplane's canopies were closed and that the engine remained running for about 20 minutes before it shut down on its own.A postaccident examination of the airplane, engine, and forward and aft canopies revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. If one of the canopies had somehow become displaced, the canopy illumination warning light would have activated, and the pilot should have followed the emergency procedures, which state, in part, to land as soon as practical, and likely would have been able to control the airplane and land. The reason for the pilot's radio transmission about the canopy and his initiation of a right descending turn could be determined.",

The on-site investigation revealed that the engine crankshaft had fractured and the propeller had separated from the engine.  The propeller was never located and is believed to be in a nearby slough or a densely wooded area.  The fracture of the crankshaft and the cracking of the oil slinger flange were the result of an extreme load on the front of the engine pushing aft and offset from the crankshaft centerline.  Ground impact is the most likely source of the load.  The offset load created bending loads on the crankshaft that led to an overstress fracture of the crankshaft.  The aft loads pushed the crankshaft aft into the case, causing one side of the oil slinger flange to crack because it was restrained by the case.

            "narrative": "On January 26, 2015, at 1044 central standard time, a Cessna 182L airplane, N3181R, collided with trees during an off airport forced landing in Owen, Wisconsin. The certified flight instructor (CFI) received serious injuries, the student pilot received minor injuries, and the pilot rated passenger was fatally injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane had recently been purchased by the student pilot, but it was still registered to the previous owner. The airplane was operated by the owner as an instructional flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight originated from the Menominee-Marinette Twin county Airport (MNM), Menominee, Michigan at 0928 with an intended destination of the Litchfield Municipal Airport (LJF), Litchfield, Minnesota. The student pilot had purchased the airplane in Indiana and the purpose of the flight was to relocate the airplane to Fairbanks, Alaska. He stated that they stopped at MNM to obtain fuel. The pilot was in contact with the Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) while en route to LJF at 8,000 feet. The pilot requested a climb to 10,000 feet stating they were picking up rime ice. The pilot then reported that they were picking up \"quite a bit of rime ice\" at 10,000 feet and requested a descent back down to 8,000 feet. Approximately 3 minutes later, the pilot requested a descent to 6,000 feet stating that they were picking up more ice. The pilot then stated they had a little rise in the outside temperature, but were still \"building up quite a bit of ice\" and requested a descent to 4,000 feet which was approved. A short time later, the controller instructed the pilot to maintain 4,000 feet stating that the radar was showing him at 3,500 feet. The pilot replied that they were unable to maintain 4,000 feet. The controller provided the pilot with the weather conditions for nearby airports and asked the pilot if he wanted to change his destination. The pilot responded that they were looking up the weather for Eau Claire. The controller then issued an altitude alert to the pilot stating that the minimum IFR altitude in the area was 3,000 feet. The pilot reported they were going to stay at 2,500 feet where they had visual contact with the ground. The controller reported that radar contact was lost and issued a position report to the nearest airport. The controller declared an emergency for the pilot and asked what their intentions were. The pilot responded that they were going to divert to Eau Claire. The controller cleared the airplane to the Eau Claire airport and instructed them to maintain 3,000 feet when possible. The controller asked the pilot about the icing conditions and the pilot stated that they were not picking up ice at their current altitude. The controller asked the pilot how much fuel they had remaining and the pilot responded that they had 4 hours of fuel remaining. The controller issued a frequency change for another sector controller. There was no further contact with the airplane. The ARTCC lost radio communication with the airplane at 1044, 41 miles east of Eau Claire, WI.The student pilot told local authorities that they knew they were going to be flying into some weather, but they were planning on staying above it. He stated he was flying the airplane until the weather conditions deteriorated at which time the CFI began flying. He reported that the airplane's performance deteriorated and they were no longer able to maintain altitude so they decided to land on the road. He stated that the CFI had a small area between the size of a golf ball and a baseball in which he was able to see out of the windshield. The student pilot reported he could see about an inch of ice built up on the wing. He stated the airplane was \"running great\" prior to the accident. The CFI reported to local authorities that they were unable to get above the weather and that the airplane started icing up. He stated they made several altitude changes, but the ice continued to accumulate. He stated they were unable to maintain altitude and that the wings were no longer able to \"provide lift\" due to the ice accumulation. The airplane touched down to the east on a two-lane, paved country road. Tire tracks indicate the airplane was near the left edge of the road. The left wing contacted trees along the side of the road as evidenced by the left wing tip being found near the initial tree strikes. The airplane continued on the road where it contacted more trees prior to veering to the left and coming to rest in a group of trees.",

Several witnesses reported light rain was occurring at the time of the accident; there was no lightning or thunder.  One witness located where the airplane came to rest reported observing the airplane emerge from the base of the clouds in a 45-degree left wing low and 20 degrees nose low attitude.  He momentarily lost sight of the airplane but then noted it rolled to a wings level attitude.  He also reported hearing the engine(s) \"cutting in an out.\"  Another witness located approximately 1/4 mile north of the accident site observed the airplane flying eastbound beneath the clouds in a right wing and nose low attitude, he also reported hearing the engine(s) sounding like they were \"cutting in and out.\"  A pilot-rated witness located an estimated 1,000 feet from where the airplane came to rest estimated that the ceiling was at 300 feet and there was light drizzle.  He observed the airplane in a 45-degree angle of bank to the right and in a slight nose low attitude.  He stated that the airplane continued in that attitude before he lost sight of the airplane at 250 feet.  The airplane impacted trees then a concrete wall while in a nose and right wing low attitude.  The airplane then traveled through automobile hoists/lifts which were coverered by corrugated metal, and came to rest adjacent to a building of an automobile facility.  Impact and a postcrash fire destroyed the airplane, along with a building and several vehicles parked at the facility.  Examination of the airplane revealed the flaps were symmetrically retracted and landing gears were retracted.  No evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction was noted to the flight controls.  Examination of the engines revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction; impact and fire damage precluded testing of several engine accessories from both engines.  Examination of the propellers revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Parallel slash marks were noted in several of the corrugated metal panels that covered the hoists/lifts, the slashes were noted 25 and 21 inches between them.  According to the airplane manufacturer, the 25 inch distance between the propeller slashes corresponds to an airspeed of 123 knots.  Additionally, the power-off stall speed at the airplanes calculated weight with the flaps retracted and 48 degree angle of bank was calculated to be 122 knots.  Review of NTSB plotted radar data revealed that the pilot performed one 360-degree orbit to the left with varying angles of left bank and while flying initially at 1,300 feet, climbing to near 1,500 feet, then descending to approximately 800 feet.  The airplane continued in the left turn and between 1502:10 and 1502:27, the calibrated airspeed decreased from 160 to 100 knots.  At 1502:27, the bank angle was 48 degrees, and the angle of attack was 26 degrees.  Between 1502:30 and 1502:35, the true heading changed indicating a bank to the right.  The last plotted altitude was 200 feet, which occurred at 1502:35.  A NTSB weather study indicated that at the area and altitude the airplane was operating, NWS VIP level 1 to 2 echoes (light to moderate intensity) were noted.  Additionally, the terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) for the destination airport indicated that temporarily between 1400 and 1800 (the flight departed at approximately 1436 and the accident occurred at approximately 1503), visibility 5 miles with moderate rain showers, scattered clouds at 1,500 feet, and a broken ceiling at 3,000 feet.",

The witness also stated that the airplane departed runway 8 and climbed to about 200 feet above ground level (AGL).  He said the airplane then turned left 70 degrees and crashed onto runway 4.  The witness stated the engine thrust was decreasing. According to an FAA inspector, the airplane experienced a partial loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.  The pilot then stalled the airplane.  The inspector also stated the pilot had plenty of runway ahead of him as well as a grassy area available for landing. ",

The airplane touched down hard and bounced.  During the landing roll, the pilot applied 'maximum braking,' however, the airplane exited the departure end of the runway.  The nose landing gear sank in the soft mud and collapsed. Subsequently, the airplane came to rest on its nose.  During a post-accident examination of the engine, no anomalies were noted that would have prevented its operation. ",

The start, taxi and takeoff were normal.  During the climb, at about 150 feet AGL, the engine suddenly lost power.  The pilot was unable to return to the airport, therefore he chose to land on a Highway that parallels the airport.  The road was initially clear of traffic until a truck came over a rise.  The pilot maneuvered the aircraft to the side of the road and just before touch down, the left wing struck a tree which spun the aircraft to the left.  The main landing gear collapsed and the right wing contacted the surface.  After the accident, the pilot immediately exited the aircraft, then returned to secure the cockpit when it was safe.  The pilot found that the magneto switches, which are unguarded toggle switches located on the lower left side of the wall, were off.  The pilot reported that he did not recall turning off the switches prior to exiting the aircraft.  After the aircraft was moved back to the airport, the engine was started and run for several minutes with no evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction noted.",
            "probable_cause": "The magneto was inadvertently switched off by the pilot during the climb.  A tree was a factor."

The airstrip was not maintained and there was tall grass along the landing path. After landing, the pilot turned around and took off to the southwest.

After crossing the finish line, while banking left at the first set of pylons, the number two and number three airplanes collided. Race procedures were for the pilots to maintain power and airspeed, while climbing to enter a landing traffic pattern. According to the fourth place pilot, the number two airplane, a Smith Sonerai-I, N77TY, decelerated, pitched nose up, and collided with the number three airplane, a Shafer Sonerai-I, N20CS. During deceleration, the number two airplane was below number three, and it entered the 'blind area' of number three. The number three pilot did not maneuver to maintain visual contact with number two. The design of the FAA approved race course included a 500 foot safety zone between the flight path of the airplanes and the spectators. Wreckage of both airplanes came to rest outside the safety zone, where spectators could have positioned themselves. ",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.Shortly after takeoff, the airplane experienced electrical problems, including numerous tripped circuit breakers.  The flight crew requested a return to airport.  During the landing rollout, the lead flight attendant and air traffic control personnel reported to the flight crew that smoke was coming from the left side of the airplane; subsequently, the flight crew initiated an emergency evacuation on one of the taxiways.  Examination of the airplane revealed fire damage to the left, forward areas of the fuselage, cabin, and forward cargo compartment. The greatest amount of fire damage was found just aft of the electrical disconnect panel located at fuselage station 237.  There was no evidence that the drip shield normally installed over the disconnect panel was present at the time of the accident.  Bluish stains caused by lavatory rinse fluid were observed on surfaces near the disconnect panel on the accident airplane and in the same areas on another of AirTran's DC-9 airplanes.  Examination of one of the connectors from the disconnect panel on the accident airplane revealed light-blue and turquoise-green deposits on its internal surfaces and evidence of shorting between the connector pins.  It could not be determined when the drip shield over the disconnect panel was removed; however, this likely contributed to the lavatory fluid contamination of the connectors.  Following the accident, AirTran revised its lavatory servicing procedures to emphasize the importance of completely draining the waste tank to avoid overflows.  Boeing issued an alert service bulletin recommending that operators of DC-9 airplanes visually inspect the connectors at the FS 237 disconnect panel for evidence of lavatory rinse fluid contamination and that they install a drip shield over the disconnect panel.  Boeing also issued a service letter to operators to stress the importance of properly sealing floor panels and adhering to lavatory servicing procedures specified in its DC-9 Maintenance Manual.  The Safety Board is aware of two incidents involving the military equivalent of the DC-9 that involved circumstances similar to the accident involving N826AT.  Drip shields were installed above the FS 237 disconnect panels on both airplanes.   ",
            "probable_cause": "the leakage of lavatory fluid from the airplane's forward lavatory onto electrical connectors, which caused shorting that led to a fire.  Contributing to the accident were the inadequate servicing of the lavatory and the failure of maintenance to ensure reinstallation of the shield over the fuselage station 237 disconnect panel."
