The helicopter was over mountainous/hilly terrain and there was no open place to land. The pilot selected a spot on a steep hill covered with 20- to 30-foot-tall oak trees. Upon touchdown, the helicopter began to roll, but was stopped by the vegetation. The tailboom incurred structural damage during the landing. Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that the fuel pump filter bowl's upper drain plug had been replaced with a non-standard threaded nipple fitting and cap. This cap was found with zero torque (loose) and partially backed off of its seat. Less than two threads retained the cap on its fitting. In standard configuration, the upper and lower drain plugs are lock-wired to each other, thus ensuring both fittings remain properly torqued. On the accident engine, the lower drain plug was lock-wired to the upper drain's threaded nipple fitting. However, the cap was not lockwired. The fuel spray nozzle's fuel supply line was found to be devoid of any residual fuel. (This line would typically have about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of fuel following a normal engine shutdown.) The engine was removed from the airframe and shipped to the facilities of the engine manufacturer for a test run. The suspect loose cap was gently tightened with a wrench. The engine was then run and met all test cell parameters for new engine production. Since the fuel pump filter bowl operates at a negative pressure during operation, a compromise at this point in the fuel system would not result in a fuel leak, but would rather result in an air induction into the fuel system, interrupting the supply of fuel to the fuel spray nozzle.

According to the pilot, he was aware that on the 8th he was scheduled to work a nighttime shift, but he remained awake all day. He reported for work at 1930 to begin his nighttime shift. During his preflight inspection at the beginning of his shift, he noted that both the tail rotor and a main rotor blade were tied down. He stated that he went to sleep at 2300 after being awake for 15 hours. On April 9, after sleeping about 2 hours, he received a duty call about 0110 and was dispatched for the accident flight. During a walk-around inspection in the dark, he observed a flight nurse proceed to the opposite side of the helicopter. According to the pilot, he assumed that the flight nurse had untied the tail rotor tie-down strap. He only removed the main rotor blade's tie-down strap. The pilot's failure to ensure that the tail rotor blade's tie down was removed was an error of omission, indicative of fatigue impairment. During the engine start operation, the tail rotor's strap broke. This resulted in damage to a tail rotor blade and all of the pitch change links.

According to his logbook, this was the second time the pilot had made this type of trip, with the previous trip about 11 months prior. The purpose of the accident flight was to fly to another back country airport about 15 nautical miles to the north, have breakfast at a lodge, and then return. The pilot did not file a flight plan, and although the passenger thought other pilots knew their destination and intended time of return, this was not the case. The passenger stated that other airplanes departed first, and then they took off. She recalled that they were flying inside the canyon walls and made several turns.

About 10 seconds after the transition to forward flight, at 35 knots and between 150 to 200 feet above ground level, the pilot sensed the engine turbine start to spool down towards idle.  He saw a red 'GOV' light illuminated on the instrument panel.  The pilot did not disengage the flight notch on the collective twist grip to manually control the fuel flow to the engine and proceeded to fly the helicopter about 1/8 mile towards the parking lot, working the collective to try to keep the helicopter above the trees and the roofs of the houses.  He used all the available rotor rpm in an attempt to arrest the landing.  The helicopter landed hard, collapsing the landing skids, and the ship slid about 100 feet.  After the helicopter came to rest, the main rotor was still rotating at a slower rpm, and the engine was operating at what seemed like a low idle speed.  The partial loss of engine power was initiated by an inconsistency of greater than 3 percent between the two N2 (free turbine speed) sensors on the engine.  This inconsistency resulted in the fuel control entering a fixed mode that freezes the fuel flow at the level it was at when the inconsistency was detected, and the illumination of a red 'GOV' light in the cockpit.  The power required for forward flight is less than the power required to hover.  The fixed fuel flow to the engine provided insufficient power to fly and land the helicopter at speeds below 35 knots, which resulted in low rotor rpm and a high rate of decent prior to the hard landing.  In the event of a red 'GOV' light the pilot is to disengage the flight notch and control the fuel manually with the collective twist grip, which would allow the pilot to regain the full power range of the engine.  At an altitude of 150 to 200 feet and airspeed of 35 knots, the pilot was operating in the avoidance zone of the documented height-velocity diagram, and therefore, may not have had enough time to fully respond to the partial loss of power by selecting an emergency landing site, disengaging the twist grip flight notch, and exercising manual control of the engine.",
            "probable_cause": "An inconsistency between the engines' two N2 sensor signals caused the fuel control to enter a fixed mode, which limited the power available.

The hose which broke loose was the inboard of two hoses which had been attached by the refueler to the left wing refueling panel.  Examination of the hose revealed that it came loose due to the fracture of the three refueling adapter ring locking lugs on the airplane's inboard left wing refueling port.  Metallurgical examination of the inboard (fractured) adapter and the outboard adapter indicated that although the inboard adapter had a different microstructure and probably a different heat treatment history from the outboard adapter, they both met the applicable requirements for ultimate tensile strength and chemistry.  Additionally, the metallurgical examination found the locking lug fractures to be the result of a one-time ductile overstress with no indications of preexisting cracking, corrosion, or defects that would have degraded the load-carrying capacity of the adapter.  Therefore, the failure of the adapter was the result of an overload applied at the time of the separation.  The investigation revealed that the refueler had improperly positioned the hydrant truck in relation to the airplane's left wing refueling panel prior to commencing refueling operations.  Because of this positioning, the lift platform's left railing obstructed the normal nozzle attachment procedure to the airplane's inboard manifold adapter.  Subsequently, while attaching the nozzle, the refueler improperly routed the hose over the top of the front railing, around the left forward corner support of the railing structure, and aft to the airplane's inboard manifold adapter ring.  The investigation also revealed evidence consistent with the refueler lowering the lift platform, for personal comfort during the long refueling, and the refueling hose then catching on the platform's left front railing and bumper.  Vertical pull tests indicated that the three nozzle attachment lugs were capable of supporting a load in excess of 10,000 pounds if the load was applied along the nozzle centerline.  However, the weight bearing capability of the lugs dropped off as the load was applied at increasing angles off the centerline.  At an angle of 30 degrees off centerline, the lugs failed below 1,000 pounds of load.  The refueler's improper routing of the fuel hose would have placed an off-axis load of approximately 52 degrees. The angular force applied to the manifold adapter ring was amplified when the refueling hose was pressurized.  The combination of the two forces resulted in the adapter ring's failure.  Pressurized fuel discharged forming a fuel mist cloud that subsequently ignited.  The resulting fire resulted in fatal injuries to the refueler.  The airplane's lower leading edge panels, the refueling control panel, and the outboard portions of the left engine fan cowl and thrust reverser were thermally damaged.  The hydrant truck was destroyed in the fire.  Since the accident, two companies have introduced modifications to help position hydrant dispenser trucks during single person operations, and industry groups are examining the need for changes to existing industry standards and practices of aircraft fueling.  ",
            "probable_cause": "the overstress fracture of the airplane's refueling adapter ring that resulted from the abnormal angular force applied to it.  The applied angular force occurred due to the ground refueler inadequately positioning the hydrant fuel truck (in relation to the airplane), and his inattentiveness while lowering the refueling lift platform, thus permitting the refueling hose to become snagged and pulled at an angle.  The fracture of the adapter ring during the refueling led to the ignition of the pressurized (mist producing) spilled fuel and subsequent fire.  "

The check pilot attempted to turn right towards the airport; however, the helicopter rolled to the left again.  The check pilot regained control, shut the engine down, and completed an autorotation to a field.  The tail rotor drive shaft coupling was supported by the aft hangar bearing, and inspection revealed that it had sheared in torsional overload due to an overheated and seized number 6 hangar bearing.  Post accident examination revealed that the hangar bearing inner race and the balls had large heat affected zones from overheating during operation (the metal in the races ball path had been molten and then had resolidified).  The grease was also black and dry, with imbedded metal particles.   A series of service bulletins, alert service bulletins, and airworthiness directives (including an emergency AD issued by the FAA) had been issued beginning in October 2001 through 2004 concerning the overheating and failure of the hangar bearings.  The bulletins and airworthiness directives dealt with, in part, the modification of the helicopter to include cooling ducts and changes to existing bearings to prevent overheating and eventual bearing failure.  The ADs mandated inspections of the hangar bearings every 25 hours of flight; bearing replacement before further flight was called out if metal particles or \"black\" grease was observed at any bearing.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.A Sikorsky S-76C++ departed on an air taxi flight from PHI, Inc.\u2019s heliport en route to an offshore oil platform with two pilots and seven passengers. Data from the helicopter\u2019s flight data recorder indicated that the helicopter established level cruise flight at 850 feet mean sea level and 135 knots indicated air speed. About 7 minutes after departure, the cockpit voice recorder recorded a loud bang, followed by sounds consistent with rushing wind and a power reduction on both engines and a decay of main rotor revolutions per minute. Due to the sudden power loss, the helicopter departed controlled flight and descended rapidly into marshy terrain.Examination of the wreckage revealed that both the left and right sections of the cast acrylic windshield were shattered. Feathers and other bird remains were collected from the canopy and windshield at the initial point of impact and from other locations on the exterior of the helicopter. Laboratory analysis identified the remains as coming from a female red-tailed hawk; the females of that species have an average weight of 2.4 pounds. No defects in the materials, manufacturing, or construction were observed. There was no indication of any preexisting damage that caused the windshield to shatter. Thus, the fractures at the top of the right section of the windshield and damage to the canopy in that area were consistent with a bird impacting the canopy just above the top edge of the windshield. The fractures in the other areas of the windshields were caused by ground impact.The S-76C++ helicopter has an overhead engine control quadrant that houses, among other components, two engine fire extinguisher T-handles and two engine power control levers (ECL). The fire extinguisher T-handles, which are located about 4 inches aft of the captain\u2019s and first officer\u2019s windshields, are normally in the full-forward position during flight, and each is held in place by a spring-loaded pin that rests in a detent; aft pulling force is required to move the T-handles out of their detents. If the T handles are moved aft, a mechanical cam on each T-handle pushes the trigger on the associated ECL out of its wedge-shaped stop, allowing the ECL to move aft, reducing fuel to the engine that the ECL controls. (Flight crews are trained to move an engine\u2019s fire extinguisher T-handle full aft in the event of an in-flight fire so that the ECL can move aft and shut off the fuel flow to the affected engine.) The impact of the bird on the canopy just above the windshield near the engine control quadrant likely jarred the fire extinguisher T-handles out of their detents and moved them aft, pushing both ECL triggers out of their stops and allowing them to move aft and into or near the flight-idle position, reducing fuel to both engines. A similar incident occurred on November 13, 1999, in West Palm Beach, Florida, when a bird struck the windshield of an S-76C+ helicopter, N276TH, operated by Palm Beach County. The bird did not penetrate the laminated glass windshield, but the impact force of the bird cracked the windshield and dislodged the fire extinguisher T-handles out of their detents; however, in that case, the force was not great enough to move the ECLs. Maintenance records indicated that PHI replaced the original laminated glass windshields delivered on the accident helicopter with after-market cast acrylic windshields about 2 years before the accident. The after-market windshields provided a weight savings over the original windshields. PHI again replaced the windshields (due to cracking) with cast acrylic windshields about 1 year before the accident. Aeronautical Accessories Incorporated (AAI) designed and produced the after-market windshields and obtained supplemental type certificate (STC) approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in April 1997. AAI did not perform any bird-impact testing on the cast acrylic windshields supplied for the S-76C++, and the FAA\u2019s approval of the STC did not require such testing.  PHI also replaced the original windshields on other helicopters with the cast acrylic windshields; one of these helicopters experienced a bird-strike incident about 2 years before the accident. Postincident examination revealed a near-circular hole with radiating cracks near the top center of the right windshield. The bird penetrated the windshield and pushed the right-side T-handle. The trapped remains of the bird prevented the right-side throttle from being reengaged, but the pilot was able to land the helicopter safely. In 1978, when the S-76 was certificated, there were no bird-strike requirements. Currently, 14 Code of Federal Regulations 29.631 (in effect since August 8, 1996) states that, at a minimum, a transport-category helicopter, such as the S-76C++, should be capable of safe landing after impact with a 2.2-pound bird at a specified velocity. This requirement includes windshields. Current FAA requirements for transport-category helicopter windshields also state that \u201cwindshields and windows must be made of material that will not break into dangerous fragments.\u201d About 4 months after this accident, Sikorsky issued a safety advisory to all operators of the S-76C++ regarding the reduced safety of acrylic windshields (both cast and stretched) compared to the helicopter\u2019s original windshield. According to the advisory, the S-76C++\u2019s laminated glass windshield demonstrated more tolerance to penetrating damage from in-flight impacts (such as bird strikes) compared to acrylic windshields. Sikorsky expressed concern in the safety advisory that the presence of a hole through the windshield, whether created directly by object penetration or indirectly through crack intersections, may cause additional damage to the helicopter, cause disorientation or injury to the flight crew, increase pilot workload, or create additional crew-coordination challenges. The investigation revealed that, following this accident, PHI is replacing all of the windshields in its S 76 helicopters with windshields that meet European bird-strike standards. Based on main rotor speed decay information provided by Sikorsky, the accident flight crew had, at most, about 6 seconds to react to the decaying rotor speed condition. Had they quickly recognized the cause of the power reduction and reacted very rapidly, they would likely have had enough time to restore power to the engines by moving the ECLs back into position. However, the flight crewmembers were likely disoriented from the bird strike and the rush of air through the fractured windshield; thus, they did not have time to identify the cause of the power reduction and take action to move the ECLs back into position. The accident helicopter was not equipped with an audible alarm or a master warning light to alert the flight crew of a low-rotor-speed condition. An enhanced warning could have helped the accident flight crew quickly identify the decaying rotor speed condition and provided the flight crew with more opportunity to initiate the necessary corrective emergency actions before impact.",
            "probable_cause": "(1) the sudden loss of power to both engines that resulted from impact with a bird (red-tailed hawk), which fractured the windshield and interfered with engine fuel controls, and (2) the subsequent disorientation of the flight crewmembers, which left them unable to recover from the loss of power. Contributing to the accident were (1) the lack of Federal Aviation Administration regulations and guidance, at the time the helicopter was certificated, requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes; (2) the lack of protections that would prevent the T handles from inadvertently dislodging out of their detents; and (3) the lack of a master warning light and audible system to alert the flight crew of a low-rotor-speed condition."

The pilot and crew chief said that about 5-10 seconds after takeoff a significant compressor stall happened with a loud explosion, followed by engine spool down.  The airplane is a two-seat ex-military jet fighter produced in the 1950's and early 1960's by Hawker for service in the British Royal Air Force.  Following the airplane's surplus from the RAF, it was imported into the United States and was being flown under a FAA special airworthiness certificate in the experimental category for the purpose of exhibition and racing.  According to records at Rolls-Royce, the engine was manufactured in 1954 and sent to the RAF as part of a spares contract.  The engine was last in the factory overhaul facility on March 26, 1981, for overhaul at 251 hours TSO. The engine is life limited to 450 hours between overhauls. The last manufacturer's records on this engine documented its installation in another Hawker Hunter by the RAF in 1983, with 392 hours TSO.  The operator's engine maintenance records began on June 27, 1990, and documented its installation in the accident airframe at a maintenance facility in Wisconsin.  An unsigned handwritten note preceded this entry and stated that the engine had a total run time since overhaul of 436 hours, with 265 hours remaining to overhaul.  No documentation was available to support the engine history between leaving RAF service and the installation in the accident airframe.  The last entry in the records was dated July 2, 1999, and consisted of an annual inspection at a time of 548 hours since last overhaul.  A partial engine disassembly revealed that three third stage compressor blades had fractured from their root fixing lugs and separated.  All compressor blades from stages 5 through 10 had fractured through their airfoil sections just outboard of the root.  The root lugs from the failed third stage were removed and submitted for metallurgical analysis.  All three blades failed due to high cycle fatigue failures, which initiated in the bores of the lug fixing pins.  Energy Dispersive X-ray revealed corrosion cracks and pits at the crack initiation site.  This engine has a history of high cycle fatigue failures of stage 3 compressor blades due to corrosion pits. Two modifications were introduced by the manufacturer, which incorporated a strengthened lug and a silicon rubber sealant to the bore interface to prevent the corrosion induced fatigue failures.  The modifications were performed by the RAF between 1983 and 1986 to in-service and spares stock engines.  This engine did not have these modifications incorporated. ",

The airplane was owned and operated by Eastern Flying Service, Inc. under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137.According to the pilot, the landing area was oriented in a west-northwest direction and landing in the east-southeast direction was not an option due to powerlines on the approach end, and trees and a river on the east side. He further stated that due to the short length of the landing surface, a balked landing was not an option. As the airplane approached the landing area from the east, after clearing the bordering 100-foot-tall trees, the pilot lowered the nose, and made a three-point landing. The airplane touched down in the turf portion of the landing area, just prior to the paved surface, as he had done for at least eight previous landings. He applied the brakes and reported that the pedal \"pressure felt normal;\" however, there was no braking action noted. While applying back pressure to the control stick, he released and reapplied the brakes and the airplane nosed over, coming to rest inverted.According to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the airplane came to rest inverted at the edge of a paved landing area.

Subsequent examination of the engine revealed that the oil filter adapter was loose and that it was installed incorrectly with two copper crush gaskets rather than with one copper crush gasket and one fiber gasket per the manufacturer\u2019s installation instructions. The fiber gasket would have held the required torque for the fitting; however, the copper crush gasket did not hold the required torque. Because the oil filter adapter was loose, oil leaked from the engine, which led to the failure of the Nos. 4 and 5 connecting rods due to a lack of oil lubrication. The oil filter adapter was not original equipment on the engine. Although it could be installed under a supplemental type certificate, a review of maintenance and aircraft records did not reveal any entry or record pertaining to the installation of the oil filter adapter. The airplane had been operated for about 70 hours since its most recent annual inspection, which was performed about 1 year before the accident. It could not be determined when the oil filter adapter was incorrectly installed.

The engine start and pretakeoff checks were normal, and, after departure, the flight appeared to progress normally. About 1 to 2 minutes after completing an in-flight power check, the pilot heard a \"distinct loud pop.\" Subsequently, the engine lost total power, and the pilot entered an autorotation. The helicopter landed hard, its right skid collapsed, and it rolled on its right side. A postaccident examination of the helicopter's engine air inlet found that cloth material had been ingested into the engine air intake. During further examinations, more cloth material was found in the engine in a sufficient quantity and location to block the airflow through the engine and cause it to flame out. The cloth material found in the engine was consistent with maintenance rags found in a box at the operator's hangar facility. It is likely that, during the maintenance of the helicopter's engine, maintenance personnel covered vulnerable areas of the engine with shop rags to prevent contamination, and, during the reinstallation of the engine, they did not remove all of the shop rags. The engine then ingested the rags during the postmaintenance test flight.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot had purchased the Beechcraft airplane about 18 months before the accident and based it at his home airport, which was located at an elevation of about 80 ft mean sea level (msl). The pilot flew the Beechcraft to an airport that was at an elevation of about 7,100 ft msl. A few days after his arrival, he returned to the airport for his planned departure and spent about 15 minutes asking the fixed base operator owner, who was also a pilot, multiple questions about the route to his next planned destination. According to the owner, he was surprised by the nature of the pilot\u2019s questions, his lack of basic aeronautical information knowledge for area restrictions, and his lack of formal planning for his flight. No witnesses reported anything unusual about the engine start or taxi. At the time the pilot was cleared by the air traffic control tower controller for takeoff, the airport density altitude was about 9,000 ft. No ground witnesses reported observing anything unusual with the takeoff, but a Cessna 172 pilot who was behind the Beechcraft reported that the Beechcraft\u2019s climbout was slow. Shortly after his own takeoff, about 75 seconds after the Beechcraft, the Cessna pilot asked the tower controller about the Beechcraft\u2019s situation and intentions because the Cessna was already well above the Beechcraft. This prompted the controller to ask the Beechcraft pilot if he needed assistance, and the pilot responded that he was climbing \u201cvery slowly\u201d and would remain near the airport. Shortly after that, the Cessna pilot saw the Beechcraft impact trees. The accident site was about 3 miles southeast of the airport at an elevation about 300 ft below that of the departure airport. A postimpact fire obscured or destroyed a significant amount of evidence.Review of the Beechcraft\u2019s published performance data revealed that, for the given conditions, the airplane should have been able to successfully depart the airport and climb at a rate of about 500 feet per minute. Most of the engine components and all of the propeller components that survived the accident, displayed no evidence of preimpact mechanical deficiencies. The engine cylinder conditions were indicative of a history of generally lean operation. In addition, the No. 5 cylinder exhaust valve\u2019s appearance was consistent with excessively lean operation for an undetermined period of time, and the fuel injector nozzle for that cylinder was found to be partially occluded. Excessively lean operation will reduce engine power output, and will manifest itself as abnormally high exhaust and cylinder head temperatures and possible engine roughness. Further, if the No. 5 cylinder\u2019s injector was occluded for the flight, it would have resulted in overly lean operation of and reduced power output from that cylinder, yielded higher exhaust and cylinder head temperatures, and likely manifested itself as engine roughness. (Some witnesses close to the impact site reported that the engine was making \u201cpopping\u201d noises.) Although the airplane was equipped to monitor, display, and record temperatures for each cylinder, it could not be determined whether the pilot monitored that display, and fire damage prevented the recovery of that data from the engine monitor. Further, there was insufficient evidence to determine the source of the injector\u2019s occlusion, quantify its effects on engine power output, determine its relation to the condition of the exhaust valve, or determine if it was present for the takeoff or an artifact of the postimpact fire. Although the engine was developing power at impact, there was insufficient evidence to quantify the actual power output for the climb or at the time of impact. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether the pilot ensured that the throttle and propeller controls were set to and remained in their appropriate positions for the departure or whether the pilot adjusted the mixture properly (not overly lean). It is likely that the pilot lifted off prematurely at a speed lower than the prescribed value and was unable to accelerate or climb the airplane once it exited the ground effect regime. Because the surrounding terrain and the impact point were lower than the elevation of the airport, the pilot was able to continue to fly the airplane before crashing. This scenario is at least partially corroborated by the pilot\u2019s reported lack of preparation for the flight, which could have included a lack of performance planning. This scenario is also partially corroborated by the observed repetitive minor banking of the airplane, which often occurs when an airplane is flying very slowly.A premature liftoff or a climb attempt at a speed significantly below the prescribed value would place the airplane in a situation where the power required for level flight was very near to or exceeded the available power. A recovery would require the pilot to lower the nose in order to accelerate the airplane to obtain a positive rate of climb. Such an action is counterintuitive when low to the ground and requires accurate problem recognition, knowledge of the correct solution, and sufficient terrain clearance to accomplish. During the departure, the pilot reduced his options by deciding to turn to the east instead of continuing straight ahead to the south. Review of topographic data revealed that a four-lane highway was located just beyond the south end of the runway, and was situated in a north-south valley that descended to the south. However, instead of tracking over that highway, which could have been used as an off-airport emergency landing site, and its descending valley, which provided increasing terrain clearance, the pilot opted to turn east, toward higher, wooded terrain. Although that turn was consistent with both a left traffic pattern (in order to remain close to the airport as the pilot reported to the air traffic controller), and toward the pilot\u2019s on-course heading, by making that turn, the pilot reduced the likelihood of a partially or fully successful outcome to the flight.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inability to maintain a climb after departure in high-density altitude conditions, which resulted in a collision with trees and terrain. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's decision not to track the four-lane highway just beyond the departure runway, which he could have used as an alternate landing site; his premature rotation of the airplane; and degraded engine performance that affected the airplane's climb ability."

The airplane was equipped with a GPS navigation system incorporating a moving map feature.  During the initial portions of the flight after departure, the TRACON sector controller working the flight initially believed the airplane was destined to another airport and issued a clearance accordingly, but corrected the clearance after the pilot questioned the controller.  Shortly after this discussion, the pilot significantly deviated from his cleared course for unknown reasons in the general direction of the mistaken airport.  The controller noticed the deviation and corrected the pilot's course.  A second controller in the next sector the airplane would be worked by overheard the course correction, and inferred the pilot was somewhat confused.  After handoff by the first controller, the second sector controller attempted to provide what he believed was a helpful method of handling the airplane in the transition to the GPS approach; however, these methods of clearing the pilot for the GPS approach were not in strict accordance with FAA Order 7110.65, and included an intercept angle with the final approach course that was greater than allowed.  The airplane was on a modified downwind and proceeding to the initial approach fix (IAF) when the controller cleared the pilot to turn toward an intermediate fix between the IAF and the final approach fix (FAF) with the idea in mind that this course would be the same as a radar vector to the FAF.  The pilot questioned the clearance, and then acknowledged it, and the airplane turned left toward the FAF, which was directly behind the airplane.  The controller noticed that the left turn put the airplane heading toward high terrain and advised the pilot to turn right to go to the intermediate fix.  After some additional confusion the airplane's track stabilized on the approach course after passing the intermediate fix.  As the airplane passed the FAF the controller told the pilot to contact the tower, but gave him the frequency for the wrong airport.  The pilot questioned the controller, who insisted the frequency was correct.  The pilot then contacted the second airport tower and was told he was on the wrong frequency.  Almost 1 minute elapsed between the pilot's acknowledgement of the erroneous frequency, and his initial contact to the correct tower.  During this period the airplane's heading diverged approximately 90 degrees from the published final approach course toward rising terrain and the accident site.  The Minimum Safe Altitude Warning alarms went off in the TRACON and in the tower, and the tower controller provided a low altitude safety alert based on the alarm by saying \"check your altitude immediately;\" however, at the time of the low altitude alert, the airplane was about 500 feet above the Minimum Descent Altitude (the accident site elevation was about 200 feet above the MDA.) and the alert was activated not because the airplane's altitude was below the segment minimums but due to the course and altitude being projected to come in contact with terrain in the near future.  This may have confused the pilot and decreased the perceived urgency.  The limitations of the radar display effectively masked the initial portions of the course deviation and the controller did not see the deviation for some 30 seconds; however, the controller did advise the pilot that he was off course as soon as he was aware of it.  The pilot's unintelligible response was about the time the radar target return went into coast mode.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain the course for the published approach procedure due to his diverted attention.  The distraction responsible for the pilot's diverted attention was the erroneous frequency assignment provided by ATC and the resultant task overload induced by this problem and the confusion surrounding the ATC clearances to get established on the final approach course, which likely involved repeated reprogramming of the navigation system.  Factors in the accident include the failure of ATC to provide the pilot with a timely and effective safety alert concerning the deviation from the proper course, which was influenced in part by the features of the radar display at both facilities which made the deviation more difficult to detect, and the nature of radar as a secondary tool for a VFR tower controller.  An additional factor was the nonstandard method of providing approach clearance, which likely may have exacerbated pilot task overload."

Before the accident flight the next morning, he performed a preflight inspection of the airplane; there was no water in the fuel sample, which appeared to be blue, similar to 100LL aviation fuel. The pilot performed an engine run-up before takeoff, and no anomalies were noted. During climbout, the airplane vibrated slightly, and the climb performance degraded. The airplane reached 2,100 ft above ground level, and the left engine then sputtered and lost all power. Shortly after, the right engine also lost all power, and the pilot conducted a forced landing to a highway median. The smell of Jet A fuel was prominent at the accident scene. A postaccident examination of the reciprocating engines revealed that they exhibited signs of detonation, consistent with having been operated with Jet A fuel, and a review of fueling records revealed that the airplane had been serviced with Jet A fuel instead of the required 100LL aviation fuel. Further, the FBO employee who fueled the airplane reported that he mistakenly serviced the airplane with 53 gallons of Jet A fuel; examination of the fuel tank filler ports revealed placards next to the ports indicating that\u00a0only 100LL fuel was to be used.\u00a0A credit card receipt signed by the pilot also showed that the airplane was serviced with Jet A fuel. The FBO employee also noted that the nozzle on the Jet A fuel truck was small and round like the nozzle on the aviation gas fuel truck. According to the airport manager, the larger Jet A nozzle, which was J-shaped with an opening of 2 3/4 inches, had recently been switched to a smaller, round nozzle; switching to a smaller fuel nozzle increased the chances that aircraft that needed 100LL fuel could be misfueled with Jet A fuel.The Federal Aviation Administration had issued an airworthiness directive (AD) about 26 years before the accident requiring that the filler ports be equipped with restrictors to preclude misfueling; the restrictors reduced the fuel filler diameter to 1 5/8 inches. A review of the airplane\u2019s maintenance records indicated that the AD had been accomplished; however, an examination of the airplane revealed that it was not equipped with the required restrictors. Based on the evidence, the engine likely lost power due to the use of the improper fuel type. Further, the noncompliance with the AD increased the possibility that the airplane could be misfueled with Jet A fuel, as occurred before the accident.",

The private pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The local personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the flight that departed Ferguson Airport (82J), Pensacola, Florida, about 1010. The pilot owned the airplane and based it at 82J. Prior to the accident flight, he had completed a 15-minute personal scenic flight uneventfully with a different passenger. That passenger then deplaned and the pilot boarded another passenger for another 15-minute local flight. When the airplane did not return, search and rescue procedures were initiated. An Alabama State Police helicopter tracked the pilot's mobile phone and located the wreckage about 1600, in swampy terrain approximately 5 miles northwest of 82J. The airplane was not, nor was it required to be, equipped with a transponder. Review of preliminary radar data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed primary radar targets recorded near 82J about the time of the accident. The targets were consistent with a departure on runway 18, followed by a left downwind leg departure from the airport traffic pattern and a left turn to west. After a westerly track about 4 miles, there was an approximate 1-mile gap in data, followed by five targets recorded on a northerly track near the accident site. The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on October 9, 2012. At that time, he reported a total flight experience of 700 hours. The two-seat tandem, bi-wing, tailwheel airplane, serial number 7115-J521, was assembled in 1978 and issued an FAA experimental airworthiness certificate. It was powered by a Lycoming O-320, 150-horsepower engine.Due to the terrain, the investigative team could not safely access the wreckage.

According to the pilot, about 50 minutes into the flight, he initiated an approach for landing at one of the planned locations,and, during the descent, he obtained an automated weather observation from an airport located about 6 miles to the northwest. During the approach, the pilot determined that the wind speed and direction would not permit a landing at his first intended site.

The front seat pilot was fatally injured and the pilot rated rear seat occupant was seriously injured.  A witness stated, \"On several of these approaches, I noticed that the nose would rise to above level flight slightly during or after the turn, and it appeared that the application of right rudder was used to force the nose to align with the runway causing a skid during a portion of the turn.  ...  I commented to my wife that the technique used would likely be disastrous some day for whoever was flying the plane.  ...  It was apparent that the same techniques were being used on this approach, and suddenly the right wing started down, rotation began and the aircraft contacted the ground nearly straight down, maybe a block from the end of the runway facing west/northwest.  The close in base leg with relatively flat turn (bank angle) and skid from right rudder application were visible before the roll started.  The engine was audible, sounding as though normal full throttle had been applied, in an attempt to recover from the obvious spin that had begun.  The aircraft spun to the right and hit the ground.\"  Another witness stated, \" I do not believe he was belted in - when I looked into the cockpit to check on pilot (female front seat) the rear seat belt on left side appeared to be somewhat neatly tucked in next to the seat.  The right side belt was hanging out of the aircraft, which was the side he came out of.\"  The pilot rated rear seat occupant stated that the aircraft did not have a nose up attitude before it nosed over.  He stated that he and the front seat pilot were alternating flying the takeoffs and landings.  He said the front pilot was flying the accident approach to land.  The pilot did not describe a typical pattern when asked.  He stated there was no binding in the aircraft controls and the engine was performing normally.  The airplane's operator endorsed both pilots' applications for their instructor ratings.  Leading edge nicks and chordwise abrasion were found on both propeller blades.  Flight control continuity was established to all control surfaces.  The engine exhibited a thumb compression at all cylinders.  The magnetos produced a spark when rotated by hand.  Control continuity to the engine was established.  An aluminum colored seat belt end from the rear seat was found detached from the fastener that secured it.

About 20 seconds later, there was a sudden and total electrical failure and the engine lost power. The pilot switched from the MAIN battery to the AUX battery in an attempt to restore electrical and engine power, but left it selected for only about 2 to 3 seconds.  He then switched back to the MAIN battery and concentrated on the emergency forced landing.  He could not recall if the propeller was windmilling at the time (a windmilling propeller would be necessary to start the engine using AUX battery power). The pilot made a forced landing on an access road and collided with a wall causing substantial damage.  The airplane was equipped with a dual electronic ignition system, not magnetos.  A constant source of electrical power was required for ignition.  In the event of an electrical power loss, the engine would lose power.  An FAA avionics inspector said the 5-amp main fuse had opened, probably due to a shorted wire inside the master relay, resulting in an over-current condition.  This caused the master relay to de-energize and cut power to the bus.  The alternator, which was tested to 10.5 volt output, has a nominal output of 13.8 volts.  Minimal output to charge the battery is 12.5 volts.  The FAA inspector's statement noted that the cockpit-mounted master switch activated the positive side of the master relay solenoid.  Standard industry practice was to wire the positive side of the master relay to the unfused input from the battery, and then switch the negative side using the master switch.  Some commercially available solenoids have the positive terminal wired to the battery input.",

The final approach path was over the lake.  About 50 seconds before the accident occurred, the airplane was aligned for landing on runway 13 and was approximately 1.5 miles from the threshold, about 750 feet agl, at an indicated airspeed of 210 knots, and a descent rate of 1,900 feet per minute (fpm).

The airplane continued to turn right until it impacted the water on a heading of about 332 degrees, at an indicated airspeed of 123 knots, and a descent rate of 1,300 fpm.  Examination of the wreckage confirmed that the airplane impacted the water in a right wing low attitude.  No evidence of any mechanical discrepancies was found.  Scattered very heavy and intense thunderstorms were located north through east of the accident location.  No convective showers or thunderstorms were in the vicinity of the airplane when it crashed.  Several cloud layers were present over the destination airport around the accident time.

At the time the airplane turned right off the final approach course, it was at approximately the altitude of the lowest cloud layer.  The pilot had completed a familiarization course in the airplane the day before the accident.  The course consisted of about 30 hours of ground instruction and 18 hours of flight instruction.  The course flight time was the pilot's total flight experience in this make and model of airplane.  The instructor who provided the training reported that during the course he twice discussed with the pilot a list of pilot limitations to be adhered to following course completion.

During the approach, the pilot was advised by the tower controller that his landing lights could be seen over the approach end of the runway as the airplane was 'going back into the clouds.' The airplane was next observed well left of the runway.  The pilot was asked his altitude and he responded '300 feet.'  The tower controller gave the pilot a vector and told him to contact approach control, and the airplane disappeared into the clouds again.  The airplane then exited the base of the clouds in a right descending turn and struck the ground.  Weather conditions immediately before and after the accident at Bridgeport were reported in part as 400 foot overcast, rain and visibility of 2 to 3 miles.  Radar data revealed erratic altitudes on the glideslope and during vectors.  The accident airport did not have an approach lighting system to the precision approach runway.  In January 1995, the Safety Board issued a recommendation to install an approach lighting system to that runway 'as soon as possible.' ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during night instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing factors were dark night conditions, low ceilings, rain, and his decision to divert to an airport under instrument meteorological conditions when visual meteorological conditions existed at other airports.
