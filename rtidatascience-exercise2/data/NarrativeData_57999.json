The pilots of other helicopters heard the pilot make a mayday call with the clear \"engine out\" audio warning in the background.  A post crash fire consumed the majority of the wreckage.  An airframe examination revealed no evidence of a preimpact malfunction in what remained of the airframe.  An engine inspection and a metallurgical examination revealed that the compressor-coupling adapter, a Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) part made by a company other than Rolls-Royce, had failed above the shear point due to fatigue cracking initiated by fretting on the pilot diameter, which had disconnected the compressor from the turbine section.  The metallurgist noted that the damage was consistent with the rotation of the aft piece of the fractured compressor-coupling adapter within the stub shaft after it had separated.  Fretting damage to the impeller corresponded to the fretting damage on the compressor-coupling adapter, and indicated relative movement between the parts.  Rolls-Royce had records of 12 other compressor-coupling adapters that had fractured and failed, with all instances of the failure/fracture occurring in this specific new coupling design, which was significantly different than the previous design.  The nature of the fretting and fractures indicated that the newly designed couplings have a small amount of longitudinal movement that is occurring between the outer diameter of the compressor-coupling adapter and the inner diameter of the impeller, which was not a factor in the previous design.  If the spur adapter gear, compressor-coupling adapter, and compressor impeller (all coaxial spline joints) were in alignment, there would be no significant longitudinal movement of the pilot diameter.  However, any axial misalignment of these components during engine buildup, for example, could induce a misalignment that would result in relative motion between the components with each engine rotation.  The misalignment would also induce bending stresses into the compressor-coupling adapter in addition to torsion stresses that could result in fatigue.  The combination of fretting damage and cyclic bending stresses are most likely the main factor in the failures of these couplings.   One month prior to the accident, company maintenance personnel had changed out the engine gearbox due to finding a loose stud on the gearbox to turbine section mounting.  Changing the gearbox would involve disturbing the coaxial spline joints between the spur adapter gear, compressor-coupling adapter, and compressor impeller.",
            "probable_cause": "a loss of engine power due to the fatigue fracture and separation of the compressor coupling adapter.  The fatigue fracture was initiated by fretting on the pilot diameter due to both the inadequate design of the coupling and the coaxial misalignment of the spur adapter gear, compressor-coupling adapter, and compressor impeller during recent engine maintenance where the gearbox was removed and replaced.  A factor in the accident was the unsuitable nature of the terrain to make an emergency landing."

The tentative plan scripted for the production shoot called for an actor to drop a backpack to the ground while the helicopter was in a hover to enable the cameras to film the airborne actor, the backpack receiver on the ground, and the helicopter executing the mission. Two shots were needed of the backpack being dropped, and they were to be done by two different actors at two separate locations at a movie ranch; the accident occurred during the filming of the second shot.\u000b\u000bRecovered audio and video recordings from inside the helicopter revealed that the first bag-drop flight occurred around 2100, lasted about an hour, and consisted of four actual bag drops. During the first flight, the pilot made numerous comments about not being able to see the drop zone due to the dark night conditions and had the actor guide him with verbalized visual cues to ensure that the helicopter remained clear of trees. Several of the pilot\u2019s comments indicate that he was trying to be amenable to the production company\u2019s requests, and, although he did not directly communicate that he could not comply with some of them, he repeatedly remarked on the limited visibility and the brightness of a flexible light pad affixed to the center windshield frame in the cockpit. After the flight, he expressed his appreciation to the ground crew for not pressuring him and giving him the opportunity to perform multiple passes.\u000b\u000bThe second bag-drop location was on a plateau close to the landing zone and was situated about 85 ft above a dry riverbed. The plan was for the helicopter to maneuver toward the plateau while ascending from the riverbed. There were no lights in the river valley; however, the production crew had placed lights on the plateau and glowsticks and another light on the sloping terrain leading up from the riverbed to the top of the plateau. The flight began around 0330 and was conducted with the pilot in the right-front seat, the actor in the left-front seat, and the camera operator in the left-rear seat. The flexible light pad was cupped to direct the light toward the actor\u2019s face.\u000b\u000bBefore takeoff, the camera operator asked the pilot if they could try to use the light pad, and the pilot responded, \u201cwe\u2019ll see, it just really [sigh] blinds me.\u201d The camera operator then showed the actor how to operate the light pad. The actor turned it on to the lowest setting, and the camera operator remarked that it was bright but that they would see what the pilot thought; the pilot did not comment. During the initial takeoff and while maneuvering over the dry riverbed, the actor continued with scripted dialogue for about a minute until the pilot intervened to state that he needed the light pad turned off. The camera operator acknowledged him and informed the actor to turn off the light by pressing a button twice. The actor leaned forward to turn off the light, and, 8 seconds later, the camera operator announced, \u201cwhere did uh, we\u2019re going down low,\u201d indicating that he was temporarily disoriented and then noted that they were descending. The actor cycled through the light\u2019s settings and eventually turned it off while the pilot simultaneously stated, \u201cokay, okay, I can\u2019t.\u201d The camera operator interrupted saying, \u201cpull up, pull up.\u201d The helicopter subsequently impacted terrain in the dry riverbed. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.\u000b\u000bThe pilot recognized on the first flight that he was operating with reduced/no visibility and with a bright light in the cockpit that \u201cblinded\u201d him when it was on but chose to proceed with both flights likely because he believed that was what was required to fulfill the production requirements. Despite recognizing the hazards of the operation and relaying his concerns to the ground crew and camera operator, the pilot was the only person knowledgeable about helicopters. As the pilot, he was responsible for the safe operation of the helicopter and should have initiated the measures necessary to ensure that the helicopter\u2019s internal lighting and the lighting on the ground would enable him to conduct the flight in a safe manner. \u000bThe accident occurred during the hours of darkness on a moonless night over minimally lighted terrain. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidance, these conditions can result in illusions that make it difficult for a pilot to visually determine altitude, depth perception, and orientation, and often create the illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is. Additionally temporary blindness, caused by an unusually bright light, may result in illusions or after images until the eyes recover from the brightness. Based on the dark night conditions, the minimal ground lighting, the bright light in the cockpit, and the absence of preimpact mechanical anomalies, the pilot was likely temporarily blinded by the light, lost visual reference to the ground, and then flew the helicopter into the ground.\u000b\u000bBefore the accident flight, the company submitted, and an FAA inspector subsequently accepted, a proposed Motion Picture Plan of Activities (POA). During his review of the accident flight\u2019s POA, the FAA inspector had an opportunity to examine the proposed flight and location and determine if the proposed flight activities would be safe, but he failed to identify that the flight would be conducted on a moonless night over terrain with limited ground features and lights and to assess whether the equipment that would be used for lighting and filming would enable the pilot to conduct the flight in a safe manner. It is likely that, if the inspector had been fully aware of the conditions of the intended operation, he might have identified that the proposed flight activities were potentially unsafe. Although the accident occurred outside the time that the POA was valid, that did not contribute to the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s decision to conduct a flight in dark night conditions with an illuminated cockpit light that degraded his visibility and his ability to identify and arrest the helicopter\u2019s descent while maneuvering, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain.\u00a0Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration inspector\u2019s failure to identify the video production\u2019s flight as being potentially dangerous during the review of the proposed flight activities. \u00a0\u00a0"

Because the pilot was unable to maintain the required minimum altitude on the next leg of the flight, he elected to divert into a nearby airport. After getting below the overcast clouds, he shot a visual approach on a very dark night while looking through a partially ice-covered windshield. During the attempted landing, the pilot allowed the aircraft to contact the runway at a descent rate high enough to cause permanent structural damage to the aircraft's fuselage, and to permanently force the left main landing gear oleo strut to its fully compressed limit. The force of the impact also caused the tire support rim on the nose wheel to fracture into several pieces that were later recovered from the runway. After the rim separated from the main nose wheel drum, the drum portion of the wheel rolled along inside the tire. As the landing roll continued, the aircraft departed the runway and plowed through an 18 inch-high snow bank created by snow that had be removed from the runway. As the aircraft passed through the snow bank, the nose gear strut down-lock failed, and the nose gear was forced backwards and up into the wheel well. The collapse of the nose gear strut allowed the belly skin just aft of the nose gear well to come in contact with the snow bank, which resulted in the belly skin being pushed inward around the fuselage bulkheads.",

The pilot, two medical crewmembers and one patient were fatally injured. The airplane was registered to Elite Medical Air Transport, LLC; El Paso, Texas, and was operated by Amigos Aviation, Inc.; Harlingen, Texas. Day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 air ambulance flight. At the time of the accident the airplane was departing LRU for a flight to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona.The airplane arrived LRU about 1834 to pickup a patient for a flight to PHX. The pilot was still seated in the cockpit when he gave the line service technician a verbal order for a total of forty gallons of fuel. The line service technician drove the fuel truck to the front of the airplane and refueled the airplane putting 20 gallons in each wing. The pilot then assisted the line service technician with replacing both fuel caps. They both walked into the office and the pilot signed the machine printed fuel ticket. After departing LRU to the west a medical crewmember onboard the airplane called their medical dispatcher on a satellite telephone and reported they were returning to LRU because of a problem with smoke coming from the right engine. A witness driving westbound on the interstate highway reported the airplane was westbound and about 200 feet above ground level (agl) when he saw smoke begin to appear from the right engine. The airplane then began descending and started a left turn to the east. Another witness, driving eastbound on the interstate highway, reported the airplane was trailing smoke when it passed over him about 100 feet agl. He saw the descending airplane continue its left turn to the east and then lost sight of it. Several witnesses reported seeing the impact or hearing the sound of impact and they then immediately saw smoke or flames.Evidence at the scene showed the airplane was generally eastbound and upright when it impacted terrain resulting in the separation of the left propeller and the separation of the right aileron. The airplane came to rest inverted about 100 feet from the initial impact point, and there was an immediate postimpact fire which consumed much of the airplane. Investigators who arrived at the scene on the day following the accident reported detecting the smell of jet fuel.A postaccident review of refueling records and interviews with line service technicians showed that the airplane had been misfuelled with 40 gallons of Jet A fuel instead of the required 100LL aviation gasoline. At 1855 the automated weather observing system at LRU, located about 3 miles northeast from the accident location, reported wind from 040 degrees at 5 knots, visibility of 10 miles, broken clouds at 6,500 feet, temperature 23 degrees Celsius (C), dew point 16 degrees C, with an altimeter setting of 30.16 inches of Mercury.",

The CFI stated that he observed no abnormal indications at any time prior to the initial loss of engine power during takeoff. During an engine test run subsequent to the accident, while operating at moderate power, the fuel flow gauge began fluctuating before the engine suddenly lost power. The engine was re-started and again lost power after about 2 minutes. The engine-driven fuel pump was removed and disassembled with no anomalies noted.

The pilots performed the emergency procedures for an electrical fire, which included shutting down the electrical systems. The smoke seemed to initially subside, but then gradually intensified before the engine lost power. The pilots were unable to restart the engine and decided to concentrate on making an off-airport landing. While landing in a plowed field, the nosewheel collapsed almost immediately. Postaccident examination revealed extensive fire damage to the rear of the engine and to the firewall. The nose gear hydraulic actuator flexible hose assembly also sustained extensive fire damage consistent with being near the source of the fire. Further inspection found that the nose gear hydraulic down line remained attached at both attachment fittings. The flexible hose assembly installed on the nose gear actuator uses an AN-style B-nut fitting. The internally threaded hose socket is screwed onto the end of the hose, and the B-nut is secured to the actuator fitting by an externally threaded nipple. Closer examination of the hydraulic line fitting where it attaches to the actuator revealed a crack running along the entire length of the socket. The hose remained inserted into the socket, but because of the crack, the socket fitting could be turned by hand on the hose. The nose gear actuator hydraulic line was then removed. The hose end was easily pulled out and separated from the socket. The manufacturer's identification band indicated that the hose assembly was manufactured in the third quarter of 1991. A review of the scheduled maintenance section of the PA-46-310P maintenance manual in the landing gear group section states in part, to \"Replace flexible hoses as required, but no later than 1,000 hours of operation or eight years and at engine overhaul\".

The airplane was in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), but were approaching clouds that were known to remnants of a tropical storm.  The pilots were unsure if they could remain in VMC and had decided to turn on the engine anti-ice.  In accordance with the airplane flight manual (AFM) procedures, the pilots reduced the power to 89.5 percent N1 and both engines flamed out.  The left and right engines restarted on their own as the airplane descended through FL 300 and 240, respectively.  Testing of the airplane and engines immediately after the incident revealed that they were operating correctly.  Testing of the fuel revealed that it conformed to the specifications for Jet A and the concentration of the fuel system icing inhibitor was within limits.  Weather satellite imagery showed that there were convective weather cells in the area where the airplane's engines flamed out.  Convective weather can lift significant amounts of water into the upper atmosphere that then form ice crystals.  Research indicates that the ice crystals can partially melt passing through the JT15D-5 engine fan that can then accrete to an internal compressor stator.  When any accreted ice was shed from the stator vanes, it would pass through the high pressure compressor and could be picked up by the pressure sense line to the fuel control.  Flight tests confirmed that sense line could go below freezing at low power settings at high altitude.  Tests also show that if the sense line was blocked and the power levers were retarded, the electronic engine control would reduce the fuel flow to reduce the power, but the sense pressure within the fuel control would be maintained.  But when the blockage was cleared, the sudden reduction in the sense pressure in the fuel control would result in a reduction of the fuel flow at a rate that was much faster than a normal rapid power reduction and could result in the engine flaming out.",
            "probable_cause": "High-altitude ice crystals that had accreted on the compressor vanes and were ingested into the engine high pressure compressor when the pilots retarded the power levers causing compressor surges and the flameouts of both engines.

The pilot contacted approach control and requested a practice ILS approach.  The controller instructed the pilot to proceed northwest bound and maintain 2,500 feet msl.  Radar indicated the airplane tracked a northerly heading instead of a northwesterly heading as instructed.  The airplane continued on a northerly heading until 1113:48 when it was about 5 miles southwest of the destination airport at 1,900 feet msl with a ground speed of 172 knots.  At this point, the controller instructed the pilot to turn southbound and remain clear of Class C airspace.  Radar coverage for the next 50 seconds was intermittent.  At 1114:29, radar picked up the airplane about 4 miles southwest of the destination airport at 1,800 feet msl, a ground speed of 106 knots, and a heading of 101 degrees.  The airplane continued heading east-southeast for about 30 seconds and its ground speed continued to decay.  At 1114:58, it entered an abrupt descent, going from 1700 feet to 200 feet in 15 seconds.  The last radar return was recorded at 1115:13 and showed the airplane at 200 feet msl, a ground speed of 64 knots, and a heading of 093 degrees.  Several witnesses observed the airplane descend in a \"flat spin\" and impact a shallow canal in a residential area.  Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted the canal in a nearly flat and level attitude.  No evidence of any pre-impact mechanical discrepancies with the airframe or engines was found that would have prevented normal operation.  Testing of the electronic engine controls revealed that both units were functional, but under some conditions would trip to manual mode.  Further investigation determined that the units tripping to manual mode was due to an electrical overstress that failed the same thermistor within each unit.  The reason for the electrical overstress or when it occurred could not be determined; however, it is probable it occurred at impact when the units were submerged in water.  Even if the units tripped to manual mode in flight, this would only result in the loss of the torque and temperature limiting and propeller synchrophaser systems, meaning the pilot would have to manually adjust the power levers as required to maintain the proper torque and exhaust gas temperature.  Post accident toxicology testing of the pilot's blood revealed chlorpheniramine, an over-the-counter sedating antihistamine, at more than ten times higher than the level expected with a typical maximum over-the-counter dose.

The first officer was the flying pilot for the takeoff on runway 10L.  The winds were from 180 degrees at 16, gusting to 22 knots.  The takeoff roll was normal, and the flying pilot utilized control wheel input to correct for the crosswind.  A few seconds after rotation, the crew noted the stick shaker annunciate, and flying pilot responded by gently easing back pressure off the control yoke.  The crew returned to land at the departure airport after controllers in the tower reported that the airplane may have struck the tail.  Flight Data Recorder (FDR) information indicated that the takeoff occurred during directionally variable wind conditions.  The wind shifted during the takeoff roll, resulting in a decreasing headwind, an increasing crosswind, and finally to an average 8-knot tailwind during rotation.  The maximum pitch rate during rotation was slightly higher than average, but within the normal expected variation.  Analysis of the data showed this was a minor contributor to the tail strike.  The flying pilot used significant wheel input (35 degrees right wheel) to counter the increasing crosswind, which resulted in the right spoiler raising 12 degrees and a corresponding loss of lift due to the use of spoilers.  Rotating at a lower airspeed requires a higher angle of attack, and therefore, a higher pitch attitude to achieve liftoff.  The combination of the tailwind gust and spoiler movement resulted in the airplane's pitch attitude exceeding 12.6 degrees while the gear was still on the ground.  This resulted in the aft body contact with the runway.  During a typical takeoff in gusty or strong crosswind conditions, the manufacturer recommended maximum takeoff thrust and to avoid rotation during a gust.  Slightly delaying rotation would allow the airplane additional time to accelerate through the gust, and the greater airspeed would improve the tail clearance margin.  The FDR-recorded longitudinal control system parameters suggested a properly functioning system.  The airplane motion was consistent with the control inputs and power settings.",

He noted no mention of any wind gusts in the airport\u2019s automatic terminal information service weather information before he took off. However, the pilot noticed light turbulence during the right crosswind and downwind legs in the traffic pattern. After a short approach and a smooth landing, he applied power, achieved rotation speed, and lifted off again.

Radar data showed the airplanes operating about 1 mile apart. The Cessna was operating to the west of the Piper at 2,500 ft mean sea level (msl) and 106 knots ground speed. The Piper was operating to the east of the Cessna at 2,600 ft msl and 92 knots. The Cessna was on a northerly heading and made a right turn to a southerly heading. The Piper was also on a northerly heading and made a left turn to a southwesterly heading. Both airplanes executed the turns simultaneously. Shortly after each airplane completed its turn, the track of both airplanes intersected. Calculations determined that the two airplanes collided at a 72-degree angle with a 116-knot closure rate. Propeller slashes on the Cessna\u2019s left wing indicated that the Piper was slightly above the Cessna at the moment of collision. During the collision sequence, the right side of the Piper\u2019s nose contacted the Cessna\u2019s rudder and continued forward into its left wing, which allowed the propeller to slash the trailing edge. The wreckages of both airplanes were found in the immediate vicinity of the radar-depicted track intersection. It is likely that the pilots had an opportunity to see each other during the turns.

Several witnesses reported gusty east-southeast winds, ranging between 25 and 40 knots, blowing directly across the runway.  They reported that as the airplane proceeded on its final approach to runway 19, which required a correction for a left crosswind, the airplane \"floated down the runway\" after passing over the runway threshold, and eventually touched down about mid-field.  As it touched down, the airplane bounced twice, which was immediately followed by the sound of full engine power.

According to the tow plane pilot, the handle had not been actuated and was in the forward position when the unscheduled releases occurred.  Postaccident examination and testing of the tow-hitch revealed no discrepancies or anomalies that would explain the unscheduled release.

The pilot stated that he moved the control wheel to the right, but the airplane did not respond.  He looked at the wing as he continued moving the control wheel and realized that the ailerons were not operating.   He landed the airplane on a dirt road using rudder and throttle to control movement.  During the landing, the right wing impacted a tree. The design of the control wheel to control column interface utilizes a nut plate installed inside the column.  A screw and collar are then inserted through the bottom of the control wheel and into the nut plate inside the column to secure it to the column.   Various Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Society Automotive Engineers (SAE) publications note that for proper clamping action at least three threads should show above the nut.  FAA publication AC 43.12 notes that screws and bolts should ideally be put in from the top down when at all possible to prevent the effects of gravity and vibration from loosening the fasteners.  During an on scene examination of the airplane, the FAA inspector found the attaching screw and collar from the left control wheel on the floor.  The inspector moved the left control wheel and found that the column would not move.  He moved the column and verified aileron continuity.  Post accident examination of the control wheel attachment screw, and several others from the same make and model airplane, revealed that there was a slight difference in length between them all.  It was also noted that some had different letter markings on the screw head.  On average, when the screws were fully torqued, between 1 and 1 1/2 threads were exposed beyond the top of the nut plate.

The pilot reported that he had 18 gallons of fuel in the right fuel tank and more than 25 gallons in the left fuel tank when the power loss occurred.  He indicated that he switched from the right to the left fuel tank position. The pilot called on the UNICOM frequency to report that he was low on fuel and needed assistance in finding an airport.  The pilot of another airplane gave him the vectors to the Greenwood airport.  The last radio transmission heard from the pilot was \"I'm over a four-lane highway\u2026no more fuel.\"  He later stated that instead of saying \"no more fuel,\" he should instead have reported that he had \"lost the engine.\"  During the forced landing, the airplane struck two power lines and two utility poles and came to rest on its right side with the left wing in the near-vertical position.  A power line penetrated the left wing, breaching the left fuel tank, but the left wing did not burn or explode.  The fuel selector was selected to the left fuel tank.  The right wing was separated from the fuselage, and the fuel tank was ruptured.  A fire ensued.  One witness stated that he saw fluid leaking from the left wing and onto the engine compartment.  He stated that he assumed the fluid was aviation fuel because whenever it hit the engine compartment, the fire flared up.  The second witness indicated that he smelled fuel and assumed fuel was sustaining the postcrash fire.  When the airplane was turned upright, the day after the accident, less than 1 gallon of fuel was drained from the left fuel tank.  The pilot reported that during his preflight inspection at the Peachtree-Dekalb Airport in Chamblee, he determined that the left and right wing fuel tanks each had more than 25 gallons of fuel.  He added 15 gallons of fuel per tank for a total of 80 gallons.  The airplane's total fuel capacity is 122 gallons, of which 120 gallons are usable.  Safety Board staff calculated that the airplane burned 20 gallons of fuel per hour at 75 percent power.  The total 2.2-hour flight was therefore calculated to have consumed about 44 gallons of fuel, not counting the fuel used to taxi, take off, and climb.

The airplane subsequently departed the runway and impacted a snow bank. The operator stated, \"The briefed REF [airspeed at the 50-foot point with flaps in the landing position and landing gear extended] speed was 101 knots.

The crew encountered light rime icing descending through 4,500 feet until the time they broke out visually at approximately 2,600 feet.  The crew utilized the aircraft boots 3 times on the approach to ensure the aircraft was free of contamination.  The crew descended on the PAPI [precision approach path indicator] for runway 36 after breaking out visually.  At approximately 55 feet the Captain brought the power levers to idle as normal.

Examination of the airplane revealed that the left wing fuel tank was devoid of fuel and that the right wing fuel tank contained about 6 gallons of fuel. Further examination revealed that, when the fuel line to the carburetor was removed and the fuel selector was selected to the \u201con\u201d position, fuel drained freely from the fuel tank. Examination of both fuel tank venting caps revealed no abnormalities that would have precluded normal operation.\u000b\u000bAccording to the fuel system drawing provided by the manufacturer, the fuel line from the right fuel tank runs laterally across the top of the airplane cabin to a T-fitting that is connected to the left tank fuel line. The fuel line then runs down the side of the airplane to the gascolator and the \u201con/off\u201d shutoff valve. The airplane had no interconnecting fuel venting system, and each fuel tank was independently vented through the fuel caps.An internet forum on this make and model kit airplane noted the occurrence of several other similar in-flight fuel starvation events. The general consensus of the forum discussion was that the fuel system design led to a partial or complete vacuum being developed during fuel consumption, which resulted in the fuel in the left fuel tank being consumed and a subsequent total power loss and in the right fuel tank being at or near maximum capacity. Therefore, it is likely that the fuel system\u2019s venting was not sufficient to provide adequate positive pressure and that this resulted in a vacuum developing between the right fuel tank and the T-fitting and the subsequent loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.",

Although concerned, the CFI continued the instructional flight, whereupon he determined that maneuvering the helicopter was taking considerably more power than he was accustomed to. About 30 minutes into the flight, the CFI landed the helicopter to once again check the right magneto because of the apparent lack of performance. The results showed the same excessive post-check rpm drop.

A service letter issued by the manufacturer about 47 years before the accident and a subsequent airworthiness directive issued by the Federal Aviation Administration required the installation of a placard on the instrument panel directly under the fuel quantity indicators which stated, \u201cAvoid landing approaches in red arc and over 30 second slips under 1/2 tank.\u201d The placard was not installed on the accident airplane at the time of the accident.Given the airplane\u2019s fuel state at the time of the accident and the absence of mechanical malfunctions in postaccident examinations, it is likely that, while the pilot was descending and maneuvering for landing using a prolonged sideslip, the fuel tank outlet became unported, and that the subsequent lack of fuel flow resulted in a loss of engine power.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot\u2019s prolonged sideslip maneuvers during the descent to landing. Contributing to the accident was the airplane\u2019s lack of a required placard advising pilots to avoid lengthy sideslip maneuvers with fuel tanks less than 1/2 full. "

A witness stated that the airplane was being \u201cbounced around\u201d by the wind gusts and that it \u201cstalled and rolled to the left.\u201d Another witness heard the accident airplane go to full power. The airplane was then in a 15- to 30-degree left bank with a nose-down attitude before it impacted the ground. The airplane\u2019s left wing impacted the ground first, then the airplane cartwheeled one-half turn. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no preimpact airframe or engine anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.About 8 months before the accident, the airplane's annual inspection was completed, and 2 days later the airplane's recoverable data module (RDM) stopped recording data due to a failed transient voltage suppressor (TVS) and did not record data during the accident flight. The airplane underwent a 100-hour inspection about midway through the 8 month period, and the failed RDM was not detected at that time. The system does not provide a failure indication to the pilot, and there is no requirement during the 100-hour inspection to check the RDM. A likely cause of the TVS failure could have been electrical overstress:  the airplane was tied down overnight, and lightning was present when the RDM stopped recording. A similar airplane sustained substantial lightning strike airframe and avionics damage while tied down and at least two other airplanes sustained lightning strikes at that time. An Air Force Research Lab report recommended that a \u201creview of the system design be conducted to determine if a cockpit indicator could be installed to alert the pilot when data logging is not functioning.\" ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain airplane control while on final approach with a gusting crosswind and the subsequent aerodynamic stall and spin during the attempted go-around."
