The airplane then entered a snow bank on the left side of the runway.  Service Difficulty Reports revealed other stall horn activation's had occurred on takeoff; several occurred after deicing and were attributed to frozen stall vanes on the wing.  The accident airplane had been deiced prior to the takeoff.  The BE1900 check list called for the stall vane heat to be turned on just before takeoff.  Stall training provided by the operator did not include BE1900 simulators, and all recoveries were initiated at the stall horn.  The FAA practical test standard for type ratings required the recognition of the stall buffet, stick shaker, or decay of control effectiveness.  The flight crew had not received winter operations training, and this was the Boston based PIC's third takeoff in snow.  Multiple FAA inspections over several years revealed the Operator was not in compliance with regulations, which included their training program; however, they continued to operate unrestricted.

Factors relating to the accident were an easterly crosswind, the narrow icy runway conditions, inadequate FAA oversight in allowing the operator to continue operations with an inadequate training program that continued over several years, and the manufacturer's checklist which delayed the activation of the stall vane heat until just prior to takeoff.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed. The local flight departed from the Boerne Stage Field Airport (5C1), San Antonio, Texas, at an unknown time.A witness who lived about .5 mile northeast of the accident site reported that he initially heard and then observed the airplane approaching from the northeast and flying to the southwest about 600 feet above ground level. The area the airplane was overflying was unpopulated and near the Government Canyon State Natural Area. When the airplane had flown about .5 miles to the southwest, he observed the nose of the airplane go straight up while simultaneously banking 90 degrees to the left. The airplane became fully inverted and then began to descend in a left bank. The witness reported that he expected to see the airplane pull up and level off at its original altitude and depart to the northeast as he had seen the airplane do many times before. However, this time, the airplane continued to descend nearly straight down until he lost sight of the airplane behind a hill and trees, and he heard a \"thud\" moments later. He reported that the engine was producing full power throughout the maneuver and he heard no indication of a momentary loss of engine power. There was no postimpact ground fire. The witness reported that he lived in the same neighborhood as the accident pilot and had previously seen the pilot perform similar maneuvers in the past.The airplane impacted hard, rocky terrain that contained juniper, mesquite, and oak trees.

According to the pilot, he was distracted by trying to locate the runway for a visual approach. A review of the \u201cBefore Landing\u201d and \u201cClose In\u201d checklists for the airplane revealed that both checklists contained landing gear verification tasks; however, although the copilot stated that he read from the checklist, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which captured other cockpit conversations, recorded no checklist challenge-response callouts. During the landing, the airplane touched down on the runway with its landing gear retracted and slid about 2,600 feet before coming to a stop, sustaining substantial damage to a structural component and fire damage to the bottom of the fuselage. Following touchdown, the CVR recorded that the pilot asked what happened to the landing gear and that the copilot responded, \u201cWe never put it down.\u201d Although the airplane was equipped with an audible landing gear warning system designed to alert the flight crew that the landing gear is not extended when the airplane is otherwise configured for landing, the CVR captured no sounds that could be associated with the landing gear warning horn, and the pilot reported that he did not hear a warning. Postaccident testing of the airplane\u2019s landing gear system revealed that it operated normally using the normal and emergency extension systems and that the cockpit landing gear visual annunciators and standby indicators correctly indicated the landing gear position. However, the audible landing gear warning system did not operate. Examination of the electrical wiring for the warning system revealed that a wire labeled \u201c68CA8\u201d was fractured and separated from the \u201cCA\u201d relay; this separation rendered the landing gear warning horn inoperative. Metallurgical examination of the 68CA8 wire revealed that the fracture features were consistent with overstress; however, the source of the overstress condition was not identified. According to the airplane\u2019s maintenance records, the CA relay and its immediate area were inspected 7 months and 22 days before the accident, and the airplane had operated for 60 hours (accumulating 43 cycles) since the inspection. According to the airplane manufacturer, there is no preflight test that a flight crew could perform to determine the operational status of the audible landing gear warning system. However, because the audible landing gear warning system and the cabin altitude warning system shared the CA relay, the fractured 68CA8 wire would also have rendered the cabin altitude warning system inoperative, and the operational status of the cabin altitude warning system is a preflight check item for flight crews. Therefore, the anomaly that rendered the gear warning system inoperative would be detectable during a flight crew\u2019s preflight check because the cabin altitude warning would fail to function. However, a review of available maintenance and discrepancy records revealed no indication that any flight crews had previously detected and reported an inoperative cabin altitude warning system, and the accident crewmembers provided no information about their preflight observations of the status of the cabin altitude warning system. Therefore, it could not be determined when the 68CA8 wire fracture occurred.The pilot was employed by the airplane\u2019s owner. The investigation found that the pilot\u2019s U.S. commercial airman certificate (issued on the basis of his Mexican pilot license) was not valid for the carriage of persons for compensation or hire. Further, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records indicated that the pilot did not hold a U.S. airman medical certificate and that his U.S. airman certificate did not include a type rating for the accident airplane or an instrument rating (the accident flight was operated under instrument flight rules). Additionally, the pilot had not completed a pilot proficiency check within the preceding 12 calendar months. Further, the copilot held only a U.S. private pilot certificate (issued on the basis of his Mexican pilot license) that did not include an instrument rating. Although there is insufficient evidence to indicate that any of these flight crew discrepancies were directly related to the cause of the accident, the FAA determined that these discrepancies represented noncompliance with numerous Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). According to the FARs, the pilot was not authorized to act as pilot-in-command of the accident flight, and the copilot was not authorized to act as a required crewmember of the accident flight.",

The subsequent atomization and ignition of this fuel resulted in a localized area of increased temperature and non-uniform thermal damage to the second- and third-stage turbine stators.  The localized area of increased temperature resulted in thermal damage to the second- and third-stage turbine rotors, and increased second- and third-stage turbine rotor blade tip clearance, rendering the engine incapable of producing full power.

Airspeed decayed to approximately 115 knots and pitch attitude increased to about 11 degrees. The Delta 757/767 Flight Crew Training Manual specifies that contact with the runway is possible with pitch attitude greater than 10.5 degrees, with flaps 25 and airspeed of 10 knots below Vref.The airplane rolled out and taxied to the gate uneventfully.

Aircraft inspection revealed an 8 foot scrape on the lower aft fuselage, damage to several stringers and buckling of the aft pressurization dome.",

The pilot (plt) was instructed to descend & cross the STILL Intersection (Int) at 3,000 ft. STILL Int was aligned with the localizer (loc) approach (apch) course, 10.1 mi from the apch end of runway 17 (rwy 17); the final apch fix (FAF) was 3.9 mi from the rwy. About 5 mi before reaching STILL Int, while on course & level at 3,000 ft, the plt was cleared for a Loc Rwy 17 Apch. Radar data showed the aircraft (acft) continued to STILL Int, then it turned onto the loc course toward the FAF. Shortly after departing STILL Int, while inbound on the loc course, the acft began a descent. Before the acft reached the FAF, the DC issued a frequency change to go to UNICOM. During this transmission, the IC noticed a low altitude alert on the radar display, then issued a verbal low altitude alert, saying, 'check altitude, you should be at 1,500 ft (should have said '1,800 ft' as that was the minimum crossing altitude at the FAF), altitude's indicating 1,200, low altitude alert.'  There was no response from the plt. This occurred about 2 mi before the FAF. Minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the apch was 720 ft. The acft struck tree tops at 750 ft, about 1/2 mi before the FAF. The IC's remark 'you should be at 1,500 ft' was based on an expired apch plate with a lower FAF minimum crossing altitude; the current minimum crossing altitude at the FAF was 1,800 ft. Apch control management had not made the current plate available to the controllers.

While resetting the global position system (GPS), the pilot-in-command (PIC) transferred controls to the pilot-rated-passenger. While the PIC was trying to reduce the sensitivity of the GPS warning system, the helicopter made a right turn of almost 260 degrees of heading change, allowing the helicopter to be on a perpendicular ground track and traveling directly toward the power lines. The helicopter collided with the topmost lines in the set, which were the grounding wires for the transmission line. The helicopter was observed by an eyewitness impacting the power line and descending to the ground. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any mechanical deficiencies. Several witnesses heard the helicopter and reported that it sounded normal prior to impacting the power lines. The main rotor blade was separated from the main wreckage.  The pilot-rated-passenger had a history that he had not revealed to the Federal Aviation Administration of kidney stones, severe knee pain, and regular use of prescription pain medication. This pilot had seen an orthopedic surgeon the day before the accident for continuing knee pain, for which he had requested and received additional pain medication \"to help him sleep.\" Toxicological testing was consistent with the recent use of the potentially impairing narcotic medication that had been prescribed the day before the accident.

The flight lead pilot was provided an air traffic control (ATC) frequency change from Miami Center to Tampa Approach. The flight was unable to establish communications with Tampa Approach because an incorrect radio frequency was given to the flight lead by Miami Center. The flight lead reestablished radio contact with Miami Center, cancelled the flight's IFR clearance, and proceeded under visual flight rules (VFR). The controller acknowledged the cancellation, advised the F-16 flight lead pilot of traffic in his vicinity, and asked the flight lead pilot if he wanted VFR flight following (a service that includes VFR radar traffic advisories on a workload-permitting basis.). The flight lead pilot declined.  The Miami Center controller then informed Tampa Approach that the flight lead pilot had elected to terminate ATC services, but did not specify that there were two aircraft in the flight.  Tampa Approach procedures did not require that the controllers use flight strips (which would have included the number of aircraft in the formation), so the Tampa controllers had no other information indicating that there were multiple aircraft present.  Continuing their descent under VFR, the two F-16s assumed the \u201cfighting wing\u201d formation. This placed the accident F-16 on the left side of the lead aircraft and approximately 0.7 miles in trail.  The accident F-16\u2019s transponder was inactive, as is normal for formation operations, making the aircraft significantly less conspicuous on ATC radar than it would be with an operating transponder.  At an unknown point in the flight, the F-16 lead pilot\u2019s navigation system developed a position error and was indicating that the aircraft was several miles from its actual position.  The pilot failed to recognize the error, and was attempting to visually locate the entry point for the training route based on the erroneous navigation data. Because of the lead pilot\u2019s loss of situational awareness, the two F-16s inadvertently descended into the Class C airspace surrounding the Sarasota, Florida airport without establishing required communications with ATC.  Meanwhile, a Cessna 172 pilot departed Sarasota under VFR and contacted Tampa Approach.  The Cessna pilot was instructed by the developmental controller receiving instruction to maintain 1,600 feet, turn left to a heading of 320-degrees, and to follow the shoreline. At 15:47:10, he was instructed to climb and maintain 3,500 feet. Miami Center contacted Tampa Approach at 15:47:55, and asked for the altitude of the F-16s. Although the Tampa controller was not in contact with the F-16s, he was able to locate the flight lead on the radar display and informed Miami that the flight lead was at 2,000 feet. A conflict alert between the lead F-16 and the Cessna activated 10 times between 15:47:39 and 15:48:03. The developmental controller stated that he heard an alarm, but could not recall where it was. The controller providing the instruction did not recall if he saw or heard a conflict alert, and no conflict alert was issued. There was no alert generated between the accident F-16 and the Cessna because the conflict alert system requires that both aircraft involved have operating transponders.  The developmental controller informed the Cessna pilot at 15:48:09 that he had traffic off his left side, but received no response.  The controllers were unaware of the position of the other (accident) F-16 in the formation flight.  At 15:48:53, the lead F-16 transmitted, \u201cMayday, mayday.\u201d  At 15:49:14, the flight lead pilot followed with, \"Mayday, mayday, mayday, F-16 down.\"  Examination of the wreckage of both airplanes determined that the accident F-16's left wing and cockpit area collided with the Cessna 172's right forward side (nose) and cabin area.",

The check airman, who was giving a multiengine check ride to a private pilot, asked the pilot to conduct a short field landing.  The check airman believed that they were too low while on final approach, with the landing gear and flaps extended.  He asked the pilot if he thought everything was O.K.  The pilot did not respond, so the check airman initiated a go-around by applying full power and retracting the landing gear.  During the application of power for the go-around, the left engine failed to produce full power.  The airplane veered to the left and its left wing impacted the ground.  Pertinent sections of the pilot's operating handbook for the Beech B95 were reviewed.  The recommended approach speed for a short field landing is 82 mph indicated airspeed, while best single engine rate of climb airspeed (Vyse) is 100 mph indicated.  The procedure specified for a single engine go-around is as follows:  1) Apply full power to operating engine; 2) retract landing gear and close cowl flaps on dead engine; 3) retract flaps to half extension initially, then fully retract the flaps as soon as practical thereafter.  The single engine rate of climb chart predicts a 160-foot-per-minute positive climb at the pressure altitude and temperature existing at the accident site; however, this performance is predicated on the airplane being in the following configuration:  1) at Vyse; 2) gear and flaps retracted; 3) inoperative engine's propeller feathered; 4) 5-degree bank into the operating engine.  Any deviation from the listed single engine climb configuration would result in a degradation of the climb performance.  Given that the airplane was likely in an energy deficient state some 15 to 18 mph below best single engine climb airspeed and not in the proper configuration for a single engine go-around when the loss of power in the left engine became apparent, a successful outcome for the maneuver was in doubt.

The preflight brief did not address whether or not the parachutists would drift over the crowd at the airfield or not. During takeoff, the two parachutists were standing on the lower wing to the left and right of the cockpit and gripping the handhold on the upper wing surface. They were not wearing safety harnesses.

As the airplane started to descend, the pilot appeared to attempt to turn left in order to land on a crossing runway (Runway 32), but during the turn the airplane appeared to stall and descend into the terrain. The airplane was recovered, and the engine, which had been highly modified for racing, was torn down and inspected. No pre-impact anomalies or malfunctions were discovered during the teardown, except that the exhaust system heat wrap covering near the crankcase breather was covered by a film of oil residue. The conclusion of the owner was that the increase in power and the pitch of the newly installed propeller allowed the engine to overspeed, resulting in the pressurization of the crankcase, and the ejection of an oil mist onto the exhaust system heat wrap. The owner believes that this resulted in the creation of smoke that got into the cockpit, which likely lead the pilot to believe that he may have had an in-flight fire. The pilot, thinking he may have had an in-flight fire, shut the engine down, and attempted a landing on the crossing runway.  This was the first flight of the airplane since the engine had been modified to produce more power, and since the airframe had been modified in an attempt to achieve a higher race airspeed. According to the owner, the engine was operating at a compression ratio of 13.5 to 1, and with the newly installed propeller, the engine had reached an on-ground static speed of 3,800 rpm.",

He selected a forced landing area in a clearing, but the airplane entered trees before reaching the clearing and came to rest upright in flat, heavily wooded terrain.

While approaching the airport, the pilot requested vectors for a localizer approach to runway 19.  Due to traffic, air traffic control (ATC) issued the pilot a holding clearance.  The airplane was approaching the holding fix about 8,000 feet, when the pilot advised ATC that the airplane was picking up a little ice.  ATC initially offered an amended clearance of 9,000 feet, but the pilot declined.  Subsequently, he accepted the clearance and climbed back to 9,000 feet.  ATC then told the pilot that after one more airplane had landed, he would be issued an approach clearance.  The airplane was about 9,200 feet when the pilot replied \"thank you.\"  Review of radar data revealed that the accident airplane made one complete 360-degree turn, and one 270-degree turn on the non-holding side of the published holding pattern.  During the two turns, the airplane descended to approximately 8,400 feet, climbed to 8,900 feet, then descended again to 8,300 feet.

Following the two holding turns, no more radio transmissions or radar returns were received by ATC.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.

The pilot was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The private pilot and the pilot's private pilot rated father sustained fatal injuries. Only remnants of the airplane have been recovered. The cross-country personal flight was departing en route nonstop to Honolulu (PHNL), Hawaii. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed, and a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan had been filed.One ground crewman and his wife met the pilot and his father at the airport to support the departure, and observed the pilot completing preflight checks. The ground crewman queried if they were going to depart, and the father replied yes noting that the weather was great. The ground crewman stated that the wind had been gusty and strong all day and evening. He observed the airplane taxi for departure, and repositioned himself so that he could observe the whole runway for the takeoff.As the airplane moved down the runway, the ground crewman noted that the wind was very strong. The airplane became airborne, but it was moving up and down and side to side; it also was not gaining altitude. At this point, the airplane had passed the very high frequency omni-directional radio range, tactical air navigation (VORTAC), but was still very low. Before the airplane reached the end of the runway, it banked to the right towards the ocean. Over the next few seconds, the airplane kept getting lower, and then disappeared. He did not observe it contact the water; he only saw the lights getting lower and lower. He observed no explosion, and heard no noise.The ground crewman stated that he contacted the airport duty supervisor to determine if there had been any contact with the airplane. The supervisor responded that he was waiting for a call from the pilot after the takeoff, and the ground crewman reported that he thought it went into the ocean.Another witness was a couple of miles away sitting on a seawall facing the airport. He reported that the engine was loud as the airplane was taking off. He reported that it was unusual that the airplane did not immediately gain altitude. He stated that a few seconds after takeoff, the airplane suddenly went nose down into the water.The American Samoa Department of Public Safety located the pilot's body at 0040; it was strapped to a seat cushion. They reported burn marks on the body, and a strong odor of gasoline. They recovered a life raft, a survival suit and clothing, a fuselage piece, a duffel bag, and two gumby suits along with other debris.A pilot who was very experienced in transoceanic flights had been in contact with the pilot's father for several months during the planning of the trip, as well as during the trip. On the day of departure, the father indicated that the airplane had 249 gallons of fuel on board, and anticipated a 2300 departure time so that he and his son could land in Hawaii during daylight hours. He had purchased two life vests for them to wear instead of the gumby suits. He indicated that they planned to take off with 10 degrees of flaps, accelerate in ground effect, start a slow climb to 200 feet, retract the landing gear, climb to 500 feet and retract the flaps, and then climb to 5,000 feet and level out. Once the power and fuel settings were established for cruise, they would initiate a shallow climb to 7,000 feet, maintain that for 2-3 hours, and then establish a shallow climb to 9,000 feet.",

The cracks followed the grain flow lines resulting from forging.  Flow lines were longitudinal in the arm portion of the brace with a smooth, gently curving transition into the thicker portion of the lug.  However, flow lines in the upper fracture were convoluted and tightly twisted.  A laboratory-induced fracture of the brace revealed an irregular boundary with ductile overstress features interspersed along the edge of the crack.  Low magnification revealed a smooth, undulating surface.  High magnification revealed a fine granular texture.  Energy dispersive x-ray spectra revealed an increased oxygen level on the crack surface.",
            "probable_cause": "Failure of the nose landing gear upper drag brace assembly due to overload acting on an undetected forging defect formed during the initial forging of the brace.  A contributing factor in this accident was the runway distance remaining sign."

The pilot was bound for an airstrip near his work, about 65 miles north-northeast of the departure airport.  An FAA inspector who spoke to the accident pilot the morning of the flight, said the weather at the departure airport was marginal VFR, with horizontal visibility as little as 100 feet along the road to the airport, and the peaks and ridges obscured by low clouds.  The area weather forecast included thunderstorms and high winds.  The airplane's wreckage was located about 12 miles west-southwest of the destination airport.

The airplane landed hard, and the right main landing gear, a spring steel strut, fractured and separated from the fuselage just outboard of the landing gear fuselage support clamp.  The airplane settled onto the belly-mounted cargo pod and sustained minor damage.   The airplane had accrued about 17,120 total flight hours.  The right main gear was replaced in 1994, at an aircraft total time of 11,848 hours, with a \"serviceable unit.\" Visual examination of the fracture surface revealed beach marks radiating in successive arc patterns from mulitple locations, along the underside of the gear strut.  A metallurgical examination revealed that the landing gear spring had two different layers of paint.  Multiple fatigue crack initiation sites, coinciding with corrosion pits, were found along the lower surface of the gear.  Particles in the pits contained titanium, a component of paint, indicating the corrosion pits were present at the time the gear was painted.  Periodic visual inspection of the landing gear is required by 14 CFR Part 43.  Neither the manufacturer nor the FAA have established time in service limits (hours or cycles) for the main landing gear strut.  Removal of the gear strut for inspection, or the use of nondestructive inspection techniques is not required by the manufacturer or the FAA.  On March 16, 2001, the NTSB recommended that the FAA issue an airworthiness directive (AD) to require an initial and recurring inspection of Cessna main landing gear spring steel struts, using nondestructive inspection techniques.  On August 31, 2001, the FAA reported to the NTSB that the current inspection criteria outlined in the Cessna Maintenance Manual are adequate to detect cracks in the main landing gear struts, and that additional airworthiness action is not warranted.  On March 25, 2002, the NTSB responded by stating, in part:  \"The Safety Board continues to believe that a visual inspection alone will not detect cracks in the Cessna main landing gear spring struts.  However, the Safety Board acknowledges that the statistical evidence does not warrant issuance of ADs at this time as called for in the Board's recommendation.\"  The safety recommendation was then classified as: \"Closed-Reconsidered.\"",

After the landing, the pilot and the designated pilot examiner noticed that two of the propeller blades had separated from the propeller hub.

The powdery wood observed in the slots and at the root end of the blade shank were indicative of rubbing wood as the cracks progressed. The blade B fracture was likely secondary and occurred due to the vibrations associated with the imbalance created by the blade A fracture and subsequent separation. The propeller log indicated that manufacturer-specified visual inspections and torque checks were not conducted at the specified interval of 150 hours but at intervals of about 203, 320, and 250 hours.

From the air, the freshly mowed overrun looked acceptable, with the eight to nine foot high stand of scotch bloom showing as a dark green from the air and appearing to be grass.  He slipped to a landing, touched down straight and was tracking near the middle of the mowed area when his right wing tip caught in the scotch bloom.  The vegetation pulled the aircraft off the right side of the runway, and the lower left wing impacted the ground, causing substantial damage.

The ultralight-like aircraft consisted of an aluminum tube framework with a single seat, an open fuselage, and fabric-covered aerodynamic surfaces, and was powered by a 60-horsepower engine and was equipped with a rocket-powered parachute. The next day, the pilot flew about 15 miles to another private airstrip and flew back to the gathering a few hours later. Although the gathering was scheduled to continue one more day, in the late afternoon, the pilot decided to depart for his home airport. Before his departure, he had a brief discussion about the headwind with another association member. When the aircraft was about halfway to its destination, in a region of mountainous terrain, two witnesses observed it flying about 400 feet above the ground. They believed the aircraft to be in trouble because the wings were rocking. The aircraft made a 270-degree turn, pitched up and over to the inverted position, and began a steep, nose-down descent. The pilot deployed the rocket-powered aircraft parachute, but the parachute did not arrest the descent. The aircraft struck the ground in a steep trajectory in a steep nose-down attitude. Examination of the aircraft did not reveal any preimpact mechanical failures or deficiencies that would have prevented continued flight or the deployment and functioning of the parachute system.

Witnesses also reported that it was very windy, and one ultralight pilot familiar with the area reported that the area was notorious for strong winds and rotors. Although the pilot was not the owner, he was considered to be highly experienced and quite familiar with the aircraft. Although the specific reasons for the failure of the parachute to arrest the descent could not be determined, the high wind, turbulence, initial descent attitude and trajectory, and low deployment altitude likely all contributed to that failure. Additionally, the pilot regularly left the safety pin for the parachute activation handle in during flight, which may have delayed his activation of the system.",

A pilot-rated acquaintance agreed to assist the owner by flying him to the airplane and then accompanying him back home in it. The retrieval flight was filed as an instrument flight rules flight. Visual flight rules conditions prevailed at the departure airport. After takeoff, as the airplane turned onto the crosswind leg, it was observed to cease its climb and then roll into a stall/spin until impact with the ground. Witnesses reported that the propeller was not rotating, but physical evidence was inconclusive. The airplane was not equipped with a stall warning system. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact mechanical failures, but both the ignition switch and the fuel selector valve were found in their respective \"off\" positions. While it is clear that the airplane stalled and impacted the ground in uncontrolled flight, the precipitating event(s) could not be determined. Equal cases could be made that the positions of the ignition switch and the fuel selector valve were causal to the stall (through inadvertent manipulation, and resulting distraction), or that they were reactions to the stall and imminent ground impact (to reduce the fire hazard). Toxicological testing detected Donepezil and another medication in the owner's liver and kidney tissue. Donepezil (also known by the trade name \"Aricept\") was used almost exclusively to help treat the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neither medication would normally be expected to result in significant impairment, but the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease would be expected to result in impairment. The investigation was unable to determine when or why the Donepezil was prescribed, or the cognitive condition of the owner. The available evidence suggested that his cognitive condition, if it was in fact diminished, was not apparent to others. The specific roles and actions of the two pilots during the accident flight could not be determined, but the evidence suggested that the owner acted as pilot in command and that he operated the controls. The investigation was unable to determine the extent of the acquaintance's knowledge of the owner's cognitive abilities and limitations or whether he was aware that the owner no longer held a valid FAA medical certificate. Evidence suggested that the acquaintance had little to no knowledge about the airplane\u2019s operation or performance characteristics. The effect of the owner's extensive aviation experience on the acquaintance's judgment and decision-making could not be determined.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The flight was being vectored for the approach to runway 3R at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport  (DTW) when the aircraft descended and impacted the ground.  The aircraft struck the ground in a steep nose-down attitude in a level field in a rural area about 19 nm southwest of DTW.  The flight carried 26 passengers and 3 crew members.  There were no survivors and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The investigation revealed that it was likely that the airplane gradually accumulated a thin, rough glaze/mixed ice coverage on the leading edge deicing boot surfaces, possibly with ice ridge formation on the leading edge upper surface, as the airplane descended from 7,000 feet mean sea level (msl) to 4,000 feet msl in icing conditions, which may have been imperceptible to the pilots.  The pilots had been instructed by air traffic control to slow to 150 knots and according to flight data recorder information, the airplane began to show signs of departure from controlled flight as it decelerated from 155 to 156 knots while in a flaps-up configuration.  The investigation disclosed that the FAA failed to adopt a systematic and proactive approach to the certification, and operational issues of turbopropeller-driven transport airplane icing.  The icing certification process has been inadequate because it has not required manufacturers to demonstrate the airplane's flight handling and stall characteristics under a sufficiently realistic range of adverse ice accretion/flight handling conditions.  The aircraft manufacturer had issued a revision in April, 1996 to the approved flight manual which included activation of the leading edge deicing boots at the first sign of ice formation.  The airplane operator did not incorporate the procedure, because it was contrary to the company's  trained procedures and practices and of the belief that enacting the changes would result in potentially unsafe operation.  Investigators' discussion with management personnel at each of the seven U.S.-based operators of the aircraft indicated that at the time of the accident only two of these operators had changed their procedures to reflect the information in the revision.  The FAA, at the time of the accident, did not require manufacturers of all turbine-engine driven airplanes to publish  minimum airspeed information for various flap configurations and phases and conditions of flight.  During Safety Board investigators postaccident interviews with company pilots, there were inconsistent answers on the complex and varied minimum airspeed requirements established by the company  for both icing and nonicing conditions.  It was also noted that the pilots uncertainty of the appropriate airspeeds might have been associated with the language used, the different airspeeds and criteria contained in the guidance, the company's methods of distribution, and the company's failure t o incorporate the guidance as a formal, permanent revision to the flight standards manual.

            "probable_cause": "The Federal Aviation Adminstration's (FAA) failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions, the FAA's failure to ensure that at Centro Tecnico Aeroespacial/FAA-approved  procedure for the accident airplane's deice system operation was implemented by U.S.-based air carriers, and the FAA's failure to require the establishment of adequate minimum airspeeds for icing conditions, which led to the loss of control when the airplane accumulated a thin, rough, accretion of ice on its lifting surfaces.  Contributing to the accident were the flightcrew's decision to operate in icing conditions near the lower margin of the operating airspeed envelope (with flaps retracted) and Comair's failure to establish and adequately disseminate unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions.

He attempted to apply corrective control inputs; however, the airplane departed the runway and struck a powered parachute, which was parked on the adjacent taxi area. The pilot elected to continue the takeoff, and flew an additional hour to his destination airport. Witnesses also reported that, soon after the airplane began its takeoff roll, it swerved onto the taxiway, continuing its takeoff attempt almost to the end of the runway, where it struck the powered parachute. The airplane sustained substantial damage, which included a 12-inch-wide gash in the fuselage structure stretching from the baggage door to the aft of the tailcone. Both witness reports, and official weather observations, indicated that a strong quartering tailwind existed on the departure runway at the time of the accident. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.",

A pilot entering the traffic pattern at the time that the accident pilot was conducting takeoffs and landings reported that, during the accident pilot\u2019s third landing, the accident airplane was \u201cextremely low,\u201d not more than 200 feet above ground level (agl), on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern. He noted that the normal pattern altitude was 800 feet agl. He stated that the accident pilot subsequently landed and took off again and that he observed the accident airplane on initial climb after takeoff and beginning to turn to the crosswind leg, but that he did not observe the remainder of the accident pilot\u2019s flight in the traffic pattern or the accident sequence. There were no other witnesses. The student pilot was approaching for a fourth landing when the accident occurred; the airplane came to rest inverted short of the runway threshold. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. The damage to the nose of the airplane is consistent with a high-impact angle of about 45 degrees. The high-impact angle and lack of significant ground travel after impact is consistent with a loss of control precipitated by an inadvertent aerodynamic stall.",
