The flight instructor read the before-landing checklist, and the pilot-rated student extended the landing gear. The flight instructor put his hand on the landing gear handle to verify that the landing gear was down because he could not see the green light from where he was sitting. According to the pilot-rated student, he extended the landing gear on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, saw the green landing gear indicator light, and felt the vibrations and heard the sounds associated with the landing gear extension. They continued onto the base and final leg of the traffic pattern and landed the airplane. The pilots described what initially felt like a normal landing roll but then the main landing gear collapsed and the airplane's empennage began scraping the runway. The airplane came to rest on the left side of the runway centerline. A postaccident examination revealed that the main landing gear had collapsed while the nose gear remained locked in the down position. A postaccident examination of the runway revealed tire marks that were about 5 to 6 feet apart, narrowing to 2 to 3 feet apart leading to the airplane. According to guidance provided by the manufacturer, the distance between the two main landing gear tires with the gear fully extended was 8 feet and 6 inches, indicating that the landing gear was likely not fully deployed at touchdown.

The airplane returned to SLC for an overweight, single-engine landing without further incident. Examination of the engine revealed that two fan blades were fractured transversely across the airfoil adjacent to the blade root platform. Metallurgical examination of the fan blades determined that one fan blade had separated from a fatigue fracture and the other separated from overload, although the fracture had coincided with a preexisting fatigue crack. A fluorescent penetrant examination of the left engine's remaining fan blades revealed that several blades had crack indications. A dimensional inspection of the cracked fan blades revealed that they were under the minimum thickness in a highly stressed area of the airfoil. The investigation determined that the fan blades were too thin due to an improper forging die setup when the blades were manufactured. At the time the fan blades were made, PWC did not require a dimensional inspection of the fan blade airfoils.",

Hanscom Field (BED), Bedford, Massachusetts. The two pilots, a flight attendant, and four passengers were fatally injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight destined for Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Atlantic City, New Jersey. The business flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The airplane was based at New Castle Airport (ILG), Wilmington, Delaware, and co-owned by one of the passengers, through a limited liability company. According to preliminary information, the airplane departed ILG earlier in the day, flew to ACY, and then to BED. The airplane landed at BED about 1545 and remained parked on the ramp at one of the fixed base operators. The crew remained with the airplane until the passengers returned. No maintenance or fuel services were requested by the crew. The airplane was subsequently cleared for takeoff from runway 11, a 7,011-foot-long, 150-foot wide, grooved, asphalt runway. A witness observed the airplane on the takeoff roll at a \"high speed\" with \"little to no altitude gained.\" The airplane subsequently rolled off the end of the runway, on to a runway safety area, and then on to grass. The airplane continued on the grass, where it struck approach lighting and a localizer antenna assembly, before coming to rest in a gully, on about runway heading, about 1,850 feet from the end of the runway. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the airplane aft of the cockpit; however; all major portions of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site. The nose gear and left main landing gear separated during the accident sequence and were located on the grass area between the safety area and the gully.Tire marks consistent with braking were observed to begin about 1,300 feet from the end of runway 11. The tire marks continued for about another 1,000 feet through the paved runway safety area.The airplane was equipped with an L-3 Communications FA-2100 cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and an L-3 Communications F1000 flight data recorder (FDR), which were recovered and forwarded to the Safety Board's Vehicle Recorders Laboratory, Washington, DC for readout.Initial review of CVR and FDR data revealed that the airplane's ground roll began about 49 seconds before the end of the CVR recording. The CVR captured callouts of 80 knots, V1, and rotate. After the rotate callout, the CVR captured comments concerning aircraft control. FDR data indicated the airplane reached a maximum speed of 165 knots during the takeoff roll and did not lift off the runway. FDR data further indicated thrust reversers were deployed and wheel brake pressures increased as the airplane decelerated. The FDR data ended about 7 seconds after thrust reverser deployment, with the airplane at about 100 knots. The FDR data did not reveal evidence of any catastrophic engine failures and revealed thrust lever angles consistent with observed engine performance. Review of FDR data parameters associated with the flight control surface positions did not reveal any movement consistent with a flight control check prior to the commencement of the takeoff roll. The flap handle in the cockpit was observed in the 10 degree detent. FDR data indicated a flap setting of 20 degrees during the takeoff attempt.The airplane was equipped with a mechanical gust lock system, which could be utilized to lock the ailerons and rudder in the neutral position, and the elevator in the down position to protect the control surfaces from wind gusts while parked. A mechanical interlock was incorporated in the gust lock handle mechanism to restrict the movement of the throttle levers to a minimal amount (6-percent) when the gust lock handle was engaged.The FDR data revealed the elevator control surface position during the taxi and takeoff was consistent with its position if the gust lock was engaged. The gust lock handle, located on the right side of the control pedestal, was found in the forward (OFF) position, and the elevator gust lock latch was found not engaged.The wreckage was retained for further examination to be performed at a later date. The airplane was also equipped with a quick-access-recorder (QAR), which was retained for download. The certificated airplane transport pilot, who was seated in the right seat, reported 18,500 hours of total flight experience on his most recent application for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) first-class medical certificate, which was issued on February 4, 2014.The certificated airline transport copilot, who was seated in the left seat, reported 11,250 hours of total flight experience on his most recent application for an FAA first-class medical certificate, which was issued on April 15, 2014.Both pilots completed a Gulfstream IV recurrent pilot-in-command course and proficiency check during September 2013. At that time, the pilot and copilot reported 2,800 and 1,400 hours of total flight experience in G-IV series airplanes; respectively. Initial review of maintenance records revealed that at the time of the accident, the airplane had been operated for about 4,950 total hours and 2,745 landings.The reported weather at BED, at 2156, included calm winds, visibility 10 miles; clear skies; temperature 8 degrees Celsius (C); dew point 6 degrees C; altimeter 30.28 inches of mercury.",

The day of the accident the pilot obtained a preflight weather briefing, added 3 gallons of 100 low lead fuel to the main fuel tank which brought the amount of fuel in the 21-gallon tank to approximately 75 percent capacity or 15 gallons.  He also performed weight and balance calculations which indicated that at the time of takeoff, the airplane was approximately 50 pounds under maximum gross weight.  He estimated the takeoff roll to be 715 feet based on the temperature, and airplane weight at the time of takeoff; he added 20 percent to the calculated distance for the grass runway.  He performed a preflight inspection of the airplane two times using the checklist; one time was in the presence of the passenger; no fuel contamination was noted.  The passenger boarded the airplane and was briefed on the emergency procedures; the passenger also received help donning his seat restraint consisting of a lap belt and shoulder harness.

After being cleared to takeoff by the marshaller, he applied the brakes and increased power to 75 percent, then checked the engine gauges.  He then released the brakes and applied full power noting the tachometer indicated 5,600 rpm (yellow arc).

Witnesses reported that the pilot positioned the airplane to have all runway available for takeoff.  The engine was heard to accelerate to what one witness thought was full power while the brakes were applied.  The airplane was observed to start the takeoff roll during which time several witnesses reported seeing the airplane in a nose high attitude and the bottom portion of the empennage contacting the runway at least one time.  The airplane was observed becoming airborne after the end of the runway only because of a lower elevation, then impacted terrain while in a tail low attitude.  The airplane then nosed over and came to rest inverted.  No unusual sounds were reported from the engine during the takeoff roll.  One witness reported that the wind shifted during the takeoff and when the airplane was 1/2 way down the runway, the wind was from the southeast at 4-5 knots; the wind had been favoring departures from runway 27.  Examination of the accident site revealed the airplane impacted terrain approximately 101.4 feet past the departure end of the runway, and came to rest inverted approximately 97.4 feet from the initial impact point.  The elevation of the impact point was approximately 10-15 feet lower than the runway elevation.  Examination of the airplane following recovery by the NTSB revealed flight control continuity for roll, pitch, and yaw.  The fuel selector valve was found in the \"on\" position, and calculations indicate that 14.7 gallons of 100 low lead fuel were drained from the fuselage tank; no contaminants were noted.  Examination of the tail fairing revealed evidence of being scraped and ground down.  Grass debris was noted inside the fairing.  Examination of the cockpit revealed the propeller control was set to \"Auto\" and \"21.\"  The flaps were examined post accident and found to be retracted.  Examination of the runway which was later determined to be 1,423 feet in length revealed no determination could be made as to where the empennage contacted the runway surface.  Examination of the engine revealed suction and compression from all cylinders.  The left carburetor bowl contained 100 low lead fuel, while the right carburetor bowl contained only residual 100 low lead fuel.  All 3 propeller blades were shattered near the hub.  No evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction of the engine was noted.  Examination of the propeller revealed that all 3 propeller blades were estimated to be between 20 and 25 degrees; low blade angle is set to 13.5 degrees plus or minus 0.2 degree.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot-in-command to abort the takeoff after recognizing that the airplane did not become airborne at the calculated point down the runway.  A contributing factor in the accident was the windshift during the takeoff roll resulting in a quartering tailwind.  A finding in the investigation was the excessive elevator flight control input by the pilot in command resulting in empennage to runway contact during the takeoff roll."

The airplane came to rest about 1 mile east of the destination airport. Ground scars and wreckage signatures showed a high-angle, low-energy impact in a steep nose-down, left-bank attitude that is consistent with an in-flight loss of control and a stall/spin. The pilot's handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit was recovered in the wreckage and the information was downloaded. Several trail points were identified; however, the unit did not record date and time stamps so no airspeed or altitude points were available. The recorded trail data only contained latitude and longitude information. The data points showed a downwind departure from the flight\u2019s origin airport and then stopped just short of the approach end of the runway, near where the accident occurred.  The distance between the two airports was approximately 50 nautical miles, with the destination airport east-southeast of the departure airport.

The pilot also had a handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit mounted in the cockpit. During the VOR correlation effort, the pilot noticed on the GPS that he was about to intrude into restricted airspace. (Although this particular airspace is only restricted at certain times, the GPS always depicts the boundaries, regardless of the airspace restriction status.) He initiated a turn to avoid the restricted airspace and monitored the GPS display to ensure that he would clear the restricted area. When he returned his attention to the airplane, he noticed that the bank angle was about 75 degrees, the pitch attitude was about 20 degrees airplane nose down, and the airspeed was about 190 mph, which was in the yellow (caution) range of the airspeed indicator scale. The pilot leveled the wings and initiated a pull-up, during which he heard three or four \"thumps\" in rapid succession. After recovery to level flight, the airplane seemed normal, but the pilot's concern about the thumps prompted him to return to his home airport where he landed uneventfully. The pilot estimated that he loaded the airplane to about 2g during the pullout, while a cockpit mounted g-meter registered a maximum loading of about 2.5g. Postflight examination of the airplane revealed that the aft fuselage side skins were wrinkled and that the aft fuselage lower skin was torn. Detailed evaluation of the ruddervator system revealed some minor discrepancies in control surface travel ranges. Damage patterns were consistent with in-flight overload and were not consistent with flutter. Review of airplane certification requirements and the in-flight events indicated that the airplane was in the region of its flight envelope where flight control inputs could result in structural damage. The control surface travel discrepancies did not contribute to the ability of the pilot to induce the observed structural damage. Because the restricted airspace is not continuously active, notification of its active status is provided via  a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), which is issued 2 hours in advance of the restriction. The airspace status can also be determined on a real-time basis via radio communications with the controlling facility. The pilot had not checked the NOTAMs and was not in communication with the controlling facility, and he was therefore unaware of the airspace status at the time of his near-penetration of the airspace. Because he was unaware of the status of the airspace, he took evasive action to avoid it, although such action was unnecessary because the airspace was not restricted at the time of the flight. Adequate preflight planning would have allowed the pilot to determine the status of the restricted airspace and would have obviated the need for the avoidance maneuver, which ultimately resulted in structural damage to the airplane. In addition, when it became apparent to the pilot that he was about to penetrate the airspace, he prioritized avoidance of the airspace above retaining control of the airplane, which was a reversal of the \"aviate, navigate\" priority hierarchy necessary for safe operation of any aircraft.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to prioritize flying over navigation due to his diverted attention, which allowed the airplane to near a restricted area, which, in turn, led the pilot to enter a rapid avoidance maneuver and subsequently lose airplane control. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to adequately prepare for the flight."

UNICOM informed him that runway 16 was the preferred runway.  He noted that the airport had a hill, which had silos on it, on the approach end of the runway.  He maintained what he felt was a safe vertical separation from the silos, and came in a bit high as he set up for the landing.  During his flare, he became aware that the runway sloped uphill.  He was below the crest, and could not see how long the runway continued past it.  He decided to go around, rather than rolling to the top and finding that the runway ended.  Because of the runway slope, he felt that he could not level off and pickup speed.  He pulled the nose up, and upon climbing above the crest, noticed houses at the end of the runway.

Another witness, who heard the engine but did not see the airplane in flight, stated that it sounded like it was \"overloaded and struggling.\"  Examination of the airframe revealed severe corrosion on the airframe structural tubing; however, there was no evidence of preimpact mechanical failure. Examination of the two-cylinder engine revealed that the aft cylinder, and the carburetor bowl that supplied fuel to that cylinder, were devoid of fuel, indicative of fuel starvation. Water and particulate contamination was found throughout the fuel system. Fuel sample analysis revealed that the fuel was 92 octane and contained about 9 percent ethanol. The contamination levels were sufficient to result in fuel starvation to one cylinder, and resulted in a complete loss of engine power. The complete loss of power in the rear-mounted engine at low altitude resulted in a pitch-up of the airplane, a reduction of airspeed, and an aerodynamic stall and spin from which the pilot could not recover. About 4 months prior to the accident the engine manufacturer issued guidance allowing for up to 10 percent ethanol blended fuels to be used; however, the owners were urged to confirm with the airframe manufacturer that ethanol blended fuels are allowed. No written guidance by the airframe manufacturer was located concerning the use of ethanol and no entry was located in the airplane maintenance record indicating that any change had been made to the airplane. Postmortem toxicology testing on the pilot was consistent with the use of a short-acting sleep aid the night prior to the accident and recent use of an over-the-counter antihistamine with impairing effects, likely for treatment of seasonal allergy symptoms.

The pilot powered off some electrical equipment and recycled both alternator switches. The \u201cALT\u201d annunciator lights extinguished, and all other indications returned to normal. Since nightfall was approaching and the pilot was concerned about the continued availability of electrical power, he then headed for his destination. When the airplane was on short final, the pilot noticed that none of the three green landing gear position annunciator lights were illuminated despite the fact that he had selected the landing gear down. He reported this information to the air traffic control tower controller, conducted a go-around, and asked for the controller\u2019s observations regarding the landing gear position. The pilot misunderstood the air traffic controller\u2019s communication that the landing gear was not extended. Subsequently, the pilot did not recycle the gear and did not review or execute any abnormal checklist procedures for the landing gear. Although the landing gear warning horn sounded during the second landing approach, the pilot incorrectly believed that the landing gear was extended and landed the airplane with the landing gear fully retracted. Although the landing was accomplished 31 minutes before local sunset and 58 minutes before the end of local civil twilight, the pilot did not go around again due to his concern about approaching nightfall.\u000b\u000bWhile the airplane was in temporary storage awaiting postaccident examination, the owner of the repair facility, who had previously repaired the landing gear system and had conducted the most recent annual inspection on the airplane, gained unapproved access to the airplane, operated the landing gear, and inadvertently damaged the airplane. Subsequent examination of the airplane by investigators revealed that the landing gear system operated normally, and no irregularities were revealed with the electrical system. \u000b\u000bAccording to the airplane manufacturer, without alternator augmentation, the airplane battery would have lasted about the same amount of time that it took for the flight to depart and reach the location where the pilot first noticed the electrical anomaly. Based on this information and the fact that the airplane had been tampered with, no detailed component testing was accomplished, and the root causes of the initial electrical anomaly and failure of the landing gear to extend could not be determined.

            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to review or execute any applicable checklist procedures or troubleshoot or take corrective action before landing despite indications that the landing gear was not extended. Contributing to the accident were the pilot\u2019s misunderstanding of the air traffic controller\u2019s communication that the landing gear was not extended, his desire to land quickly, and an undetermined electrical system anomaly.

Postincident examination of the airplane revealed fatigue cracking of the fuselage skin near the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer adjacent to the rupture. The fatigue cracking penetrated the fuselage skin and created an approximate 18-inch by 12-inch flap in the skin that depressurized the airplane.The fuselage skin assembly near the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer was manufactured by bonding two full aluminum sheets together, then selectively chemically milling away pockets (bays) of the inner sheet. Continuous fatigue cracks initiated from multiple origins on the inner surface of the skin adjacent to the step formed at the edge of the chemically milled area and propagated outward.Following the Southwest Airlines (SWA) flight 2294 event, on September 3, 2009, Boeing issued Service Bulletin (SB) 737-53A1301, calling for repetitive external inspections to detect cracks in the fuselage skin along the chemically milled step at stringers S-1 and S-2 right and between BS 827 and BS 847. (The hole from the SWA event was within those boundaries.) If cracks are detected, operators are to contact Boeing for repair instructions.

The airline transport pilot and three passengers were not injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by Southern Seaplane Inc. under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 with a company visual flight rules flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local area observation flight that departed at 0710 from Southern Seaplane Airport (65LA) near Belle Chasse, Louisiana.The pilot reported that the accident flight was uneventful until the airplane was maneuvering toward the intended destination (65LA) at an altitude of 500 feet above the ground. The pilot reported that the engine began running rough and he surmised that the right fuel tank was likely running low on fuel. He stated that as he changed the fuel selector position, from the right wing fuel tank to the left wing fuel tank, the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot reported that he did not utilize the electric fuel boost pump while changing fuel tanks. Due to the airplane's low altitude, the pilot performed an immediate forced landing to a nearby road; however, before landing, the airplane collided with a power line that the pilot reportedly never saw. The left wing leading edge, both wing support struts, and the aft fuselage were damaged during the forced landing. The pilot reported that he had departed with 70 gallons of fuel, evenly distributed between both wing fuel tanks. He stated that the airplane had been drawing fuel from the right fuel tank for the entire accident flight, which was 2 hours 35 minutes in duration, and that he did not switch fuel tanks until the engine began running rough.",

During the first phone call the pilot advised that the flight would be proceeding under instrument flight rules, and the briefing specialist provided convective sigmet and airmet information. During the second phone call the pilot requested an abbreviated weather briefing and the briefing specialist provided winds aloft. The pilot filed an instrument flight rules flight plan during the second phone call. After takeoff, air traffic control communications were transferred to several facilities. The flight proceeded towards the destination and while in contact with Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center, the pilot contacted briefly the Greenwood Automated Flight Service Station and advised the briefing specialist that the flight was located in the Meridian MOA but he did not provide an exact location, and questioned whether he would \"...beat that line of storms uhh that was headed eastbound.\" The pilot was advised of a severe thunderstorm watch. The briefing specialist also advised the pilot that his, \"...best bet is to probably to turn and land at meridian at this point and time I don't think [your] going to be able to beat that.\" The pilot responded, \"do that we are going to change our course and we're going to land at meridian thank you for your help.\" The pilot re-established contact with Memphis ARTCC, and requested to land at Meridian. At 1112, the controller advised the pilot that there was a large cell of heavy weather between his position and Meridian, and that better weather conditions existed near Greenwood, Mississippi. The pilot advised the controller that he would proceed to the destination airport heading 187 degrees. At 1121, the pilot requested to descend to 6,000 feet, but air traffic communications were transferred to Jackson Air Traffic Control Tower. At 1120, the pilot established contact with that facility, and he was provided the altimeter setting. Radar and radio contact were lost with that facility at 1124; the communications with the facility were not recorded. Review of NTSB plotted radar data revealed that from 1030 until the time of the accident, the airplane was proceeding in a southwesterly direction until flying near Starkville, Mississippi, at which time the airplane turned to a westerly course. The airplane continued on the westerly direction until flying near Kilmichael, Mississippi, at which time the airplane turned left and proceeded until 1121:51, on a heading of 180 degrees flying at 8,000 feet, at an average ground speed of approximately 125 knots. At that time, the airplane began a right turn to heading 220 degrees, and descended at 440 feet-per-minute. At 1123:03, the airplane began a right descending turn in excess of 6,000 feet-per-minute descent, with the last recorded radar target at 1124:03, at 1,500 feet. The last recorded radar target was located at 32 degrees 41 minutes 21 seconds North latitude, and 089 degrees 40 minutes 57 seconds West longitude. A search for the airplane was initiated, it was located the following day. A NTSB weather report indicates that better weather conditions existed in Greenwood, Mississippi, at the time the controller advised the pilot that better weather conditions existed there. Additionally, the airplane entered an area of high reflectivity (about 45 dBZ), which equates to a very strong cell. Additionally, clouds existed throughout the region. The main wreckage consisting of the fuselage was located approximately 243 degrees and .24 nautical mile from the last radar target. The airplane crashed into a heavily wooded area. Examination of the airplane revealed the left wing and both sides of the horizontal stabilator were separated from the airplane; no evidence of preexisting cracks were noted on the fracture surfaces. Examination of the flight controls and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. A review of the pilot's logbooks revealed he logged 24 hours of simulated instrument instruction after receiving his private pilot certificate. He logged 1.0 hour of actual instrument conditions; the entry did not have a signature by a certified flight instructor. He did log 4.2 hours of actual instrument flight with a flight instructor. Toxicological analysis of specimens of the pilot performed by the FAA Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory indicated tetrahydrocannabinol (.0034 ug/ml, ug/g) was detected in blood. Tetrahydrocannabinol Carboxylic Acid (.0167 ug/g, and .2324 ug/g) was detected in blood and bile respectively. Doxylamine was detected but not quantified in blood and liver.

The flight instructor reported that, when he conducted the airplane's first flight of the day, he took off with the fuel tanks completely full. The airplane was then used for another flight; the airplane was operated for a total of 2.5 hours after the most recent refueling. Based on both that time and his visual inspection of the fuel tanks, the instructor determined that there was sufficient fuel for 2 more hours of flight, and he and the student pilot then departed in the airplane for some basic airwork. About 42 minutes into the flight, while returning to the airport for landing, the engine experienced a power loss, and the instructor conducted a forced landing in a field about 8 miles from the airport. Examination of the airplane revealed that the total quantity of fuel remaining onboard was about 1.5 gallons, which was the same as the manufacturer's designated amount of unusable fuel. A small quantity of fuel was observed in the lower cowl, but this appeared to be consistent with spillage from the carburetor as a result of the accident. No other evidence of any in-flight or postimpact fuel leaks was observed. Postaccident engine examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have contributed to the power loss.Review of the airplane's calculated average fuel consumption rates for several recent flights revealed that the rates were consistent with the manufacturer's published data. However, the calculated fuel consumption rate during the flights since the last refueling was significantly higher than other recent flights and the manufacturer's data.   Despite the industry-accepted unreliability of fuel quantity indication observations, the instructor's observation of slightly less than half full tanks before the accident flight confirmed his calculations and would have resulted in 2 hours of flying time. These calculations and the instructor's observation support the validity of his preflight planning, decisions, and actions.  Although uncertainties regarding initial fuel quantity, on-site spillage, and postaccident recovered fuel quantity reduced the fidelity of that calculated value, slightly more than half of the usable fuel would have to be unaccounted for, which seems unlikely. The available evidence was insufficient to enable a determination for the reason(s) for the fuel exhaustion and subsequent engine power loss. ",

The radar data showed that during the 3 minutes prior to the last return, the airplane's groundspeed slowed from 158 knots to 70 knots while the altitude returns remained between 2,300 and 2,500 feet.  The last two radar returns show the airplane descending through 2,200 feet and 1,700 feet pressure altitudes, respectively.  The calculated ground speed during these last two radar returns was 63 knots and 42 knots, respectively.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook for the airplane lists stall speeds with 0-degree bank angle between 48.5 knots and 59 knots calibrated airspeed (CAS) depending on weight and configuration.  The gear-up, flaps-up stall speed at 2,300 pounds and 0-degree bank angle was listed at 54 knots CAS.  The gear-down, flaps 33-degree stall speed for the same weight and bank angle was listed as 48.5 knots CAS.",

The next planned fuel stop was about 741.5 nautical miles away. IFR weather conditions prevailed along the flight, but visual conditions existed at the next airport, where the pilot landed in order to obtain fuel. The pilot subsequently departed and contacted an Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) specialist to say that he was unable to refuel at that airport. He then requested a clearance to another airport, about 83.4 nautical miles away, and stated: \u201cI hope we have enough fuel.\u201d The ARTCC specialist offered a closer airport that was about 36 miles east. The pilot requested a clearance for the Localizer-Type Directional Aid (LDA) approach to the closer airport. During the initial stages of the approach, the pilot appeared to be unsure about the LDA approach procedures, and was unable to join the localizer for the approach. The ARTCC specialist asked the pilot if he wanted to try another approach, and the pilot said that he wanted to continue on to the airport that was 83.4 miles away instead. About 1 hour after the airplane had departed in search of additional fuel, and about 2 minutes before the accident, the ARTCC specialist contacted the pilot to request an estimate of his remaining fuel.

The pilot immediately performed an autorotation and run-on landing to an open parking lot area without further incident.  The helicopter was damaged with several punctures with outward deformation consistent with projectile damage originating from an uncontained engine failure. Inspection of the engine revealed that portions of the 1st-stage gas producer wheel had departed the engine.  The gas producer turbine tie bolt (part number 23068265, serial number NM81907) was identified as the primary failed component.  The tie bolt fractured immediately adjacent to the torque nut.  Further examination revealed fracture features consistent with fatigue, initiating at the thread root radius.  The microstructure, chemistry, and hardness of the turbine tie bolt met engineering drawing specifications.  No material anomalies were detected at the fracture surface.  Damage to the fracture surface precluded the determination if the failure was associated with low or high cycle fatigue.  The tie bolt had completed 3,427 cycles, about 38 percent, of its published life limit of 9,000 cycles.The failure was the first documented since the tie bolt was redesigned during the late 1990s.  The redesigned tie bolt incorporated a thicker and stiffer cross-section that had a higher resonant frequency.  The manufacturer reviewed the testing and analysis that was preformed when the tie bolt was redesigned.  Their review confirmed that the current life limit of 9,000 cycles was within design guidelines.  Additionally, the stress modeling and analysis performed during the component redesign was reviewed and no discrepancies were noted.  The manufacturer also reviewed the reengineered tie bolt service history and several tie bolts with between 5,000 and 9,000 cycles were taken out of service for examination.  Component examinations and database reviews failed to show any similar failures within the fleet.The tie bolt installation required that the bolt length be measured in order to determine the exact stretch of the bolt after the nut was torqued to specification.  The original stretch requirement was used with the redesigned tie bolt to eliminate confusion during assembly. A subsequent service bulletin and FAA airworthiness directive mandated that the older design be removed from service, but the installation stretch requirement was not modified.  To mitigate future tie bolt fractures, Rolls-Royce reduced the stretch requirement on the tie bolt during the assembly process.  As a result, the mean stress on the tie bolt was reduced.  The reduced stretch is also expected to increase both high and low cycle fatigue margins in the part.  The assembly instructions were updated with the new stretch callout during the first quarter of 2008.",

According to the flight crew stated prior to departure they were given paperwork to perform an alternate brake system test in-flight. At the top of descent they began the test. The First Officer read the procedure and the Captain performed the tasks. The Captain stated that during the test she observed brake pressures of 2,100 psi on the left and 2,500 psi on the right. She was use to observing 2,500 psi on both during this test. She performed additional testing on her own to troubleshoot the 2,100 psi reading on the left system. She then returned the system to normal and made a write-up in the aircraft's maintenance log.  The First Officer was the pilot flying and after the test they descended and approached to land at Fort Lauderdale. During the approach they performed the approach and landing checks and checked the brake system. They were using manual braking for the landing. The touchdown was proper, and the airplane immediately began to decelerate. The captain asked the First Officer if he was braking and he said no. The controller then informed them that he was rolling the equipment and when they asked why, he stated because of smoke and fire. The Captain performed the emergency evacuation checklist and the First Officer opened the aircraft door and deployed the slide. They then exited the airplane. A pilot in another airplane reported to the controller that the aircraft's tire prints at the point the airplane touched down \" looked like their brakes were locked or something.\"  Examination of the landing runway (27 Right) after the incident revealed four sets of heavy skid marks (two per bogie) that started from the initial touchdown point and were continuous to the aircraft's final resting point. There was evidence of wheel rim contact, from both the left and right main gear wheels, beginning about 500-600 feet after touchdown and continuing to the location where the aircraft came to rest. The first set of two skid marks started at about 1,200 feet from the threshold of the runway and was consistent with right main landing gear touchdown first. The total distance for the right skid was 2,383 feet. The second set of two skid marks started about 81 feet further down the runway and was consistent with a left main landing gear touchdown.  Examination of the aircraft revealed the following: all eight main landing gear tires had blown, deflated, and come apart. The damage was confined to the side of the tires that was in contact with the runway and all eight tires were worn down to the wheel assembly; there were no flat spots or other indications of damage on the opposite side of each tire. All eight wheel assemblies were symmetrically worn down about 10 percent. All eight brakes, wheel speed transducers shafts, and brake fans were damaged; there was no damage to either the left or right bogie beams. Prior to changing the tires and removing the airplane from the runway, Federal Express maintenance personnel performed a Built In Test Equipment (BITE) test on the Braking and Steering Control Unit (BSCU). The BITE test revealed 12 fault codes.  Airbus accomplished a test flight in order to reproduce the BITE fault codes that were downloaded from the incident aircraft's BSCU. The test flight was done in France on an A300-600 aircraft where the following scenario was simulated: \"Aircraft in flight, landing gear extended, parking brake set ON.

He observed a golf course and headed towards it. On approach he determined that the golfer's would be in the way so he transitioned the forced landing towards a road. On landing rollout the  left wing hit a sign. Examination of the engine assembly revealed the crankcase center web mating surface exhibited severe fretting. The crankshaft center main bearing was found displaced aft at the same location, and the bearing half's were partially rotated out of the normal position. The bearing's displaced position blocked the oil supply hole that furnishes lubrication oil to the No. 3 connecting rod and the No.3 connecting rod failed due to oil starvation.

The fire warning continued and the pilot discharged the second bottle; but the fire warning did not extinguish. The pilot performed an air turnback and landed the airplane uneventfully approximately 11 minutes later.Engine testing at the manufacturer\u2019s facility revealed a large fuel leak emanating from the No. 2 fuel nozzle manifold adapter-to-transfer tube O-ring connection.Examination revealed two manufacturing defects in the No. 2 fuel nozzle manifold adapter. The first defect, poor surface finish, caused damage to the transfer tube O-ring during the installation process, initiating an internal fuel leak. The second defect, blockage of the internal safety tell-tale drain due to an improper machining and subsequent cleaning procedure, prevented the leaking fuel from flowing into the tell-tale drain and being detected by maintenance personnel.Examination of the transfer tubes revealed an undersized O-ring retention zone, which allowed the O-ring to fit loosely such that it was not capable of withstanding continuous maximum fuel pressure load. Eventually the O-ring failed to seal properly, fuel leaked and was ignited by the hot combustor case. The undersized O-ring retention zone was created during the cleaning and overhaul process of the transfer tube.",

During simulated shutdown and feathering, the right engine was inadvertently shut down and the propeller feathered. After several unsuccessful attempts to restart the right engine, the pilot receiving instruction maneuvered the airplane to land. The airplane was on final approach about 1,000 feet above ground level (agl) and flying about 120 knots; the pilot receiving instruction lowered the landing gear, and the airplane began to slow and descend for a straight-in landing on the runway. The instructor stated that they would have a difficult time turning the airplane left onto the taxiway, so he suggested landing on a different runway, which would require a right turn onto the taxiway. The instructor then took control of the airplane and began a go-around with the landing gear still extended, despite published procedures to raise the landing gear during a go-around. However, the airplane continued to descend, and the airspeed continued to slow below the published one-engine-inoperative go-around procedure to maintain 85 knots minimum airspeed. The airplane was about 100 feet agl and slowing through 65 knots when the airplane suddenly banked to the right, which is indicative of a roll and loss of control at air minimum control airspeed (Vmca) of 65 knots.

Shortly before leaving the gate, Air Traffic Control (ATC) informed the crew that the departure runway was changed to runway 7L.  According to American Airlines, on the B737-800, only the first four runways listed on the Takeoff Performance System (TPS) can be auto-loaded if a runway change occurs after the initial upload.  Runway 7L was not one of the first four runways listed on the TPS, so the First Officer (FO) manually input the data, including the prescribed V-speeds using information on the preflight paperwork.  Flight planning data indicated that the conditions at the time of the accident called for a flaps 1 takeoff with V1 (takeoff decision speed) of 153 knots, a Vr (rotation speed) also of 153 knots, and V2 (scheduled takeoff speed) of 158 knots.  The recorded data indicates the manually entered V speeds in the FMC were V1 of 123 knots, Vr of 153 knots and V2 of 158 knots.  FMC data was not recovered, but the most likely reason for the inappropriate V1 value was determined to be a keystroke entry error by the FO when manually entering data.During the takeoff roll, the Captain reported hearing the automatic, aircraft-generated V1 callout occur, and he began to rotate the airplane.  Recorded data is consistent with rotation beginning as the airplane was passing through 123 knots, approximately 30 knots below the proper rotation speed.  The airplane pitched up to about 11 degrees just prior to liftoff at 148 knots.  The airplane operating manual specifies that tail contact will occur at 11 degrees of pitch if still on or near the ground.  The manual also states that \u201cEarly, rapid or over-rotation may result in a tailstrike.\u201d  Although there was no mention of a \"Vr\" callout, V1 and Vr are typically close in value for a 737, so the Captain may have reacted to the erroneous V1 callout, expecting that the airplane was also at Vr.  Had the Captain waited for a \u201cVr\u201d callout by the FO, the erroneous V1 entry would have had no effect.Post event examination revealed that the airplane experienced substantial damage to the lower rear fuselage.",
            "probable_cause": "the early rotation of the airplane to an angle at which the fuselage contacted the runway.  Contributing to early rotation was the Captain\u2019s reaction to the erroneous V1 automated callout, likely assuming that the airplane was at or close to the correct Vr at the same time.  The erroneous automated callout was likely due to a keystroke entry error by the FO when manually entering takeoff data for a newly assigned departure runway."

About 20 minutes into the local area flight, he recalled seeing a low cloud bank, with a base of about 1,000 feet above ground level (agl), about 1/4 mile east of the airport. At the same time, he noticed an area of heavy rain from clouds located about 15 miles west of his position. He decided to land as soon as possible due to the deteriorating weather. Instead of making an approach to the airport's single runway, he decided to land toward the west in an open pasture area that was located on the airport property. Shortly after clearing trees and hangars that were located on the east side of the airport, the weight-shift-control aircraft suddenly lost altitude, from about 20 feet agl, and impacted the ground in an upright attitude. After the impact, the aircraft rolled over onto its left side. The pilot reported that the aircraft did not appear to have any forward velocity when it impacted terrain, as indicated by a lack of damage to the surrounding vegetation. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the wing and fuselage. He stated that there were no mechanical malfunctions of the aircraft that would have precluded normal operation. Additionally, he reported that the aircraft's operating limitations included a maximum headwind and crosswind component of 21 knots and 11 knots, respectively.Meteorological data collected during the accident investigation indicated that, at the time of the accident, there was a squall line of strong-to-severe thunderstorms within a few miles of the accident site. Local weather stations indicated that there was a wind shift from the south to the north that was associated with the passage of the frontal boundary. The weather stations also reported wind gusts reaching 24 knots. A review of weather radar imagery indicated that, at the time of the pilot's preflight weather check, there was a line of thunderstorms located about 40 miles northwest of the departure airport. The same line of thunderstorms was within a few miles of the airport at the time of the accident and moved through the area almost immediately thereafter. The meteorological data suggested that the aircraft likely encountered a gust front that was associated with approaching line of thunderstorms. Although the pilot checked the weather before departure, his failure to correctly identify the location and speed of the approaching line of thunderstorms contributed to the low-level wind shear encounter shortly before touchdown.",

The airplane continued down stream and struck a pair of unmarked, parallel wires suspended approximately 50 feet above the surface of the water.  The witnesses said the sound of the engine was smooth and without interruption until the sound of the crash.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical anomalies.  Witnesses who lived along the river said the airplane made several low-level passes down the creek in the weeks preceding the accident.",

Examination of the log books revealed this was the airplane's first flight since an annual inspection had been completed. At that time, the airplane's carburetor was removed, disassembled and it's two piece venturi was replaced with a one piece venturi, per Precision Airmotive Service Bulletin # MSA-2. Also, the airplane had not been flown for over a month prior to the accident. On-scene examination of the airplane did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact failure of the airframe or engine. An engine run-up and a carburetor tear-down and flow check did not disclose any evidence of malfunction. Automotive gasoline was being used as fuel per a Supplemental Type Certificate. At an airport about 21 miles southeast of the accident site, the wind was reported to be from 200 degrees at 11 gusting 17 knots. The temperature and dew point were reported to be 34 and 23 degrees, respectively.
