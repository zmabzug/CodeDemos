The wings rocked back and forth as it drifted off the left side of the runway. Witnesses reported that the airplane appeared out of control and off center. The airplane was heading toward trees and a residence when the pilot-rated passenger, who was on board to record information during the test flight, took control of the airplane, lowered the nose, and turned away from obstructions; however, the nose abruptly dropped and the airplane struck the ground.

The airplane was equipped with a short takeoff and landing (STOL) modification.  The STOL installation droops the ailerons about 16 degrees as the flaps are extended. The pilot said he lowered the airplane flaps to 20 degrees and applied full power for a short field takeoff with the control yoke aft.  As the airplane gained speed, the pilot said the nose of the airplane rotated to about 10 degrees above the horizon, and the main landing gear tires lifted off the runway surface.  About 3 feet above the runway, the airplane suddenly rolled to the left.  The pilot applied right aileron and right rudder to stop the roll, without affect.  The left wingtip collided with small rocks along the beach about 800 feet from the beginning of the runway, and the airplane swerved about 30 degrees to the left.  The airplane came to rest on a rocky beach, about 150 degrees to the left of the runway centerline.  The pilot said the engine was producing power throughout the event.  He did not report any aileron control problem.  Postaccident photographs of the accident scene and the airplane revealed that the left wing was bent upward at the tip.  The right wing was bent upward about midspan.  A view of the aft side of the airplane revealed that the left wing flap was extended slightly.  The right wing flap was extended about one-half of its range.  The airplane was recovered by insurance and company personnel, and transported to the operator's facility.  The wings, rudder, horizontal stabilizer, and the elevator were removed for transport.  Postaccident examination of the wings by the NTSB investigator-in-charge revealed no observed mechanical malfunction of the internal flap and aileron control mechanism within each wing.  Since the wings were removed for recovery, the rigging of the aileron and flap cables could not be established.  The right front seat passenger was recording the flight on a hand-held video recorder.  Review of a copy of the video tape revealed that the airplane was taxied at a fast pace toward the departure end of the runway.  The airpane made a rolling \"U\" turn, did not slow or stop, and the pilot applied full power.  As the airplane lifed off, it almost immeditely rolled to the left and collided with the ground.  The video does not record any sound of a stall warning horn, or a view of the flap handle position.  The elapsed time from application of full power for takeoff, until the left wing collided with the ground, was about 17 seconds.  Following the accident, additional video from the passenger's camera recorded the position of the airplane at the point of rest.  The video showed that the left flap appeared to be slightly extended.  The right flap appeared extended about one-half of its normal travel.",

After the accident, the pilot checked his fueling log, and then realized that the fuel tanks had been almost completely empty prior to takeoff, and that the reason he saw no meniscus point in the fuel quantity sight gauges was because the lines were completely full of air.

Prior to departure, the pilot noted that the left fuel tank gauge indicated less than 1/4 tank and the right fuel tank gauge indicated 1/4 tank of fuel.  The pilot did not visually verify the fuel quantity in the tanks and departed using the right tank.  The pilot climbed the airplane to 5,500 feet mean seal level and set the manifold pressure and rpm at 25 inches and 2,500 rpm, respectively.  He then leaned the mixture to 30 degrees, lean of peak.  During cruise flight, the pilot felt a drop in power and noticed a fluctuating fuel flow indication and almost 1/4 tank of fuel indicated on the right gauge.  He switched to the left fuel tank, power was restored, and the fuel flow stabilized.  While approaching to land at the nearest airport, the pilot extended the gear and set the flaps to the approach setting.  Then, the engine began to lose power again and the fuel flow was fluctuating.  He applied a full rich mixture, full forward on the throttle and the propeller.

About 3 hours 20 minutes into the flight, when the airplane was about 15 miles from the intended destination airport, the pilot diverted after the airplane ahead of him performed a missed approach due to the low cloud ceiling. The pilot diverted to a nearby airport where the wind was calm and the ceiling was overcast at 400 feet above ground level (agl). The airport was equipped with a precision (instrument landing system [ILS]) approach, which the pilot did not attempt; instead, he attempted two GPS approaches to the opposite end of the runway. During both GPS approaches, the pilot performed missed approaches before the airplane reached the decision altitude of 306 feet agl. Then, about 4 hours 20 minutes into the flight, the pilot diverted again, this time to an airport that was not equipped with an ILS approach and had a reported overcast layer of clouds at 300 feet agl. He performed a GPS approach to that airport, during which he descended the airplane below the approach\u2019s published minimum descent altitude of 310 feel agl, to about 250 feet agl, before he performed a missed approach. After the missed approach, about 5 hours into the flight, the pilot advised the air traffic controller that he was low on fuel and diverted to another airport with no ILS approach to attempt a very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) approach. The pilot was in contact with air traffic control and could have declared an emergency and performed an ILS approach to a military airport that he overflew en route to the airport with the VOR approach; however, he did not. The pilot was cleared for the VOR approach about 5 hours 5 minutes into the flight and declared an emergency 6 minutes later, reporting fuel exhaustion. Air traffic control personnel provided the pilot with radar vectors to the military airport he had overflown, but the airplane impacted wooded terrain about 2 miles before it reached the runway at that airport.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to land the airplane at multiple airports that were equipped with adequate instrument approach procedures while operating in low instrument meteorological conditions and his delay in declaring a fuel-related emergency, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion."

The private pilot and passenger received minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The flight was originating at the time of the accident. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. According to the pilot, after takeoff the airplane climbed to about 100 feet above ground level (AGL) and then the \"RPM dropped\". He lowered the nose, landed on the runway but was unable to stop on the remaining runway. The airplane went down an embankment and then nosed over.A witness observed the airplane on its takeoff roll on runway 25 (5600' x 100') prior to the accident. He stated that the airplane lifted off about 2500 ft down the runway, and climbed to an altitude of about 200 ft AGL, and then \"failed to gain altitude\". He said the engine had an audible \"sputter\" and the airplane then landed back on the runway, went off the end and flipped over.A Federal Aviation Administration Inspector examined the airplane at the accident scene. The airplane came to rest inverted, with substantial damage to the left wing, empennage and vertical stabilizer. The nosewheel assembly was found separated from the strut. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit controls to the aileron, elevator and rudder, and no anomalies noted with the brakes or nose wheel steering. The engine crankshaft continuity was confirmed to the rear accessory gears. Thumb compression and suction was confirmed on all cylinders. The fuel strainer was absent of water or sediment. The left magneto produced spark on all towers when rotated by hand. The right magneto did not produce spark when rotated by hand.The 1010 weather observation at HSP included wind from 090 at 4 knots, 10 miles visibility, cloud ceiling broken at 1000 ft AGL, overcast at 4600 ft AGL, temperature 66F, dewpoint 63F, altimeter setting 30.09 inches of mercury.

Multiple witnesses near the accident site reported observing the accident airplane descending in a nose-low attitude while spinning. Witness reports, findings from the wreckage examination and recovered GPS data are consistent with the airplane entering a stall as part of the flight review and a subsequent spin. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane was equipped with dual flight controls; however, it could not be determined which pilot was manipulating the controls at the time of the accident nor could it be determined why neither pilot was able to recover from the spin.\u000b\u000bThe airplane was also equipped with a rescue ballistic parachute system. The arming handle was found fractured from the cabin roof due to a force on the handle that loaded the adhesive joint in peel mode. The arming pin was not engaged within the arming handle and exhibited a permanent bend. Fretting wear deposits were present on the retaining pin shank, suggesting that the pin was most likely engaged within the handle a significant portion of the time when the airplane was in motion. It could not be determined if the arming pin was removed before the flight or at some point during the flight. The parachute was not deployed.\u000b\u000bMedical record review revealed that the left seat pilot had significant preexisting heart disease. However, due to the limitations of the available medical evidence, the investigation could not determine if the pilot had an acute cardiac event during the flight that degraded his ability to operate the aircraft. Toxicology tests for the pilot were positive for Metoprolol, Ticlopidine, and Valsartan, which are commonly used to treat high blood pressure and angina, to control heart rate in some arrhythmias, and to reduce the risk of stroke. \u000b\u000bToxicology testing for the flight instructor, who was seated in the right seat, revealed evidence of previous marijuana use; however no active compound was detected in the postmortem blood, thus it is unlikely that he was experiencing acute impairment from marijuana at the time of the accident.",

He elected to land as soon as possible to have the problem corrected. While on short final to land, the engine lost power. Attempts to restart the engine were unsuccessful. About 400 yards from the runway, the airplane's left wing struck a tree, and the airplane crashed in a swamp. An FAA investigator interviewed the pilot and asked him when he last moved the fuel selector valve. The pilot stated that he last moved it on 'the day before the flight and [it] operated normally at that time.'  The fuel selector was 'not moved' before he departed for this flight. For this flight, he had used an 'abbreviated checklist.'

The abbreviated checklist that the pilot used did not contain item 12. Examination of the airplane's fuel selector revealed that the selector valve was stuck in the left fuel tank position due to rust from the fuel/drain spring.

Shortly after liftoff the airplane began to wobble and perform in an unstable manner, making contact again with the runway at about 2/3 of its length. The airplane then veered left off the runway, traveling through a gravel infield area in a nose-high attitude with the main landing gear still on the ground. The airplane continued through the gravel before veering back onto the runway surface just before the pavement ended and the terrain dropped away steeply at the departure end. The airplane descended into the valley and collided with downward sloping terrain. The airplane was destroyed by postimpact fire. The uphill slope of the first 2/3 of the runway made it appear much shorter than it actually was. No obvious preimpact anomalies were noted with the airframe. The engine intake valve cam lobes exhibited wear that could have resulted in a reduction of engine power, but this reduction would have occurred progressively over an extended period of time prior to the accident. It was unclear whether a reduction in engine power could have significantly affected the airplane's performance. The gross weight could not be determined with certainty; however, the airplane was loaded on the inbound trip with the same amount of passengers and baggage as the accident flight, and fueling facilities did not exist at the accident airport. The autopsy results were consistent with a cardiac event suffered by the pilot at some point around the time of the accident, but the pilot had not reported any symptoms and was actively controlling the aircraft and speaking with the surviving passenger during the accident sequence.",

One witness stated the engine noise sounded normal while two other witnesses reported a momentary sputter of engine noise, followed by a return to power. The engine noise then seemed normal for 5 to 10 seconds before the sound of impact. All three witnesses concurred that the airplane seemed lower than it should have been during the takeoff. Examination of the wreckage revealed that adequate fuel was onboard and that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane. Additionally, although the carburetor was susceptible to serious icing at glide power for the given temperature and dewpoint, the engine would have been set to full power for takeoff; thus, carburetor icing was unlikely. A teardown examination of the engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or fuel contamination.

In order to facilitate the cylinder replacement, the B-nut attaching the fuel supply hose to the engine\u2019s manifold valve was removed and reinstalled. A postmaintenance engine ground run was performed, and no discrepancies were noted.The airplane was cleared to depart from runway 36 with an easterly departure. Witnesses observed the airplane roll down the runway, liftoff, and at an estimated altitude of 300 to 500 feet above the runway, about mid-field, witnesses observed the airplane turn to the left on a west heading and descend. Witnesses heard a loss of engine power just before the turn. The airplane impacted the adjacent main road, and all three of the landing gear separated. The airplane struck a vehicle and a tree before its nose section impacted the base of a 3-foot diameter tree in the front yard of a house and then came to a stop. Postaccident propeller examination revealed that both propellers were in a low pitch position; the right propeller impacted while operating at high power, and the left was operating with low power or was windmilling at time of impact.The on-site wreckage examination found that the B-nut connecting the fuel supply hose to the manifold valve on top of the left engine had backed off about a quarter turn. The B-nut was tightened, and both engines were test run after the accident; no abnormalities that would have prevented normal operation were found. Both engines produced production-rated power. After completion of the left engine test run, the B-nut between the fuel supply hose and the manifold valve was set at finger-tight torque. A wire was attached to loosen the B-nut during the engine run, and a stop was in place to limit the rotation. The engine was started and set at full throttle and the B-nut was loosened to slightly over a quarter turn. When the B-nut was loosened, the engine immediately lost power. It is likely that the B-nut had been tightened sufficiently to maintain torque during the ground run; however, the vibration of extended engine operation during takeoff led the B-nut to back off, resulting in the loss of power in the left engine. From the position where the witnesses reported hearing the airplane lose engine power, about half the runway (or about 3,200 feet) remained. In addition, an open field was located past the departure end of that runway. However, the airplane turned left after the loss of engine power, which was contrary to the departure instructions and contrary to the safest option for an emergency landing (the remaining runway or the open field). Further, the propeller blades were in the low pitch position, indicating that the pilot didn\u2019t perform the engine failure checklist, which stated that the propeller should be feathered. Thus, it is likely that the pilot was delayed in his reaction to the sudden loss of thrust from the left engine and could not maintain airspeed or straight ahead flight.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various sources and may not have traveled in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft incident report.Crew statements and recorded flight data indicate the flight was normal from the departure from Chicago until the first officer selected gear down while on final approach to runway 4R.  There were no relevant open maintenance items on the airplane, and all applicable airworthiness directives had been complied with.  After the landing gear was selected down during approach to runway 4R, the flight crew observed a warning indicating that one or more of the main landing gear (MLG) was not down and locked and one or more gear doors were not closed. The crew executed a go-around and cycled the landing gear handle in accordance with the electronic checklist.  After cycling the landing gear, the warning remained and still indicated that one or more of the MLG was not down and locked and one or more gear doors were not closed.  The flight crew coordinated with ATC for delaying vectors and continued to follow the abnormal procedures checklists in an attempt to extend the MLG.  The United Airlines A320 Landing Gear Unsafe Indication After Extension checklist referred to the Landing Gear Gravity Extension checklist, which concluded that if the extension was unsuccessful the user was referred back to the Landing Gear Unsafe Indication After Extension.  Although the flight crew reported that the checklists were confusing, they were able to accomplish all of the specified actions on the Landing Gear - Partial Gear or Gear Up Landing checklist in an attempt to rectify the MLG problem and prepare for landing.  The first officer attempted to get assistance from United's maintenance control, but a difficulty with radio communications prevented effective assistance.  After the incident, United amended their checklists for clarity.After completing the checklist items without success, the flight crew coordinated with ATC for a partial gear-up landing on runway 4L at EWR.  During approach, the crew discussed when the engines should be shut down.  The Landing Gear - Partial Gear or Gear Up Landing checklist specified that if one MLG indicated abnormal both engines should be shut down \"at touchdown\", and if both MLG indicated abnormal the engines should be shut down \"...in the flare, before touchdown.\"  Just prior to touchdown, the Captain acknowledged the correct checklist instruction, but called for the engines to be shut down prior to touchdown.  Although not contributory to the landing gear issue, shutting down the engines, and the concurrent loss of electrical generators without the auxiliary power unit running, would result in a loss of various capabilities including nosewheel steering, anti-skid, and some spoiler capability.  The airplane's speed at this time would be too low to provide electrical power from the Ram Air Turbine as well.  Operation of the fuel cut-off switches and loss of electrical power resulted in the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder shutting down prior to touchdown.  The loss of power did not affect the cabin emergency lighting. Post incident examination of the airplane revealed that the right MLG door actuator had failed to extend the door to its fully open position.  The partially open door obstructed the right MLG from extending to its down and locked position.  The outboard tire of the right MLG was found resting on the top of the door assembly.Examination of the door actuator revealed that some of its internal components had failed, one of them producing large quantities of fragmented metallic debris that collected in one location between the piston and the cylinder with smaller particles being embedded in the piston seals.  Testing of the actuator revealed that it took more pressure than normal to initiate extension and retraction and it is considered likely that, under the right conditions, the debris might prevent the piston from moving in the cylinder.  Although the majority of the debris remained within the cylinder, smaller particles were able to migrate through the actuator's retract line, coming to rest in the retract restrictor and its mounting block.  This debris likely restricted the flow of fluid through the actuator which would reduce the speed of extension and retraction, allowing the main gear tire to contact the door and preventing further motion of the gear and door.During the evacuation, the 1R door did not fully open and only 1/8 of the 1R emergency evacuation slide dropped from the pack after the 1R door was opened.  Prior to the flight the purser said she felt resistance when she armed the 1R door.  Review of the photographs taken of the 1R slide following the incident, revealed that the 1R evacuation slide remained jammed inside its pack, and the girt was taught between the pack and the girt bar, preventing the 1R door from fully opening.  Further, no anomalies were found with the 1R power assist actuator.  According to the slide manufacturer, improper stowage of the girt bar in the floor brackets and/or improper packing of the evacuation slide can result in excessive bulk at the bottom of the slide pack and may impact the orientation of the slide pack at the initial stages of the deployment sequence.  Because no mechanical deficiencies were found with the door, slide or girt bar, the likely reason for the lack of deployment of the 1R slide was improper packing of the 1R slide.  The loss of availability of the 1R door and slide did not negatively impact the evacuation.",
            "probable_cause": "A mechanical failure of internal components of the right main landing gear door actuator resulting in the flight crew being unable to fully extend the right main landing gear using the normal and alternate procedures.Contributing to this incident was a circular reference in the company Flight Manual in which the Landing Gear Gravity Extension checklist referred back to the Landing Gear Unsafe Indication After Extension checklist rather than the Landing Gear - Partial Gear or Gear Up Landing checklist."

The flight instructor and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local instructional flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight instructor was providing an introductory flight to both of the passengers, and following an uneventful preflight inspection and run-up check of the airplane's engine, began taxiing to the departure runway. During the taxi, air traffic control offered, and the flight instructor accepted, an intersection departure from runway 23 at its intersection with runway 14. The flight instructor subsequently guided the front seated passenger through the takeoff. Shortly after rotation, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The instructor responded by placing her hand on the throttle and mixture controls, verifying that they were both pushed fully forward. The engine then resumed producing power, and the instructor then decided to return to the airport and land.As the flight instructor turned the airplane left toward runway 32, the engine again experienced a total loss of power. She attempted to restore engine power and verified the position of the throttle, mixture, and auxiliary fuel pump, but heard the aural stall warning sound. She then lowered the airplane's nose and decided to forgo troubleshooting the engine, as the airplane was close to the ground.

He stated he only observed a few drops of water during the first sample from the fuel strainer. He also stated that he performed an engine run-up before takeoff with no discrepancies noted. He applied full power to takeoff. The flight climbed to about 150 to 200 feet above ground level. When the flight was about 3/4 down the runway, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot then initiated a descent for a forced landing, and the airplane collided with trees about 1/2 mile south of the runway. Postcrash examination of the engine revealed water and debris contamination in the carburetor. The carburetor was bench tested, which revealed the fuel flow in pounds per hour to be less than the engine manufacturers limits. Review of the engine logbook revealed no entry to indicate that the carburetor had been overhauled since it was manufactured in February 1961. The FAA-PMA produced a service bulletin (non-mandatory) which stated that the carburetor must be overhauled when the engine is overhauled or 10 years, which ever is first. ",

The flight continued northbound after exiting a valley and remained at an altitude of about 100 feet above ground level (agl).  As the anticipated landing site approached, the chase crew was sent ahead to verify wind conditions.  In the descent, with the envelope cooled, the pilot planned to drift over a ridgeline oriented west to east to make use of the ridge's wind blocking effect for the landing.  About 60 feet above the trees, a west wind accelerated the balloon toward the east about 20 miles per hour.  The pilot elected to continue the attempt to land in the vicinity of the clearing he had selected, refrained from applying heat, and continued to deflate the envelope.   A downdraft was encountered, the balloon touched down hard, and bounced.  The balloon was dragged through the trees with the vent open.  The envelope softened, and then spinnakered.  With no buoyancy, the balloon descended again, faster, and was dragged through more trees, which resulted in a tree limb penetrating the basket and injuring one passenger.  The pilot and the injured passenger were dumped from the basket and the balloon came to rest a few feet away.  The other passengers remained with the gondola as it lay on its side.

Examination of the fore/aft servo revealed that the internal threads of the upper rod end fitting on the servo were severely worn. The lower threaded portion of the upper rod end was not found secured into the servo's upper end fitting and was not recovered. Additionally, the upper end fitting was packed with soil as the lower threaded portion of the upper rod end had separated from it prior to ground impact. A 100-hour maintenance inspection of the accident helicopter had been completed on the morning of the accident and a 600-hour inspection of the accident helicopter was completed about 3 months prior to the accident. Neither inspection detected the worn threads on the fore/aft servo upper end fitting. The fore/aft servo had been overhauled about 4 years prior to the accident. Additionally, the fore/aft servo was repaired 10 months prior to the accident and no anomalies were observed with the threads at that time. The operator used Mastinox, a corrosion inhibiting compound, during installation of the upper rod ends to the right-roll, left-roll, and fore/aft servos. The helicopter manufacturer's maintenance manual listed only G.355 grease and did not prescribe for the use of Mastinox. However, the standard practices manual stated that a torque correction factor of 0.4 is used for G.355 grease, but not for Mastinox, since the latter is not a lubricant. The torque value listed in the manual for the rod ends already took a torque correction factor into account. A higher torque value would theoretically have been necessary when Mastinox was used in place of G.355 grease. The operator stated an adjusted torque value was not used during installation of the upper rod ends using Mastinox. Evidence of sealant at the junction of the upper rod end and nut, which was required to be applied during servo installation per the maintenance procedures, was not found on either the right-roll or left-roll servos. While the lack of sealant may not result in a catastrophic event, its breakage or absence (and/or radial play of a servo end bearing) noted during a maintenance inspection could be indicative of a loss of torque. Review of the helicopter manufacturer's checklists and maintenance manuals revealed some guidance for servo inspections. The daily operating check (after the last flight of the day) included an instruction to check the main rotor servos for security and absence of leaks. The 600-hour inspection called for checking the radial play of the end bearings; however, there were no instructions to specifically check the threads of the servo end fitting or the torque of the rod end nut.",
            "probable_cause": "Disconnection of the upper rod end from the fore/aft servo due to severely worn threads, which resulted in a loss of control and separation of a main rotor blade during cruise flight.

The two occupants of the airplane received fatal injuries.  There were no injuries on the ground.  According to witnesses, the airplane had just departed a local, non-tower airport, and was in the initial climb phase, when it turned to the right, and then to the left, as if to return to the airport.  They saw the wings rocking from side to side, and then the airplane entered a steep, nose-down attitude.  A student pilot-witness said he saw the airplane flying low and slow overhead, and saw the airplane's nose go up, and then down, into a \"classic stall-spin.\"  A witness who spoke with the owner prior to takeoff, was told there was a problem with the fuel system, and they were going to conduct a maintenance test flight.  The owner told him the pilot/mechanic had \"blown out the fuel system\" earlier that day.  Additional witnesses said they saw the airplane taxi to the run-up area where it ran at high power for several minutes.  They said after departure everything appeared normal until the airplane started a left turn toward the airport, which they thought was unusual.

The SLC was responsible for aircraft landing and departing runway 14R and departing runway 27L and used frequencies 120.75 and 126.9.  Because of this configuration the ORD Standard Operating Procedures Order, ORD 7110.65E , required that either the Electronic Flight Strip Transfer System (EFSTS) position or Local Monitor (LMN) position be staffed to assist the SLC.  The third local controller (LC3) was responsible for aircraft departing runway 22L and used frequency 132.7.  SLC had several flightcrews who had requested to depart from runway 14R for operational purposes.  Because aircraft departing from runway 14R entered LC3's airspace, SLC was required to coordinate with LC3 for the release of those flights.  SLC verbally coordinated the release of two departure aircraft, United Airlines (UAL) flight 938 and Air India (AI) flight 124, that he intended to depart before GTI6972 landed.At 0257:00, the SLC controller instructed UAL938 to taxi into position to hold on runway 14R.  The crew acknowledged. At 0257:28, the flight crew of GTI6972 made initial contact with the ORD SLC and said, \"hello tower, Giant 6972 heavy 9 D-M-E  I-L-S one four right.  The tower controller replied, \"\u2026O'Hare tower, runway 14 right cleared to land.  [Wind] one six zero at eight, traffic will depart ahead of your arrival.\"  The flight crew read back the landing clearance.  At 0257:50, the SLC cleared UAL938 for takeoff.At 0258:10, the SLC instructed UAL1015, \"Traffic lands, departs, crossing, runway 27 left position and hold.  The crew replied, \"need about two minutes, UAL1015 if you could delay us in position that's fine.\"  The SLC said, \"UAL1015, let me know when you're ready, hold in position runway 27L.\"  The crew acknowledged.According to the SLC's interview, he stated that at this time he determined there was not enough spacing to permit AI124 to depart from runway 14R prior to GTI6972's arrival.  He walked to the LC3 controller and advised that he would not be departing the second airplane and would re-coordinate a release at a later time.At 0259:19, the SLC instructed UAL938 to contact departure control, which the crew acknowledged.At 0300:20, the crew of UAL1015 advised, \"tower, United 1015, we're ready 27L.\"  In his interview, the SLC said, \"As this was happening, I looked to see what was on the third local controller's board to effectively coordinate the remaining departures from runway 14R.  GTI6972 was the last arrival that was on the D-BRITE  display so it allowed for a great deal of flexibility.  Because of this flexibility, rather than cut off the [runway] 22L departures, I looked at his board to see what the best time to release his flights would be.  I then saw an American B777 moving up as the third departure aircraft [from runway 14R].  As I was determining the traffic flow, UAL1015 called 'ready'.  I checked the [runway] 14R final out the window and there was nothing there.  I scanned [runway] 27L from the departure end to the aircraft and there was nothing there.  I checked the D-BRITE.

Based on recall and hindsight, all this happened in about 3 or 4 seconds.\"  At 0300:22, the SLC said, \"United 1015, thank you, fly runway heading runway 27 left cleared for takeoff, wind one five zero at seven.\"  The crew responded, \"runway heading, cleared for takeoff United 1015.\"During the EFSTS' interview, he said he looked up and saw GTI6972 on landing roll on runway 14R at slow speed approaching taxiway T10.  Although he was required to monitor the SLC frequencies, he did not and did not hear any communications between the SLC and any flight crews.  He said he assumed GTI6972 was turning off at taxiway T10, because \"it is very common\".  He looked left and saw out of the corner of his eye UAL1015 departing runway 27L.  He looked back to GTI6972 and thought he might turn off on the next taxiway, M, to go to the NE cargo area then decided he was not.  He then alerted the SLC.At 0301:12, the SLC said, \"stop, stop, stop.\"According to the United 1015 Captain's written statement, \"The takeoff was completely normal until approximately 110 knots, when I noticed [GTI6972] approaching our runway on what appeared to be [runway] 14R or taxiway T.  I commented that it didn't look like he was going to stop. I would estimate [GTI6972] was traveling 15-20 knots.  At that point, I did not feel that we would be able to abort and stop prior to those intersections (around 110-120 knots), so I decided to continue accelerating towards [GTI6972] and if needed, attempt to rotate over him.  The other option was an abort and a right steer behind [GTI6972] to the north of runway 27L.  Knowing there are substantial obstacles right of [runway] 27L, I felt that option would guarantee significant airframe damage and probably passenger injury.  [GTI6972] continued encroaching on our runway, and it became clear that I would have to rotate early to clear it.  By the time I rotated, [GTI6972] was fully on our runway.  Vr  at our weight was 143 knots, and I estimate I began the rotation 10 knots prior to Vr. The First Officer called V1  shortly after I started rotating.  I flew a smooth rotation until we were airborne for fear of dragging the tail and delaying further rotation.\"Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS)  did not activate. (See section 2.)  Data recorded by the AMASS indicates that UAL1015 flew over GTI6972.",

The pilot aborted the landing, and flew to another airport where the airplane landed without the left main landing gear. The horizontal stabilizer was damaged during the initial landing attempt when the left landing gear separated, and struck the horizontal stabilizer. Metallurgical examination of the landing gear showed an altered micro structural layer adjacent to the surface, indicative of excessive thermal input such as welding. The strut portion showed that most of the exterior surface contained an intact layer of white paint. In many locations throughout the strut, the paint appeared to have been applied to an irregular or pitted surface.",
            "probable_cause": "The misjudged landing flare by the pilot, and the inadequate landing gear inspection/repair procedure used by other maintenance personnel, resulting in the failure of the main landing gear strut during landing."

He did not observe any portion of the accident flight and was uncertain of the exact time of the accident. A postaccident examination of the aircraft did not reveal any anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure or malfunction.\u000b\u000bThe pilot of the accident aircraft did not hold any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) pilot, mechanic, or repairman certificates, nor had he ever applied for or been issued an FAA medical certificate. An acquaintance of the pilot, who had also flown the aircraft, noted that the weight-shift-control trike was more difficult to fly than he had expected. He reportedly told the pilot that he should not fly the aircraft. He also noted that the pilot had not received any flight training in the make/model of the accident aircraft; however, the pilot reportedly informed him that he was planning to obtain flight instruction. The investigation obtained no record of the pilot\u2019s flight experience or of the aircraft\u2019s maintenance history.\u000b\u000bThe pilot exhibited localized scarring of the heart muscle that was likely not recent based on the absence of inflammation; the enlarged heart was consistent with chronic high blood pressure.\u00a0The effect that either of these conditions might have had on the pilot during the accident flight, if any, could not be determined. The extent of coronary artery disease was mild and likely not an issue in the accident. Cyclobenzaprine, which was present in the operator\u2019s blood and is commonly used to treat muscle spasms, can cause sedation; however, accident risk with chronic use of the medication has not been well studied. As a result, the investigation could not determine whether this medication was impairing at the time of the accident. Metoprolol, detected in the pilot\u2019s blood and commonly used to treat high blood pressure, angina, or heart arrhythmias, rarely produces significant cognitive impairment and was likely not a factor in the accident.

The commercial pilot was not injured. The airplane was registered to Airspeed Enterprises LLC and operated by Drag 'N' Fly Banners, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local banner-tow flight that departed Platte Valley Airpark (18V), Hudson, Colorado, about 1500.The pilot reported that the purpose of the banner-tow flight was to orbit Coors Field, located downtown Denver, Colorado, with a commercial advertisement billboard that measured 27 feet by 50 feet. He stated that there were no anomalies identified during his preflight inspection of the airplane and that he held a briefing with his ground support team before departing on runway 15. He entered the traffic pattern for runway 9 and retrieved the banner at 1505. After retrieving the banner, the flight proceeded west from 18V, staying below the Class B airspace, toward I-25 where he turned southbound toward downtown Denver and Coors Field. The pilot stated that while en route the airplane was not performing as expected, with little to no climb performance, but the engine was operating without any anomalies. He reported that the airplane was at 6,100 feet mean sea level, about 700 feet above the ground, when he decided to return to his departure point by making a right 180-degree turn toward north. However, before completing the turn he released the banner because of an excessive descent rate. The pilot reported that the airplane accelerated slightly after he released the banner, but it was still operating near an aerodynamic stall, and about 10-15 seconds after he released the banner, the airplane entered a stall/spin at a low altitude. The pilot stated that the airplane descended, inverted, into a residential area and collided with a house. The pilot reported that following the accident he released his restraints and exited the airplane uninjured. A postaccident fire ensued that destroyed the airplane and significantly damaged the house. There were no reports of any ground injuries.Numerous witnesses reported seeing the airplane flying at a low altitude before it dropped its banner and descended into a residential area. One witness reported that the airplane was flying at a slow groundspeed in a nose-up flight attitude before it descended into the residential area. Several witnesses remarked that the towed-banner nearly came in contact with the power-lines as the airplane crossed over Huron Street.At 1536, the automated surface observing system (ASOS) located at Erie Municipal Airport (EIK), about 8 miles from the accident site, reported: wind from 170 degrees at 10 knots, gusting 20 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear sky, temperature 27 degrees Celsius, dew point -10 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 29.78 inches of mercury.",

The helicopter was involved in a hard landing in 2004 after which the main rotor blades and tail rotor assembly including the spindle and blades were replaced.  According to the pilot's friend, they balanced the new tail rotor blades after they were installed, but the blades continued to run \"rough.\"  The pilot voiced these concerns to the manufacturer and the manufacturer sent replacement tail rotor blades to the pilot.  According to the manufacturer and the pilot's friend, the helicopter was running fine after the replacement blades were installed.  Examination of the wreckage revealed all major components of the helicopter were located at the main wreckage site except for one of the tail rotor blades and the respective outboard 2 inches of the tail rotor spindle which were not located.  The tail rotor spindle contained two integral rods, which extended out in opposite directions.   The length of each rod was manufactured with sections of consecutively reduced diameter.  A metallurgical examination of the spindle revealed a fatigue failure was present, which initiated at the fillet radius between the sections where the rod steps down from 0.812-inch diameter to 0.750-inch diameter.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot began flying the twin piston-engine airplane model for the cargo airline about 11 months before the accident. Although he had since upgraded to one of the airline\u2019s twin-turboprop airplane models, due to the airline\u2019s logistical needs, the pilot was transferred back to the piston-engine model about 1 week before the accident.The flight originated at one of the airline\u2019s outlying destination airports and was planned to stop at an interim destination to the southwest before continuing to the airline\u2019s base as the final destination. The late afternoon departure meant that the flight would arrive at the interim destination about 10 minutes after sunset. That interim destination was situated in a sparsely populated geographic bowl just south of terrain that was significantly higher, and the ceilings there included multiple broken and overcast cloud layers near, or lower than, the surrounding terrain.\u000b\u000bAlthough not required by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, the airline employed dedicated personnel who performed partial dispatch-like activities, such as providing relevant flight information, including weather, to the pilots. Before takeoff on the accident flight, the pilot conferred briefly with the dispatch personnel by telephone, and, with little discussion, they agreed that the flight would proceed under visual flight rules to the interim destination. Information available at the time indicated that the cloud cover almost certainly precluded access to the airport without an instrument approach; however, the airplane was not equipped to conduct the only available instrument approach procedure for that airport. Additionally, the pilot did not have in-flight access to any GPS or terrain mapping/database information to readily assist him in either locating the airport or remaining safely clear of the local terrain. \u000b\u000bAlthough the airplane was not being actively tracked or assisted by air traffic control (ATC) early in the flight, review of ground tracking radar data showed that the flight initially headed directly toward the interim destination but then began a series of turns, descents, and climbs. The airplane then disappeared from radar as the result of radar coverage floor limitations due to high terrain and radar antenna siting. The airplane reappeared on radar about 24 minutes after it disappeared and about 9 minutes after the FAA-defined beginning of night. Based on the flight track, it is likely that the pilot made a dedicated effort to access the airport, while concurrently remaining clear of the clouds and terrain, strictly by visual means. This task was made considerably more difficult and hazardous by attempting it in dusk conditions, and then darkness, instead of during daylight hours.\u000b\u000bAbout 15 minutes after the airplane reappeared on radar, when it was at an altitude of about 13,500 ft, the pilot contacted ATC and requested and was granted an instrument flight rules clearance to his final destination. About 3 minutes later, the controller cleared the flight to descend to 10,000 ft, and the airplane leveled off at that altitude about 6 minutes later. However, upon reaching 10,000 ft, the pilot requested a lower altitude to escape \u201cheavy\u201d up- and down-drafts, but the controller was unable to comply because the ATC minimum vectoring altitude was 9,700 ft in that region. About 1 minute later, radar contact was lost. Shortly thereafter, the airplane impacted terrain in a steep nose-down attitude in a near-vertical trajectory. Although examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact mechanical deficiencies that would have prevented normal operation and continued flight, the extent of the damage precluded, except on a macro scale, any determination of the preimpact integrity or functionality of any systems, subsystems, or components, including the ice protection systems, autopilot, and nose baggage door.\u000b\u000bAnalysis of the radar data indicated that the airplane was above 10,000 ft for at least 41 minutes (possibly in two discontinuous periods) and above 12,000 ft (in two discontinuous periods) for at least 18 minutes. Although the airplane was reportedly equipped with supplemental oxygen, the investigation was unable to verify either its presence or its use by the pilot. Lack of supplemental oxygen at those altitudes for those periods could have contributed to a decrease in the pilot\u2019s mental acuity and his ability to safely conduct the flight. Analysis of air mass data revealed that mountain-wave activity and up- and downdrafts with vertical velocities of about 1,000 ft per minute (fpm) were present near the accident site and that the largest and most rapid transitions from up- to down-drafts occurred near the accident site, which was also supported by the airplane\u2019s altitude data trace. The analysis also indicated that the last radar target from the airplane was located in a downdraft with a velocity of between 600 and 1,000 fpm. Other meteorological analysis indicated that the airplane encountered icing conditions, likely in the form of supercooled large droplets (SLD), several minutes before the accident. Aside from pilot reports from aircraft actually encountering SLD, no tools currently exist to detect airborne SLD. Further, the tools and processes to reliably forecast SLD do not exist. SLD is often associated with rapid ice accumulation, especially on portions of the airplane that are not served by ice protection systems. Airframe icing, whether due to accumulation rates or locations that exceed the airplane\u2019s deicing system capabilities, mechanical failure, or the pilot\u2019s failure to properly use the system, can impose significant adverse effects on airplane controllability and its ability to remain airborne.\u000b\u000bBecause of the pilot\u2019s recent transition from the Beechcraft BE-99, in which the pitot heat was always operating during flight, he may have forgotten that the accident airplane\u2019s pitot heat procedures were different and that the pitot heat had to be manually activated when the airplane encountered the icing conditions. If the pitot heat is not operating in icing conditions, the airspeed information becomes unreliable and likely erroneous. Erroneous airspeed indications, particularly in night instrument meteorological conditions when the pilot has no outside references, could result in a loss of control. The investigation was unable to determine whether the pitot heat was operating during the final portion of the flight.\u000b\u000bThe investigation was unable to determine whether the pilot used the autopilot during the last portion of the flight. If he was using the autopilot, it is possible that, at some point, he was forced to revert to flying the airplane manually due to the unit\u2019s inability and to a corresponding Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook prohibition against using it to maintain altitude in the strong up- and downdrafts, which would increase the pilot\u2019s workload. Another possibility is that the autopilot was unable to maintain altitude, and, instead of disconnecting it, the pilot overpowered it via the control wheel. If that occurred and the pilot overrode the autopilot for more than 3 seconds, the pitch autotrim system would have activated in the direction opposite the pilot\u2019s input, and, when the pilot released the control wheel, the airplane could have been significantly out of trim, which could result in uncommanded pitch, altitude, and speed excursions and possible loss of control.\u000b\u000bWhether the pilot was hand-flying the airplane or was using the autopilot, the encounter with the strong up- and downdrafts and consequent altitude loss likely prompted the pilot to input corrective actions to regain the lost altitude, specifically increasing pitch and possibly power. Such corrections typically result in airspeed losses; those losses can sometimes be significant as a function of downdraft strength and the airplane\u2019s climb capability. If that capability is compromised by the added weight, drag, and other adverse aerodynamic effects of ice, aerodynamic stall and a loss of control could result.\u000b\u000bRadar tracking data and ATC communications revealed that another, similar-model airplane flew a very similar track about 6 minutes behind the accident airplane, except that that other airplane was at 12,000 ft not 10,000 ft. The 10,000-ft ATC-mandated altitude placed the accident airplane closer to the underlying high terrain and into the clouds with the icing conditions and the strong vertical air movements. In contrast, the pilot of the second airplane reported that he was in and out of the cloud tops and did not report any weather-induced difficulties.\u000b\u000bThe accident pilot did not have any efficient in-flight means for accurately determining the airborne meteorological conditions ahead, and the ATC controller did not advise him of any adverse conditions. Therefore, the pilot did not have any objective or immediate reason to refuse the ATC-assigned altitude of 10,000 ft. Ideally, based on both the AIRMET and the ambient temperatures, the pilot should have been aware of the likelihood of icing once he descended into clouds. That, particularly combined with his previously expressed lack of confidence in the airplane\u2019s capability in icing conditions, could have prompted him to request either an interim stepdown altitude of 12,000 ft or an outright delay in a direct descent to 10,000 ft, but, for undetermined reasons, the pilot did not make any such request of ATC.\u000b\u000bBased on the available evidence, if the ATC controller had not descended the airplane to 10,000 ft when he did, either by delaying or by assigning an interim altitude of 12,000 ft, it is likely that the airplane would not have encountered the icing conditions and the strong up- and downdrafts. In addition, if the presence of SLD and/or strong up- and downdrafts had been known or explicitly forecast and then communicated to the pilot either via his weather briefing, his onboard equipment, or by ATC, it is likely that the pilot would have opted to avoid those phenomena to the maximum extent possible. The flight\u2019s encounter with airframe icing and strong up-and downdrafts placed the pilot and airplane in an environment that either exacerbated or directly caused a situation that resulted in the loss of airplane control.",
            "probable_cause": "The airplane\u2019s inadvertent encounter, in night instrument meteorological conditions, with unforecast strong up- and downdrafts and possibly severe airframe icing conditions (which likely included supercooled large droplets that the airplane was not certificated to fly in) that led to the pilot's loss of airplane control.

A witness, about 1 mile south of the accident site, estimated that the helicopter was about 1,000 feet above the ground as it passed over him.  Shortly afterwards, he heard a \"pop\", and the helicopter started a shallow, controlled turn to the left, followed by two or three more popping sounds.  The helicopter then began to descend rapidly, and started spinning counter-clockwise.  As the helicopter's descent rate increased, the main rotor blades stopped turning, and the helicopter entered a vertical descent.  The witness said he could no longer hear any engine sounds during the accident helicopter's vertical descent.  The helicopter crashed in a residential area, and came to rest between two houses.  The helicopter sustained damage consistent with a high speed, fuselage level, vertical impact.  Postaccident inspection of the engine core and airframe disclosed no evidence of any preimpact anomalies.  Impact damage prevented testing of the engine's carburetor and ignition wiring harness assemblies.  A review of the accident pilot's historical training records revealed a series of failed check rides and overall substandard performance.  The NTSB IIC interviewed both previous and prospective employers, which disclosed that the accident pilot had either been dismissed or not hired due to his lack of academic and/or flight skills.  The FAA approved flight manual for the accident helicopter, emergency procedures section, states that at the first indication of an engine failure, the pilot's required emergency action is, in part:  1) Lower collective immediately to maintain rotor rpm, and enter a normal autorotation.  2) Establish a steady glide at approximately 65 knots.  The helicopter manufacturer published a safety notice, which addressed the dangers of a low rotor rpm conditions, stating in part: \"A primary cause of fatal accidents in light helicopters is the [pilots] failure to maintain rotor rpm.  To avoid this, every pilot must have his reflexes conditioned so he will instantly add throttle and lower the collective to maintain rpm in any emergency.\"  Additionally, the safety notice states, in part: \"If the pilot not only fails to lower the collective, but instead pulls up on the collective to keep the ship [helicopter] from going down, the rotor will stall almost immediately.  When it stalls, the blades will either \"blow back\" and cut off the tail cone or it will just stop flying, allowing the helicopter to fall at an extreme rate.  In either case, the resulting crash is likely to be fatal.  No matter what causes the low rotor rpm, the pilot must first roll on the throttle and lower the collective simultaneously to recover rpm BEFORE investigating the problem.  It must be a conditioned reflex.  In forward flight, applying aft cyclic to bleed off airspeed will also help recover lost [rotor] rpm.\" ",

At the same time, the aircraft drifted toward the side of the 60-foot wide runway, and this resulted in the pilot having to turn twice in order to avoid trees growing near the side of the runway. During the second turn, the pilot failed to maintain an airspeed above stall speed, and therefore the aircraft stalled, rolled to the left, and descended into the house. No evidence of any problem with the engine or flight controls were found during the post-accident inspection of the aircraft, and the pilot stated that he felt the engine was running fine, and that there did not seem to be any problems with the flight controls.  ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain an airspeed above stall speed (Vs) while turning to avoid trees along the side of the runway during the initial climbout after takeoff. Factors include, a variable wind that became a tailwind, and trees growing near the side of the runway."

The flight was subsequently diverted  to Memphis for a precautionary landing.  Post-landing examination of the engine revealed a 4-inch long (circumferential) by 1-inch wide (axial) burn-through in the low pressure turbine case in the plane of the 2nd stage turbine stators at the 11 o'clock location. The examination of the fuel pump filter revealed the presence of a bronze-colored material.  The fuel nozzles were reported to have bronze-colored material in the nozzle jets.  Records show that the fuel pump had operated 17,208 hours time since new and 6,972 cycles since new.  The disassembly of the pump revealed the pump housing had gear pocket milling.  The fixed and driven bearings, which are made of bronze, were worn.  The fuel pump's filter bypass valve was found to have bronze-colored particles on both sides of the valve.  The fuel pump's four bearings were made of bronze and all four bearings exhibited wear and material loss. ",
            "probable_cause": "the inadequate (bronze) material used by the fuel pump's manufacturer, which wore and ultimately blocked the fuel filter bypass and partially blocked the fuel nozzles, causing the fuel spray to burn through the low pressure turbine case. "
