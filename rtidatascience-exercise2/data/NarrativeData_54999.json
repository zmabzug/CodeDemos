The pilot returned to the airport and radioed the mechanic regarding the loud sound.  When the pilot brought the airplane to a stop, the sound diminished.  With engines idling, the mechanic opened the door of the airplane to troubleshoot the malfunction.  Cabin pressure existed when the mechanic attempted to open the entry door and the door \"blew\" outward.  The door struck the mechanic's head. An examination of the airframe revealed that a vacuum line had separated from the vacuum controller at a T-fitting.  The T-fitting was located in the area that the mechanic had worked in during installation of the vertical speed indicator.  The disconnected line disabled the entire vacuum system and subsequently disabled the airplane's pressurization system outflow valve.  Prior to the mechanic opening the door, the pilot reported turning the environmental controls off which stopped the in-flow of cabin pressure.  However, because the vacuum system could not drive the safety valve open, the airplane remained pressurized. An examination of the door assembly and differential-pressure-sensitive diaphragm revealed no anomalies.  Testing results conducted on the diaphragm were consistent with a new diaphragm.  The door system met the certification requirements of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 23.

About 40 minutes into the sixth leg of the trip, the airplane\u2019s engine lost all power, and the pilot made a forced landing to a tree-covered field, sustaining substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. A review of the pilot\u2019s fueling receipts, along with the flight times on each of the legs, revealed that the engine was consuming an average of 14.6 gallons per hour (gph) of fuel during the first four legs of the trip. On the next leg, the fuel consumption rose to an average of 17.13 gph. The airplane had flown a total time of 3:10:48, from the time the pilot last refueled. According to the airplane manufacturers cruise and range performance charts, if flown in accordance with the notes on the chart, the airplane should have had enough fuel to fly between four and five hours.

Both pilots flew the airplanes in a rectangular pattern until they reached the jump altitude of 12,700 ft mean sea level. The 182 pilot established a jump heading and visually confirmed that the 185 was to the left side and aft of the 182. The 182 pilot then called out \"door open\" and jumpers \"climbing out.\" Subsequently, the four skydivers on board the 182 climbed out onto the airplane's right wing strut and right wheel step. Almost immediately, the 182 was struck by the 185. The 182's windshield was shattered, and the airplane entered an uncontrollable descent. During the descent, the right wing separated from the airplane, and the right wing fuel tank exploded. The 182 pilot exited the airplane and parachuted safely to the ground. The 185 pilot reported that \"when it was time for the skydivers to climb out, the two planes began to drift together and in seemingly no time at all, the two were colliding.\" After the collision, the skydivers on board the 185 jumped from the airplane as it inverted; the pilot was able to recover the airplane and land. During postaccident interviews, the pilots of both airplanes and the operator's chief pilot reported that, before the flight, they briefed that the trail airplane would be positioned on the left side of the lead airplane. However, each of the three pilots differently described the expected lateral and vertical separation between the trail airplane and the lead airplane. The 182 pilot described the trail position as 20 to 30 ft aft of the lead airplane on a 45-degree bearing and lower than the lead airplane. The 185 pilot described the trail position as one to two airplane lengths (about 26 to 52 ft) aft and left of the lead airplane and at the same altitude as the lead airplane. The chief pilot described the trail position as three airplane lengths (about 78 ft) aft and left of the lead airplane and slightly lower than the lead airplane. Even though none of the pilots stated that the trail airplane should be flown higher than the lead airplane, a video taken of the flight showed that the trail airplane pilot flew the trail airplane higher than the lead airplane until impact.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not provide any guidance to pilots on how to fly skydiving formation flights nor does it require skydiving operators to provide skydiving pilot training or skydiving formation pilot training. The skydiving operator did not provide its pilots skydiving formation flight training, and it did not keep records of pilot training nor was it required to do so by the FAA. The United States Parachute Association published an article titled, \"Formation Flying 101: A Guide for Jump Pilots\" that provided guidelines for skydiving formation flights, including, in part, that the trail airplane should be within 100 ft of the lead airplane; however, it did not specify that the trail airplane should be lower than the lead airplane. The article did state that altitude separation is the No. 1 way to avoid a collision and that the trail airplane pilot has only one thing to do\u2013hold position relative to the lead aircraft and never lose sight of it. It is essential that pilots flying skydiving operation formation flights have adequate training to conduct the flights properly and ensure the safety of their passengers. If both pilots had received adequate skydiving formation flight training, they might have had a consensus about how the formation flight should have been flown. If the trail airplane pilot had received such training, he might have been more vigilant about maintaining adequate lateral and vertical separation from the lead airplane during the flight.     ",

The arrival airport was surrounded by water on three sides, and at the time of the accident, the moon was below the horizon.  Examination of radar data revealed that the airplane followed the southeasterly procedure track for the intermediate segment of a published localizer approach.  The airplane flew through the localizer 190-degree final approach course, and did not change its heading to intercept the course for another 30 seconds.  Once established on the localizer course, the airplane performed S-turns back and forth across the course throughout the approach.  The airplane crossed on the east side of the final approach fix at 1,200 feet, 300 feet below the minimum altitude for the intermediate segment of the approach, and then began a constant descent of about 850 feet per minute.  For the next two miles, the airplane turned gradually to the southwest, and crossed the localizer centerline at 100 feet, shortly before radar contact was lost.  The minimum descent altitude for the final segment was 340 feet.  The airplane crashed two miles prior to the runway of intended landing, which was equipped with pilot-controlled precision approach path indicator lighting.

At the destination airport, weather was reported as 3 statute miles of visibility and mist, and an overcast cloud layer at 700 feet.  The overcast ceiling was variable from 400 to 1,100 feet agl.  The flight progressed without incident, and once in the vicinity of the destination airport, the pilot requested and was subsequently cleared for the GPS approach.  No further transmissions were received from the pilot.  The airplane struck trees, and came to rest in a wooded area, about 1-3/4 miles from the runway 32 threshold, and about 1/2-mile right of the extended centerline.  A postcrash fire consumed the main wreckage.  The elevation of the accident site was 563 feet msl.  Review of the approach plate for the GPS approach revealed that the inbound course from the final approach fix, located about 5 miles prior to the airport, was 324 degrees.  The minimums for the straight in approach to runway 32 were 1 statute mile of visibility, and a minimum decision altitude of 960 feet msl (624 feet agl).  No procedure turn was required for the approach.  Review of radar data revealed that after the airplane crossed the final approach fix, it turned right, away from the final approach course, and began tracking northbound for several seconds.  The airplane then made a left turn and proceeded inbound towards the airport and tracked an approximate 300-degree course until the last radar return was received, where the airplane was about 1 mile southeast of the airport at 1,000 feet msl.  The pilot had accumulated about 409 hours of total flight experience.

The airline transport certificated pilot and airline transport certificated copilot were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR flight plan had been filed for the public use flight contracted by the United States Navy that departed PHF around 1123.According to the flight crew, prior to departure at PHF, they preflighted the airplane and found everything to be normal including the nose gear strut and oleo gear extensions. On this flight the copilot was flying from the left seat and the pilot was flying from the right seat. They taxied to runway 25 and took off at approximately 1115 without incident.The flight crew started running the after takeoff checklist and at \"Positive Rate\", the pilot moved the landing gear selector handle to the up position, and when he did, they felt and heard a loud \"Clank\" come from the nose of the airplane.  They also observed that the red unsafe nose gear light had illuminated. The flight crew then recycled the landing gear handle with the same result.The flight crew then elected to return to PHF because of the nose gear issue. They jettisoned fuel to get below maximum landing weight and then returned to the airport for landing. The pilot asked the air traffic controller in the control tower for permission to do a low approach to runway 20, and to visually inspect their nosewheel to make sure it was not in any other position than \"straight.\" The flight crew then selected the landing gear handle to the down position and received three green landing gear down indications (everything normal) and then completed the before landing checklist.The flight crew then executed a low approach for runway 20 and the air traffic controller advised that the nose landing gear appeared to be straight. The flight crew then kept the airplane in the landing configuration and entered a left downwind for runway 25.During the landing, they touched down main wheels first, and held the nose off for as long as possible. Once the nose wheel touched down and weight was on the nose landing gear, the airplane suddenly turned sharply, 30 to 40 degrees to the left. Both flight crewmembers then applied right rudder to counter the turn without effect. The airplane then struck a concrete runway edge light base, turned about 180 degrees from its original direction of travel, and then came to rest on the left side of the runway.The pilot then instructed the copilot to open the main door to egress but the copilot was unable to get the door to open, so he removed the emergency exit on the right side of the airplane. The pilot then completed the emergency evacuation procedures and egressed from the airplane after the copilot had egressed.Examination of the airplane revealed that it was substantially damaged. The nose landing gear assembly, nose wheel steering servo, and nose wheel steering computer, were retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

The passenger and pilot together had previously made delivery flights from the Robinson factory to Canada.  Two witnesses saw the helicopter just before it impacted the ground and reported that the tail boom had separated from the fuselage.  No witnesses were identified who saw the initial breakup sequence.  Both main rotor blades were bent downward at significant angles, with one blade having penetrated the cabin on the right side with a downward slicing front to rear arc.

The airplane was on a  cross-country flight across northern Arizona and was receiving VFR flight advisories from Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC).  While en route near Flagstaff at 11,500 feet mean sea level (msl), the pilot advised the controller that he was unable to maintain visual flight due to clouds, rain, and ice, and requested an IFR clearance into Flagstaff.  Review of the recorded air-to-ground communications tapes disclosed that the transmission from the airplane was scratchy and of poor quality.  The investigation later determined that on the morning of the accident, an underground fiber optic communication line was cut, which disrupted the quality of air-to-ground and ground-to-air communications in northern Arizona, causing broken and garbled services.  Landline communications were also affected, which required a nearby Flight Service Station to relay land line messages between the tower and the ARTCC.  The controller advised the pilot of rime ice reports at 13,000 feet on his course, and the pilot responded that his altitude was 12,000 feet and he was accumulating some ice.  The controller advised the pilot of the airport's location.  The pilot's reply was broken and unreadable.  The controller asked the pilot if he had the airport in sight, and the pilot responded that no he was in some clouds.  The pilot then requested to go to the tower frequency and land, and the controller issued a VFR transponder code and handed the flight off to the tower.

An inspection of the cargo door installation on the accident aircraft revealed the door structure and locking mechanism were intact and appeared undamaged.  The door closed and latched properly.  The cargo door had a window installed.  The inspection noted that with this design the door had enough flexibility to allow the forward frame of the door to be seated in the door jamb and latched, while the aft frame was outside the jamb and unlatched.  The micro-switch for the DOOR WARNING annunciator light was located on the forward jamb.  Therefore, it was possible in that configuration for the aft cargo door latch not to be engaged without the annunciator light being illuminated.",

The pilot and two medical crewmembers were en route to pick up a patient on a barrier island. The pilot flew over the water with the autopilot engaged (altitude acquisition mode), at an altitude of 1,000 feet. While en route, the pilot unsuccessfully attempted to contact the fire department on the island to obtain landing zone information. When the helicopter was approximately 3 minutes from landing, the pilot selected 500 feet using the autopilot and the helicopter initiated a descent to that altitude. Unable to contact the fire department, the pilot likely became preoccupied with the task as well as the visual acquisition of the landing. The descent-power setting, which was manually controlled by the pilot, was not adequate to capture the selected altitude, and maintain 60 knots. As designed, the helicopter likely continued its descent with the autopilot engaged until it impacted the water. The pilot observed an amber indication on the primary flight display just before impact, which indicated the autopilot was engaged, and confirmed this most likely scenario. A post-accident examination of the helicopter revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies. After the impact, the dispatcher initiated a re-boot of her computer, rather than a search for the helicopter, when the helicopter's movement stopped on her screen. However, the fire department on scene initiated a search, and the crewmembers were rescued within a short timeframe.

About 55 miles from the departure airport, he reported an autopilot/runaway trim problem to an air traffic controller.  During the return to his departure airport, the pilot told the controller, that he was pulling circuit breakers, and that he did not need any assistance.  Additionally, the pilot reported that this problem had been an intermittent problem in the past.   Review of radar data revealed the airplane's normal departure and 180-degree turn back to its departure airport.  The radar data also revealed that the airplane's departure track as a straight-line, with little deviation in altitude or airspeed.  When the airplane returned to its departure airport, it descended to an altitude of 2,200 feet mean sea level (msl), and proceeded northwest, just beyond the airport.

She was also taking gabapentin (an anti-seizure medication, also used to treat chronic pain), and fFluconazole (a prescription n antifungal medication prescribed 8 days prior to the accident, which had the potential to substantially interfere with the metabolism of fentanyl).  The pilot was found wearing fentanyl patches in excess of the amount prescribed.  Postaccident toxicology testing performed on the pilot revealed fentanyl, carisoprodol, fluconazole, and gabapentin was detected in the pilot'sin her blood and urine.  The level of fentanyl detected in the pilot's blood was several times the maximum expected from typical use of doses prescribed.  The pilot had not noted her narcoctic dependence or use of any medications other than ibuprofen, on her applications for airmen medical certification.  If they had been reported, the certificate would have been denied.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor's improper decision to attempt a simulated engine failure at a low altitude and her failure to maintain clearance from trees and wires, while maneuvering. Also causal was the flight instructor's impairment from prescription medication."

During the landing, the airplane drifted right, and, despite the pilot\u2019s application of corrective flight controls, the airplane continued to drift away from the runway centerline. The pilot also noted that the right brake seemed to be unresponsive and that the application of the left brake aggravated the drift to the left. The right landing gear leg subsequently collapsed. Examination of the runway following the accident revealed that the right main landing gear wheel rim had broken apart, with the wheel hub separating from the outer wheel rim. Examination of the fracture surfaces revealed only fractures exhibiting features of overstress, rather than fatigue, although some of the fracture surfaces were smeared from contact forces and could not be evaluated. Review of maintenance and airworthiness records beyond the 13 months preceding the accident was not possible, as the records had been destroyed in a fire; therefore the exact service history of the wheel could not be determined. Review of available records showed that during each of the two annual inspections that were performed before the accident, at least some inspection or maintenance to the wheels was performed, with no discrepancies noted.",

The captained then exited at taxiway S4, and the local controller cleared the flight to cross runway 36C at Kilo. As the captain exited runway 36R, he asked the first officer \"where is Kilo?\" She responded \"on the right,\" indicating that Kilo was to their right. As the captain crossed 36C and entered the junction of taxiways Kilo, Charlie, and Charlie 5 he saw that gate C16 was off of his left side. He saw the marshaller and turned left towards the gate. Both flight crew members did not realize that the airplane had rolled off the taxiway until they felt the nose landing gear impact a concrete drainage ditch. Examination of the accident site by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the airplane was located in the grass median off the right side of taxiway Charlie, approximately 250 feet south of taxiway Kilo. The nose landing gear assembly had collapsed and the forward pressure bulkhead was punctured.

The pilot allowed the passenger to fly the airplane around the pattern; the pilot would then take control and accomplish a touch-and-go. They did this three times. During the last approach the pilot took control and put in a left slip to establish the glide slope. As he approached 30 feet above ground level, he attempted to level the wings and neutralize the rudder, however, he could not take out the right rudder input and the airplane continued into a right bank. The pilot added power and continued in a right-hand bank, but could not neutralize the controls. As the airplane came around 360 degrees he reduced the power, and decided to attempt a landing while over the runway. During the landing the right wing tip dragged, then the right balloon tire touched down, and the airplane translated sideways, collapsing the landing gear and nosing over.

After fueling, the pilot said that an engine run-up and a flight control check before departure were normal.  He then taxied for takeoff, and began the takeoff roll.  The pilot rotated the airplane into a climb attitude at 50 knots.  The airplane engine was developing 2,500 rpm, and the airplane began to climb at 65 knots.  After the airplane traveled beyond the departure end of the runway, where the terrain dropped away from the runway surface, the pilot indicated that the airplane immediately began to crab to the left and the flight controls felt sluggish or mushy. He began a slow climb, but said the flight controls became even more sluggish, resembling an imminent stall.  The pilot reported the sound of the engine began to drop as though it was losing power.  He began a slow turn to the left and the right wing dropped slightly, but he leveled the wings.  The pilot reported that the airplane began to descend in a stalled condition toward an area of trees.

Eyewitness and photographic evidence indicated that there was a low stratus cloud layer to the southwest, south, and southeast of the departure airport at the time of the takeoff. The airport, which had no air traffic control tower, was equipped with two similar-length runways, designated as 2/20 and 8/26. Airplane performance and terrain and obstacle clearance considerations did not preclude a takeoff from any of the four possible runway options. However, the pilot took off on runway 20, directly toward the low cloud layer.Eyewitnesses and recovered GPS data indicated that the airplane began a sharp left turn before reaching the end of the runway, at an altitude of about 400 feet above ground level (agl). That turn was consistent with an effort to avoid the cloud layer but was contrary to published airport noise abatement guidance that prohibited departure turns within the airport boundaries or at altitudes lower than 900 feet agl. Witnesses stated that the airplane did not enter the cloud layer; however, during the left turn, the airplane stalled, entered a spin, and descended rapidly to the ground. The airplane struck a parking lot and a building less than 700 feet from the departure runway. Postaccident examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any anomalies or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Despite three other runway alternatives, the pilot departed from the runway with a departure path that would take the airplane closest to the low cloud layer, with the apparent plan to turn to avoid it once airborne. The pilot\u2019s runway choice may have been influenced by habit, existing traffic, or a previous taxi event, but any of the other three runway alternatives would have taken him away from the cloud layer. The pilot then inadvertently stalled and spun the airplane during a turn to avoid the clouds at an altitude that did not allow for recovery.At least two headsets, one of which was a noise cancelling unit, were located in the wreckage. According to the airplane co-owner, the vane-activated, electrically-powered stall warning horn was inaudible to a pilot wearing a headset, and the owners\u2019 attempts to rectify that situation were unsuccessful. Postaccident testing of the stall vane switch and warning horn indicated that they were functional. During airplane manufacture, the final position of the stall warning vane and switch assembly on the wing is determined during the production flight test of each individual airplane to ensure system activation at the proper angle of attack. No records of the as-delivered vane position for the accident airplane were available, and the as-delivered vane position could not be discerned by examination of the wreckage. However, examination of the vane assembly revealed that it was not installed in accordance with the manufacturer's design drawings. In addition, no information regarding the accuracy of the modified stall warning system was located. Therefore, it was not possible to determine whether the system would have accurately provided sufficient, or even any, notification of a stall, presuming the horn was audible to the pilot, which in this case it likely was not.

The passenger stated that the pilot was using the radio and called in. The pilot made a hard left turn and advanced the throttle to full forward to avoid the other airplane. He added right aileron, but the airplane did not respond and continued turning left until it impacted terrain. It is likely that because of the slow airspeed, the aileron control input was not effective and the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. According to the pilot of the other airplane, during the landing flare, he noticed the accident airplane landing in the opposite direction, so he aborted the landing and climbed straight ahead. The pilot of the other airplane stated that he was monitoring frequency 122.8 MHz. Postaccident examination of the accident airplane revealed that the radio was set to 122.5 MHz as the active position and 122.8 MHz in the standby position; therefore, the pilot of the other airplane would not have heard his radio communications. At the time of the accident, the Bryan Aero Park did not have a common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for pilots to communicate on while operating at the air park. As a result of the investigation, Bryan Aero Park management has adopted 122.8 as the CTAF for pilots to communicate on while operating at the field.Although evidence indicates that the pilot had severe coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, and hypertension, no evidence was found indicating that the pilot's cardiac issues contributed to the accident.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot had been involved in a helicopter accident that occurred 10 hours 52 minutes before the airplane accident which the helicopter he was flying solo crashed onto the roof of a house. He sustained minor injuries and there were no injuries to the three occupants of the house. The pilot was transported to a hospital where a testing of a blood specimen taken 1 hour 40 minutes after the accident indicates 136 g/dL ethanol detected. Testing of a sample from the same specimen by the FAA Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory (CAMI) indicated 105 mg/dL ethanol in blood, or .105 percent by weight in blood. CAMI also detected acetone (1 mg/dL, mg/hg), acetaldehyde (8 mg/dL, mg/hg), citalopram (0.017 ug/ml,ug/g), and zolpidem (0.433 ug/ml,ug/g) in the blood specimen. The medical records from the hospital indicate a physician note at 2300 hours (approximately 1.5 hours after the accident), indicating slurred speech. A nursing note without a time stamp indicates the pilot admitted to ingesting ethanol \"earlier today.\" The primary diagnosis on the emergency department physician note is, \"ethanol intoxication, concussion.\" The pilot was released from the hospital to his parents at 0235 hours on the 4th of June, and he was transported to his apartment which he shared with a roommate. The roommate reported to the pilot's mother that on the day of the airplane accident, the pilot was watching television at 0630 hours. On the morning of the airplane accident sometime before 0710 hours, the pilot was observed taxiing the airplane to runway 36. Several witnesses reported hearing the pilot abruptly apply power to the engine several times before departing about 0709 hours. After takeoff the flight proceeded in a northwesterly direction and without establishing contact with the Tampa Approach Control or Tampa Air Traffic Control Tower, orbited for approximately 62 minutes while flying at approximately 2,200 feet. During this time an airplane that was inbound to KTPA was vectored by a controller to where the airplane was orbiting in an attempt to identify the airplane to controllers; the pilot reported seeing the pilot in the left side of the airplane. The pilot assisting air traffic control also reported that he believed the orbiting pilot was aware of the close proximity of the two airplane because it appeared to him that the orbiting pilot was maneuvering to avoid him. Attempts to communicate with the pilot on the departure airport CTAF were negative. Additionally, attempts by a flight crew member of a law enforcement helicopter to communicate with the pilot on guard (121.5 MHz) were also unsuccessful. After orbiting for 62 minutes, the airplane departed the orbits flying in a northwesterly direction for 1.6 minutes, then completed a 180 degree turn to the right. The airplane then flew in a southeasterly direction for 36 seconds, turned to the left flying in a northwesterly direction, then completed a right 360 degree descending turn. The airplane continued in a northwesterly direction, where the last primary radar target was noted in close proximity to the accident site. A witness located near the accident site area reported hearing the airplane flying at what she thought was a low altitude then heard the engine \"revving\" up followed by hearing the impact.  Several other witnesses across the street from the crash site reported hearing the engine sound that was steady with no sputtering.  The engine sound remained the same from the time they heard it until the impact. Another witness reported that he first observed the airplane when it was approximately 30-40 feet above the tops of trees.  The airplane at that time was in a 80-degree nose low attitude on  a southeast heading.  He observed the airplane collide with the trees then heard the impact. Examination of the accident site revealed damage to trees at decreasing heights. All components necessary to sustain flight were either attached or partially attached to the airplane or were found in close proximity to the main wreckage. Examination of the flight controls for roll, pitch, and yaw revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. The flaps were retracted. Examination of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. The No. 1 communication/navigation transceiver was in the on position with maximum volume and the active communication frequency was set to 119.9 MHz, which is the frequency for the East Satellite sector of the Tampa Air Traffic Control Tower. The autopsy report indicates the cause of death as blunt trauma, while the manner of death was listed as \"undetermined.\" A toxicology analysis by CAMI of postmortem specimens was positive in the blood for ethanol (69 mg/dL), acetaldehyde (82 mg/dL), citalopram (0.205 ug/ml, and zolpidem (1.54 ug/ml). The kidney tested positive for ethanol (84 mg/dL), citalopram, di-n-desmethylcitalopram, n-desmethylcitalopram, and zolpidem. The muscle tested positive for ethanol (105 mg/dL). The liver tested positive for citalopram, di-n-desmethylcitalopram, n-desmethylcitalopram, and zolpidem. The gastric contents tested positive for citalopram, di-n-desmethylcitalopram, n-desmethylcitalopram, and zolpidem. Carbon monoxide and cyanide testing was not performed. A note on the CAMI toxicology report indicates, \"The ethanol found in this case may potentially be from postmortem ethanol formation and not from the ingestion of ethanol.\" The levels of citalopram and zolpidem detected in the post mortem blood specimen are more than 12 times and more than 3 times, respectively, greater than the levels of each detected in a hospital blood specimen taken 1 hour 40 minutes following the first accident. Additionally, the CAMI toxicology report indicates citalopram and zolpidem were detected in the submitted postmortem gastric specimen. The pilot had been charged with DUI in May 2001, and reported such on his FAA medical application dated June 1, 2001. The pilot plead nolo contendere to the DUI charge on October 4, 2001. The pilot's medical records from his private physician indicate on May 23, 2002, he complained of insomnia, and depression. The doctor provided samples of 20 mg Celexa (citalopram), one-half tablet daily, and prescribed 10 mg Ambien, 1/2 to 1 tablet to be taken at bedtime. His physician did not request a psychiatric consultation or an inquiry regarding suicidal intent or alcohol/drug use.",
            "probable_cause": "The suicidal act by the pilot resulting in the in-flight collision with trees then the ground. A contributing factor in the accident was the pilot's depression. Findings in the investigation were the pilot's overdose of zolpidem and citalopram before the accident flight departed, and his intentional operation of the airplane while impaired by alcohol."

Prior to his departure, the airplane was fueled by the pilot from a 1,000 gallon metal tank located on his lake property.  During the fueling process, the metal tank's fuel supply was exhausted, but sufficient fuel was obtained to fill one fuel tank, and nearly fill the other.  Before departing for the day, the pilot purchased 15 gallons of additional fuel at a nearby airport and placed 5 gallons of the additional fuel in the airplane fuel tanks.  He then conducted two round-trip flights to the remote lake.  After a day of fishing at the remote lake, the pilot flew to his residence, and added 10 gallons of additional fuel to the airplane.  Two empty five gallon fuel cans were found at his dock.  He then departed on the accident flight to pick up additional passengers from the remote lake, but he did not arrive at his destination.  The airplane was located inverted in an area of tall trees.  The airplane flaps were extended full down.  The engine did not appear to be running at the time of the accident.  The airplane's fuel totalizer indicated 29 gallons of fuel.  A postaccident examination of the engine found no mechanical malfunctions.  Minor wrinkles were found along the bottom of each of the airplane's fuel bladders.  The gascolator contained about a teaspoon of water and particulate contamination.  The header tank had about an ounce of fuel and water.  The fuel pump contained no fuel.  Evidence of tan-colored particulate contamination was found in a fluid sample obtained from the fuel filter housing, attached to the pilot's fuel tank hand pump on his fuel tank.",

While there were no eyewitnesses who saw the departure or accident, one individual located east-northeast of the departure end of the runway heard a loud sound that she attributed to a northerly departure and then heard a sound that she associated with a backfire. Another individual reported hearing a surging or sputtering sound from the engine, followed by silence. About 850 feet from the approach end of the runway opposite the takeoff runway, the left wing collided with a tree. The airplane then descended, rolled inverted and impacted the ground. Both wing fuel tanks were breached during the accident and the amount of fuel on board the airplane at the time of the accident could not be determined. The right tank was selected to supply fuel to the engine, and first responders reported that fuel was leaking from that (breached) tank at the accident site. Examination of the flight controls, engine, engine systems, and fuel supply system revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.The flight previous to the accident flight occurred 7 weeks prior.

As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the aircraft's wings rocked similar to a wake turbulence encounter. The aircraft started descending at about 500 feet per minute although full throttle was applied and the aircraft was reportedly at best climb speed. The pilot tried to maneuver for a landing on the parallel runway (9L), but collided with terrain in an open dirt area about 500 feet short of the runway threshold. He estimated no more than 10 seconds elapsed from the time he felt the wings rock until he was on the ground. He added that there was no mechanical problem with the aircraft.

Data recovered from the on-board GPS system, which recorded the airplane's flight path and altitude, revealed that the pilot flew two full circles over the first field before beginning aerial application to that field. According to the operator, these circles were consistent with routine \"scouting\" passes to look for obstructions. The data showed that no similar \"scouting\" circles were flown over either the second or third field. The aerial application on the third field was completed in a small valley, and the pilot appeared to be set up to spray on an easterly heading, into the sun. Power lines were oriented on a north-south heading at the east end of this field. The airplane struck one of these power lines and then continued briefly in an easterly direction before it impacted terrain. Examination of the accident site revealed that a power line was severed from the impact and that pieces of the power line were among main wreckage. A postaccident examination did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal airplane operation. According to the operator, before a pilot sprays a field, it is normal to circle the field at least once to look for obstructions. Because the pilot did not adequately scout the area for potential hazards and was flying toward the sun, it is likely that he was not aware of the power lines and did not see them before impact.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a power line during an aerial application maneuver. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to identify potential obstructions in the area before beginning low-altitude maneuvers."

            "narrative": "On January 17, 2014, about 2040 eastern standard time, a Eurocopter AS350B3, N578AE, operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), was substantially damaged following an engine anomaly at Houlton International Airport (HUL), Houlton, Maine. The two commercial pilots were not injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The helicopter was operating on a company flight plan for the local public use flight. According to the copilot, the helicopter had just returned to HUL after a search and rescue mission, with the copilot flying. The crew then commenced takeoff and landing practice for night flight and night vision goggle recurrency.The copilot stated that he had completed three landings to runway 23, with one landing at the beginning, one near the middle, and one toward the end. He then took off again, hovered, and began a transition to forward flight with forward cyclic and a slight amount of increased collective. As he was beginning to apply cyclic, he heard and felt a loud explosion from the rear of the helicopter, followed by a severe vertical vibration, and the engine noise became very loud. The helicopter began to experience cyclic controllability problems along with some yaw instability as well. The pilot in command (PIC) called out the rotor rpm warning horn, but the copilot was unsure whether it was constant or intermittent due to the engine noise. Helicopter control continued to rapidly decay for the next 5 to 10 seconds, at which time the PIC took control.The copilot subsequently made two mayday calls over the radio, and almost immediately, the helicopter began \"severe\" pitch and roll oscillations. During some of the oscillations, the left side door came open, but the copilot was able to get it closed again. About that time, he also noticed the red GOV light was illuminated. After 10 to 20 seconds, the PIC was able to regain some control of the helicopter, there was a decrease in engine and rotor noise, and the PIC was able to land the helicopter beyond snow banks at the end of the runway. After performing an emergency shutdown, the PIC said he thought the helicopter was on fire, and although the FIRE light was not illuminated, there was an orange glow reflected in the snow. Upon exiting the helicopter, the copilot saw flames coming from the engine compartment; he tried to extinguish the fire with a portable fire extinguisher, but without effect. The local fire company arrived about 10 minutes later and subsequently extinguished the flames.According to the PIC, after the explosion, the Nr overspeed warning sounded and a vertical vibration developed. At that point, the helicopter had not yet begun yaw oscillations, so the PIC felt they still had tail rotor thrust. He could not quite hear if the Nr warning was intermittent or continuous (low Nr) and told the copilot they could have low rotor rpm. He believed that the copilot then lowered the collective slightly in response to his statement, but the noise increased and the oscillation began. The PIC then took control of the helicopter. As he did, he observed two amber caution lights and what he believed were two red warning lights. Severe vertical vibrations and almost uncontrollable yaw oscillations continued, as did a high Nr warning.The PIC then focused on trying to keep the helicopter's skids level, not hitting the ground, and not flying out of ground effect. He could not ascertain airspeed, and there were three instances when he estimated that the helicopter entered 30- to 40-degree banks. Throughout the event, the PIC could not adjust collective without inducing \"extreme\" attitude excursions. He could also not maintain the helicopter in a position where he could roll off the throttle. Then, after about 30 seconds, the attitude excursions began to \"calm down,\" and the pilot was able to land the helicopter beyond the snow bank. As the helicopter touched down, the PIC noted that the red FIRE light was not illuminated, and that the original two red lights he saw were actually an amber ENG CHIP light and the red GOV light. After the event, and reviewing training materials, the PIC was able to estimate that the amber lights he saw were the FUEL P and DOOR lights.   Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB personnel did not respond to the scene, while CBP investigators did, along with investigators from Airbus Helicopters (formerly American Eurocopter) and Turbomeca, who were serving as advisors to the state of manufacturer and design, France. The Arriel 2B engine and some additional components were removed from the helicopter and shipped to Turbomeca, where additional examinations occurred with NTSB oversight. Results are pending.",
