The commercial pilot was the sole occupant of the helicopter and was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to Sierra Flite, LLC, Camden, Delaware, and operated by Channel Islands Helicopters, LLC, Oxnard, California, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and no flight plan was filed. The local flight originated from Oxnard Airport (OXR) Oxnard, California at about 0930.According to representative from Channel Islands Helicopters, the pilot departed OXR after refueling and flew to Camarillo and then to SZP. The pilot was building flight time towards his rotorcraft commercial rating.A witness, who lived near the accident site, saw the helicopter flying in a northeasterly direction paralleling her property. The helicopter was below the tree line on the opposite side of the riverbed and was descending. The witness stated that the helicopter sounded normal but was unusually loud because it was so close. Shortly after losing sight of the helicopter, she heard two loud \"pops.\" Examination of the accident site by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) revealed that the helicopter impacted power lines and terrain about 1 and 1/2 miles west of SZP. The three phase overhead distribution power lines were separated directly over the accident site. These lines were supported by two wooden H-frame pole assemblies at a distance of about 1,000 feet from each other. The separated power lines were found in the surrounding bamboo vegetation and trees adjacent to the riverbed. Near the northern positioned H-frame, small spot fires were reported in the surrounding vegetation.",

The flight crew was unaware of the fan cowl separation until passengers pointed out the loss of both halves of the left engine fan cowl assembly.  The flight crew returned for an uneventful landing. After parking and deplaning the passengers, the flight crew noted additional damage to the left engine pylon, leading edge flaps, left main landing gear, and horizontal stabilator.  Examination of the engine fan cowls revealed that the cowl latch assembly and keeper housing assembly were intact, showed no evidence of malfunction, and exhibited no distortion or damage and that the cowling structure revealed no evidence of failure. Some delamination was found, but determined to not be contributory to the separation.  Maintenance records revealed that a scheduled maintenance inspection of the left engine had been performed prior to the flight which required the opening and closing of the engine fan cowls.  According to the operator\u2019s maintenance records, the left engine maintenance sign-off sheet revealed that a mechanic had latched and locked the fan cowls and this task had been verify by another mechanic.

If the latch is properly locked, the latch handle is flush with the cowling skin and painted portion of the latch handle is not visible.  Examination of an exemplar Airbus A320 engine fan cowl revealed the possibility of a false latch condition that would mask an otherwise unlatched position.  It was reported that mechanics working on the engine routinely push the latch assembly up against the latch keeper housing assembly in order to stow the latch to avoid inadvertent head injuries while working underneath engine.  In this position, the latch is neither latched nor locked but the latch assembly may be flush with the cowling so that the paint on the latch handle is not visible, giving a false indication that the latch is properly locked  Examination of the latch hardware revealed no mechanical damage such as would be expected if the latches were secured and locked at the time of the cowling separation.",
            "probable_cause": "The separation of both halves of the left engine fan cowl assembly due to improper latching and locking of the all the fan cowl latches. The cause of the improper latching and locking of the fan cowls was due to the failure of the mechanic to unstow and properly latch and lock the fan cowl latches after the engine maintenance had been completed, and the failure of the maintenance  inspector to detect and identify the unlatched condition. Contributing the incident is the design of the fan cowl latch assembly that can provide a false latch condition when the latch is neither latched or locked. Also contributing incident is the lack of adequate Airbus and Jet Blue fan cowl latch inspection guidance to detect and identify an unlatched condition."

On the day of the accident, good visual meteorological conditions existed.  Examination of ground scars and damage patterns in the wreckage suggests that the airplane collided with the level desert terrain in a nose low and approximately a wings level attitude.  Although the wreckage location is consistent with the airplane being on a right base leg for runway 3 or an attempted 180-degree return to runway 21 maneuver; the investigation was unable to determine if the event occurred during initial climb or during landing approach to an airport located about 1 mile away.  Earlier during the day, the pilot had landed at the airport.  An entry was noted on the airport's sign-in sheet indicating that the pilot had been there for lunch.  No witnesses recalled observing the pilot depart from the uncontrolled airport, and his takeoff time was estimated as being after noon.  An examination of the airplane wreckage revealed two of the three propeller blades were fractured; the third blade appeared intact.  Blade fragments were found in the ground at the initial point of impact (IPI).  The distance from the IPI to the farthest piece of wreckage was about 65 feet, and the track was nearly perpendicular to the runway.

The fuel leak was subsequently repaired, and a final inspection the morning of the accident flight reportedly did not reveal any evidence of a continued fuel leak. Shortly after takeoff, the flight crew noticed a faint odor in the cockpit and a small amount of smoke near the radio room. The flight crew immediately initiated a turn with the intention of returning to the departure airport. About that time, they received a radio call from the pilot of the accompanying airplane advising that there was a fire visible on the left wing. The accident pilot subsequently executed an emergency landing to a corn field. Emergency crews were hampered by the muddy field conditions, and the fire ultimately consumed significant portions airframe.In-flight photographs showed the presence of fire on the aft lower portion of the left wing between the inboard and outboard engines. Located in the same area of the fire were fuel tanks feeding the left-side engines. After landing, heavy fire conditions were present on the left side of the airplane, and the fire spread to the fuselage.A postaccident examination noted that the C-channel installed as part of the No. 1 main fuel tank repair earlier in the week was partially separated. During the examination, the tank was filled with a small amount of water, which then leaked from the aft section of the repair area in the vicinity of the partially separated channel. Metallurgical examination of the repair area revealed a longitudinal fatigue crack along the weld seam.The fatigue nature of the crack was consistent with a progressive failure along the fuel tank seam that existed before the accident flight and was separate from the damage sustained in the emergency landing and postlanding fire. The repair earlier in the week attempted to seal the leak but did not address the existing crack itself. In fact, the length of the crack observed at the time of the repair was about one-half the length of the crack noted during the postaccident examination, suggesting that the crack progressed rapidly during the course of the accident flight. Because the repaired fuel tank was positioned within the open wing structure, a fuel leak of significant volume would have readily vaporized, producing a flammable fuel vapor/air mixture. Although the exact ignition source could not be determined due to the fire damage, it is likely that the fuel vapor and liquid fuel encountered hot surfaces from nearby engine components, which initiated the in-flight fire.",

After shutting down the #2 engine and actuating the fire extinguishing system, the crew executed a single engine landing followed by a normal taxi to the ramp and normal passenger debarkation. Inspection of the P&W; 127 series engine showed that a fuel transfer tube adjacent to the #2 nozzle was misaligned and 'backed out' of its retaining clip. Fuel streaking and fire damage were evident down the right side of the engine from the #2 nozzle downward along the fuel nozzle ring assembly. The incident occurred 3.4 hours after the fuel nozzles, retaining clips, and transfer tubes were replaced during maintenance on the #2 engine. The engine manufacturer had published several service bulletins addressing the potential of incorrectly installing the retaining clips and recommending that existing clips be replaced with stronger lock plates that provide a positive locking mechanism to avoid misalignment during installation. The manufacturer issued a Service Bulletin in October 1994 and Transport Canada issued an AD in November 1996, both citing how the retaining clips could be installed 'out of position' and recommending that operators use the newer lock plate. The FAA had published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on July 17, 1995, addressing the aforementioned issues. FAA AD 98-14-02 was published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1998.

Another witness observed the helicopter perform two 180-degree turns before it descended and impacted the ground. Examination of the accident site confirmed a vertical impact, and the helicopter damage was consistent with low or minimal rotor speed at the time of impact. Inspection of the fuel system revealed no fuel in the right fuel tank and about 2 pints of fuel in the left fuel tank. No contamination was observed in the fuel on board, and no obstructions were observed in the fuel system. The experimental amateur-built helicopter was constructed from a kit and received its airworthiness certificate in 2003. The pilot purchased the helicopter about 4 months before the accident through the kit manufacturing company, which was brokering the sale of the helicopter for the builder\u2019s estate. The pilot did not hold a pilot certificate and did not register the helicopter with the FAA. Examination of the pilot's logbook revealed that about 2 years before the accident, he had received 3.2 hours of helicopter instruction. Interviews revealed that when the pilot acquired the helicopter, he flew an additional 15 hours with the owner of the helicopter kit manufacturing company (in the accident helicopter and another company helicopter). However, these flights were limited to hover practice.It is likely that while the pilot was maneuvering the helicopter at a low altitude, it experienced a loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. At this point, the pilot needed to immediately enter an autorotation. However, given the pilot\u2019s limited flight training and his lack of pilot certification (he would have had to demonstrate an autorotation in order to become a certificated helicopter pilot), he almost certainly was not proficient in performing autorotations.

The pilot setup the balloon for takeoff from a 798-foot-long open field, 298 feet upwind from 21,000-volt power lines.  The FAA approved flight manual specifies that a horizontal distance of 100 feet for each 1-knot of wind speed be allowed between the takeoff point and any obstacle in the takeoff path.  During the envelope inflation process, a 7- to 10-mph surface wind developed, which started dragging the basket toward the lines.  The pilot elected to continue with the planned flight.  He and the two fare-paying passengers took off and drifted into the power lines, which shorted and arced.  An unapproved aluminum fuel tank in the basket ruptured and ignited the basket, envelope, and occupants.  The pilot jumped from the basket and sustained serious injuries.  The passengers remained in the basket and succumbed to thermal injuries.  The balloon had been modified by the addition of an uncertified aluminum fuel tank to the two existing factory tanks that were composed of steel.

He did not establish contact with air traffic control at any time during the flight, nor did he enter controlled airspace on the assigned heading of 180 degrees. According to the NTSB Air Traffic Control (ATC) Radar Study, the flight climbed to approximately 1,800 feet msl, and continued in a direction northwest of the departure airport while turning left, right, and then left with slight changes in altitude. The airplane then began a right descending turn with the bank angle and turn rate increasing beyond the standard rates and angles, and the load factor reached close to maximum limits.

The area between the first set of propeller strikes and the second set was clear of any marks.  The inspector observed skid marks that began at the second set of propeller strikes and continued down the runway where the airplane departed the runway.  The airplane had flown 2 hours since a routine maintenance inspection that included many components of the landing gear system.  No discrepancies were noted on the failed components of the right main landing gear.  Post accident inspection by the operator's maintenance personnel found that the pivot bolt in the right main landing gear bellcrank assembly (part number NAS 464P4-26) had sheared in two places, and the clevis ears at both ends of the bell crank were fractured.  They said that this lead to other parts shifting and breaking, which lead to the right main landing gear collapsing.  Metallurgical examination of the bell crank, the clevis ears, and the bolt determined that all of the materials examined were within specification.  None of the fractures showed any evidence of pre-existing damage or fatigue cracking.  The bolt fractured in shear overstress on a plane flush with the edge of the bellcrank.  The damage to the pivot bolt appeared to be most consistent with an event where the gear was heavily loaded outward, away from its normal retracted position.  Detailed analysis of the loadings on the failed components and the lack of damage on the surrounding structures and landing gear parts revealed no obvious scenario that would have led to the bellcrank being the first component loaded sufficiently to cause the damage observed and/or initiate the collapse of the landing gear.  It is most likely that the damage to the bellcrank was a result of the collapse of the gear, rather than a cause.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's inadequate flare and touchdown that imparted high side loadings on the right main landing gear, which resulted in an overload failure of the landing gear bellcrank and the collapse of that gear."

The pilot said that control of the airplane was regained after reducing engine power to 1,500 rpm, and stabilizing the airspeed at 100-knots.  He added that subsequent airplane control was accomplished via aileron and power inputs. The pilot flew to an airport about 75 miles from where the loss of control occurred. On short final for the intended runway, he lowered the landing gear. The airplane entered a dive and collided with terrain about 300 yards short of the runway in a nose-low attitude, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe. According to first responders to the accident, the pilot told them that he encountered severe turbulence, and momentarily lost control of the airplane. Examination of the airplane revealed that both ruddervators had separated from their respective stabilizer attach points at some earlier time during the flight. The ruddervators were not found at the accident site, and only remnants remained attached to the hinge points on the stabilizers. The remaining pieces of ruddervator were examined. The examination revealed no evidence of preexisting cracks, fatigue, or corrosion damage, and all fracture features were consistent with overstress separations. For the portions of the flight documented by radar coverage, the data indicated calculated true airspeeds routinely above design maneuvering speed (VA-132-kts), with two sustained periods at design cruising speed (VC-165-kts), and occasional periods 5 to 12-knots above VC.

According to the pilot, prior to initiating the planned round-robin flight he had experienced a left magneto problem during the engine run-up procedure at the Whiteman Airport in Los Angeles.  The pilot stated that he had \"cleared the problem during the run-up...\" and his takeoff from Whiteman was normal.  No evidence of any engine problem was encountered during the flight to Torrance, whereupon the pilot landed without incident.  However, the pilot reported to the local air traffic controller during his subsequent departure (initial climb) that he would like to turn around and land in the opposite direction to the departure runway.  The pilot broadcast to the controller that he has \"...got a little engine trouble here.\"  The pilot reported that during the climb to about 700 feet above ground level, only partial engine power was attained.  The controller responded by clearing the pilot to land on any runway and provided the local wind condition.  Thereafter, the pilot reversed course.  With a 10-knot tailwind, the pilot misjudged his downwind approach and landing on the mile-long runway.  The pilot opined that he touched down too long to decelerate on the remaining available runway, so he responded by applying engine power to take off again.  With extended wing flaps, the airplane became airborne.  The pilot lost control of the airplane while he again reversed course to return to the airport.  The airplane's stall warning horn activated, and the airplane buffeted and crashed while in an uncontrolled descent.  During the subsequent engine examination, no evidence of any mechanical malfunction was found.  At the time of the accident the Torrance airport METAR was reporting a temperature of 26 degrees Centigrade and dew point 21 degrees.  With reference to a carburetor icing probability chart, the temperature and dew point falls into an area of the chart labeled moderate icing in cruise power or serious icing at glide power. ",

The airplane was registered to FLITESERV LLC., Long Beach, California, and operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) personal cross-country flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and both the private pilot and pilot-rated passenger received serious injuries. The flight departed Long Beach Airport (KLGB), Long Beach, California, about 1245.During a telephone interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on June 26, the owner of the airplane said that the pilot and passenger were both pilot rated students of a CFR Part 141 flight school, working on advanced ratings. The pilot had rented the airplane to make a cross-country flight. When queried about their destination, the pilot reported Agua Dulce Airport. The owner explained that Agua Dulce Airport did not meet the distance requirement for the advanced rating, and suggested that they overfly Agua Dulce Airport, and continue to General William J Fox Field (KWJF), Lancaster, California, which would meet the distance requirement.On June 20, the pilot was interviewed by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air safety inspector following the accident. The pilot reported that he had elected to land at the Agua Dulce Airport, and depart on runway 04. The FAA Airport Facility Directory indicates that runway 04 has a 1.9% uphill slope. The terrain off the end of runway 04 is rising. During the takeoff roll, the pilot said he didn't think the airplane was accelerating fast enough, and he pulled the power to abort the takeoff. At that point, he said the pilot-rated passenger took the controls, applied full power, and continued the takeoff. The airplane was climbing slowly, but the stall warning horn was sounding, and he thought the pilot-rated passenger was going to stall the airplane. He said he resumed control, and pushed the nose of the airplane down to increase the airspeed. The main landing gear contacted high-voltage power lines crossing their path, and the airplane descended impacting the terrain.

The pilot said he noticed snow drifts across the approach end of the runway, and he decided to over-fly the area of drifted snow.  The airplane touched down about 1,000 feet from the approach end.  Because there was snow on the remaining portion of the runway, the pilot said he kept his roll-out speed higher than normal to avoid getting stuck in the snow.

The nose of the airplane was observed to level out and the engine started and lost power again. The airplane was observed to enter a steep bank to the left estimated between 45 to 100 degrees. The nose of the airplane pitched down and two witnesses observed the airplane level out before it collided with the ground. The Pilot's Operating Handbook states that the airplane would stall with flaps up at 75 knots with a 45-degree angle of bank, and at 85 knots with 60-degree angle of bank. A friend of the pilot who flew in the airplane the day before the accident stated that he thought the left main fuel gauge indicated empty and the right main fuel gauge indicated half full. There was no record indicating that the airplane had been refueled before the pilot started conducting sightseeing flights lasting 10 to 15 minutes each on the day of the accident. One passenger who flew on the first sightseeing flight stated that she could not see both fuel gauges, however one fuel gauge was in the yellow range. A passenger on the second flight stated that the left fuel gauge indicated empty and the right fuel gauge was less than a quarter tank. The Pilot Operating Handbook states in Section II, Limitations, do not take off if fuel quantity gauges indicate in the yellow band or with less than 13 gallons in each main tank. The pilot flew a total of three flights before the accident flight without shutting the airplane down. The airplane holds a total of 40 gallons of fuel in the left and right main fuel tanks. Three gallons of fuel are unusable in each fuel tank. The left and right main fuel tanks were ruptured and there was no evidence of fuel or browning of vegetation at the crash site.

The spray deflector is designed to deflect water and other runway material kicked up by the nose wheel away from the rear-mounted engines which could cause flameouts and engine damage.  About one-third of the spray deflector was broken off.  Laboratory examination of the deflector revealed the fracture was typical of overstress.

The private pilot and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the cross-country flight that attempted to depart LEX at 1440 and was destined for Oakland County International Airport (PTK), Pontiac, Michigan. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. In his written statement, the pilot reported that he completed a preflight and engine run-up before departing LEX. The airplane lifted off the runway and, about 200 feet above ground level (agl), the engine \"backfired\" several times, which was followed by a partial loss of power. The pilot subsequently pulled the power back to idle and attempted to land the airplane on the remaining runway. The airplane overran the end of the runway and collided with the precision approach path indicator lights, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings. The pilot's statement was corroborated by multiple witnesses. A postaccident examination was conducted by the engine manufacturer under the supervision of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector. An engine test run with new magnetos revealed no anomalies when either the right or both magnetos were selected. When the magneto switch was turned to the left position the engine produced only partial power as evidenced by several cylinder misfires. The engine was test run again after the magneto switch was bypassed, which produced the same result. The examination also revealed a significant amount of contamination on three of the fuel injectors. The engine was test run again after each injector was cleaned; however, the engine still produced only partial power when the left magneto was selected. The ignition harness was tested using an ignition lead tester and no anomalies were identified. The airplane and engine were retained for further examination at a later date.",

The hose was still connected to the flow divider and retained torque on the fitting.

Examination of the fuel line fitting still attached to the fuel servo revealed threads in the socket were clean with no residual hose material present in the threads.

The helicopter entered an uncommanded and uncontrollable right spin as it descended to ground impact.  During the approach, and after passing over a group of trees, while the helicopter was about 15 to 30 feet above ground level (agl) and 60 feet from the intended touchdown location, the helicopter began a rapid, uncommanded right yaw.  The pilot input full left pedal pressure in an effort to stop the rotation.  Despite his attempts, the pilot's control inputs had no effect on the spin rate.  The pilot retarded the left engine throttle, and maneuvered the helicopter away from the trees as it continued to descend.  Upon touchdown, the helicopter rolled on its left side, and the main rotor blades impacted terrain.  The helicopter's NOTAR anti-torque yaw control system utilizes a transmission driven fan with variable pitch blades to supply air to circulation control slots on the tail boom and a pilot-controlled directional jet thruster nozzle.  Movement of the anti-torque control pedals changes the fan blade pitch to produce more airflow to the circulation control slots and the anti-torque thruster nozzle.  As the pedals are displaced from center toward either extreme of travel, the airflow increases proportionally.  During post-accident examination of the NOTAR control system, a fracture and separation was found in the force limiting control rod.  With the rod assembly disconnected, the NOTAR fan blades assume a neutral pitch, preventing a sufficient volume of air in the tail boom to provide anti-torque control and maintain a heading.  The helicopter had previous mechanical problems with the rod assembly and it was replaced about 779 hours prior to the accident.  Using a scanning electron microscope, an examination of the fracture surface revealed that the rod separated due to a fatigue crack originating from the base of the thread roots, and final tension overload.  There was no evidence of damage sites, foreign material inclusions, or other potential fracture initiating conditions.",

As a result, the aircraft did not lift off the ground at a point that it otherwise would have. Because the pilot did not abort the takeoff when it became clear that the aircraft was not performing as it should, the aircraft lifted off late, collided with some trees and a fence, and then settled back onto the terrain. It then experienced a collapse of all three landing gear. There was no indication that there had been any malfunction of an aircraft system, or that the engine was not capable of producing full power.

The witness stated that the airplane was about \"tree-top level\" when it pitched down and impacted the ground.  Examination by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed oil along the bottom side of the fuselage and on the tailwheel.  A friend of the pilot, who was also an aircraft mechanic, reported that prior to the accident flight he and the pilot found an oil leak originating from a stainless steel high-pressure oil line from the propeller governor to the forward area of the engine crankcase.  The mechanic stated that he had removed the oil line and the pilot had it repaired by a local weld shop.  After reinstallation of the oil line, the mechanic conducted an engine run and did not observe any oil leaks originating from the oil line.  The pilot then decided to fly the airplane around the area on a test flight.  According to the mechanic, as the airplane departed the runway, he observed a trail of white smoke originating from the airplane.  Despite two requests by the mechanic to return to the airport, the pilot stated that \"everything was fine\" and he was going to continue to a nearby airport.  No further radio communication was received from the pilot.  Examination of the engine revealed that the stainless steel high pressure oil line from the propeller governor was in place.  The oil line exhibited a repair weld on the forward area of the line, and corresponding wear marks were observed on the engine crankcase.  The oil line was removed and the forward end of the oil line was capped off using a bolt.  The area of the weld was placed under water and compressed air pressure was applied to the opposite end of the oil line.  A leak was observed originating from the area of the weld.  Partial disassembly of the engine revealed that the number two connecting rod was separated from the crankshaft and exhibited signatures consistent with oil starvation.",

Shortly thereafter, engine oil was noted on the windscreen, and the engine lost power.  Subsequently, the pilot initiated a forced landing to a field.  During the forced landing, the airplane impacted terrain and the nose and right main landing gears collapsed.  Examination of the airplane revealed the right wing was buckled.  A review of the maintenance records revealed that most recent annual inspection was completed on November 11, 2005, at a total airframe time of 3,358 hours.  The engine had accumulated 257 hours since major overhaul and 49 hours since the annual inspection.  No additional maintenance besides an oil change was performed on the engine since the November 11th inspection.  Examination and disassembly of the engine revealed that connecting rods had been fractured and separated. The pistons were found separated from the connecting rods.  The six pistons displayed cracks and fractures along the piston pin bosses, and mechanical damage was noted on the bottom side of the piston.  The pistons were retained for further examination by the NTSB materials laboratory.  The connecting rod and main bearings displayed evidence of discoloration and heat signatures.  The crankshaft counterweights were separated from the crankshaft.  Metallurgical examination of two pistons revealed that fractures along the boss for the piston pin were consistent with overstress separation in a casting.  ",

The flight instructor and student pilot were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The local instructional flight was operating in the traffic pattern at Lancaster Airport (LNS), Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the flight instructor, prior to the flight he added 14 gallons of fuel (7 gallons in each wing tank).  He then ran the engine on the ground for about 20 minutes to charge the battery after having jumpstarted the engine. They taxied the airplane and \"did a full run up\" before takeoff. The flight remained in the traffic pattern at LNS and performed two touch-and-go landings on runway 08. While on the base leg of the traffic pattern for the third landing, the flight instructor heard a \"funny noise\" and then noticed the engine was no longer producing power. He attempted to restart the engine without success. He then turned toward a cornfield and proceeded with a forced landing.A Federal Aviation Administration Inspector examined the airplane at the accident scene. The airplane came to rest inverted in a cornfield about 1.7 miles southeast of the approach end of the intended landing runway. Crop damage leading up to the wreckage was about 90 feet long and oriented east- northeast. The outboard section of the right wing leading edge, fuselage nose section, rudder and left main landing gear were substantially damaged. Flight control continuity was confirmed.The engine was retained for further examination.",

The instructor and student pilot then departed on a training flight.  On short final for his third landing, the student had 65 knots on the airspeed indicator, 30 degrees of flaps set, and the carburetor heat on.  As the student flared the airplane, a gust of wind lifted the right wing, and the instructor took control of the airplane.  The instructor was unable to aligned the airplane with the runway.  He added full power, did not touch the flaps or carburetor heat, and executed a go around.  When the instructor added power, the nose of the airplane pulled more to the left, and the ground track was in line with two hangars.  He avoided the hangars, but was heading for a small field.  Unable to maintain level flight, and in an attempt to gain airspeed, the flight instructor lowered the nose of the airplane.  The airplane continued to descend, and the flight instructor stated that 'he flared as much as possible to soften the touchdown (impact).' According to information manual for the aircraft , 'In a balked landing (go around) climb, reduce the flap setting to 20 degrees immediately after full power is applied.  If obstacles must be cleared during the go-around climb, reduce the wing flap setting to 10 degrees and maintain a safe airspeed until the obstacles are cleared...after clearing any obstacles, the flaps may be retracted as the airplane accelerates to the normal flaps-up climb speed.'

The purpose of the flight was to reposition the helicopter to the operator's base, after a patient delivery to a regional medical center.  The approximate 10-miles in diameter lake is a shallow non-perennial body of water located about 11 miles east of the operators base.  The wreckage was located about 2.5 miles from the east shore line and about 3.5 miles from the west shore.  The lake is on a normal routing from the hospital to the operator's base.  The flight nurse said he was sitting directly behind the pilot in a forward facing seat.  He said that usually they crossed the lake about 500 feet above the surface, but this time they were much lower.  He estimated that they had descended to within 20 to 50 feet of the lake surface, and, as they flew further out over the water they seemed to get lower and lower.  He looked over the pilot's shoulder, and to the right, and noted how glassy smooth the water was.  He stated that it was like a mirror and reflected the clouds and the sky perfectly, and was \"kind of mesmerizing and disorienting\" to see clouds both above and below with no distinct horizon.  Just before they hit the water the pilot said on the intercom, \"Boy, it's disorienting when the lake is this smooth.\"  The nurse looked out the right side window at the distant shoreline and thought to himself that the flight seemed very, very low.  The helicopter then hit the water.  The flight nurse and paramedic medical crew members stated that there were no apparent mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter prior to the collision with the lake surface.  Examination of the extensively fragmented helicopter disclosed that all control system torque and push/pull tubes, and their associated rod end fittings, were accounted for.  Scoring and other rotational evidence was noted on all drive system components. ",
            "probable_cause": "Failure of the pilot to maintain sufficient altitude/clearance above the water while performing a low altitude flight.  Factors relating to the accident were the glassy water condition, and a lack of visual cues concerning perception of altitude."

According to pilot, after takeoff, the flight climbed briefly to 3,000 feet mean sea level (msl), descended to and remained at 2,500 feet msl, and then proceeded to the destination airport. When the flight was near the destination airport, the pilot reduced both throttles to 21 inches manifold pressure, and began descending at less than 500 feet-per-minute. Approximately 15 miles from the destination, while flying at 1,500 feet msl, the right engine \"coughed a couple times\" with corresponding right yaw. The pilot noted the right fuel flow was \"down\" and described a split between the left and right fuel flow readings. He reported that the left and right fuel quantity gauges indicated 70 and 100 pounds respectively, at a point just before the ditching. He turned the right auxiliary fuel pump to the low position, and moved the right fuel selector to the \"left main\" position in an effort to restore engine power; however, the right engine lost engine power, followed by the left engine. Following recovery of the airplane, a total of 14 ounces of fuel were drained from the left main fuel tank and no fuel was recovered from the right main fuel tank. Historical fuel records associated with the accident airplane revealed the average fuel burn was approximately 35.09 gallons-per-hour, the actual fuel load for the accident flight being only 119 pounds, instead of the pilot reported 280 pounds. The pilot did not visually inspect the fuel tanks. Rather, he relied on gauge readings and his fuel calculations, that amount only allowed approximately 34 minutes of flight at the typical power settings. Testing of components of the fuel quantity indicating system revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Both engines were operated postaccident with no preimpact failure or mechanical malfunction noted.",
