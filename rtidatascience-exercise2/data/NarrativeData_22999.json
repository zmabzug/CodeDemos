            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.About 5 minutes before the accident, when the airplane was in cruise flight in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), at 8,000 ft mean sea level (msl), and at 156 knots ground speed, an air traffic controller updated the altimeter setting via the radio. The pilot acknowledged the call, and his voice sounded normal. No other radio transmissions were received from the pilot, and he made no distress calls. Radar data showed that the airplane then began a descending right turn, that the airspeed increased slightly through the turn, and that the airspeed then suddenly decreased to 61 knots as the turn radius decreased. The airplane had turned about 270 degrees and descended to an altitude of 4,900 ft msl before radar contact was lost. A witness reported seeing the airplane coming out of the low clouds (the cloud ceiling was about 700 to 800 ft above ground level) in a nose-down descent with the wings about level before it disappeared behind a tree line. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact anomalies.Data from the on-board recoverable data module (RDM) showed an anomaly in the electrical bus voltages, autopilot mode changes, and a momentary dropout of the pilot transmission frequency. Specifically, the RDM data showed that the airplane was flying at 8,000 ft pressure altitude at an airspeed of 148 knots with the autopilot on when alternator 1 dropped offline followed by alternator 2 dropping offline; the airplane is equipped with a two-alternator, two-battery, 28-volt direct current electrical system. About 3 seconds later, the autopilot disengaged. The RDM data confirmed that the airplane then entered a descending right turn with the airspeed increasing slightly and then suddenly decreasing. The data further showed that the airplane then rolled right and that the pitch attitude sharply decreased. The airspeed then increased, and both the roll and pitch reversed back toward wings level before the data ended.The bolster switches for alternator 1, alternator 2, battery 1, battery 2, and the avionics were cycled \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d on an exemplar airplane to determine what may occur in the cockpit when the bolster switches are manually moved. Seven sets of various electrical bolster switch activations and deactivations were documented. During the tests, bolster switch operation on the exemplar airplane yielded recorded data similar to the accident flight data; however, the reason for the recorded electrical anomalies could not be determined because the RDM does not record the physical position of either the bolster switches or circuit breakers. The data did reveal that the airplane began its deviation off course and its subsequent descending right turn in IMC conditions a few seconds after the alternators went offline and that the pilot was likely attempting to troubleshoot the electrical anomaly with bolster switch activations and deactivations as the airplane descended and turned through the clouds. The electrical anomalies likely distracted the pilot and led to his subsequent loss of airplane control. The witness\u2019s statement that the airplane came out of the low clouds with the wings about level and the RDM data indicate that the pilot may have been able to recover from the turn and rapid descent to some degree but that there was insufficient altitude for a full recovery. \u000b\u000b\u000b",

The fuel tanks were filled to maximum capacity, and the estimated gross weight was about 130 pounds less than the maximum gross weight. During the takeoff, a witness at the airport observed that as the airplane traveled down the runway there was no change in engine sound. The witness further stated that as the airplane lifted out of ground effect , it did not climb any higher. It continued down the runway and at its end, the witness saw the airplane stall and turn to the left, prior to ground impact. The PUI reported that during the takeoff, \u201cWe used virtually the entire runway for takeoff.\u201d The PUI was focused on obstacles ahead of the runway and notified the CFI that they had cleared the obstacles. The PUI indicated that the CFI then assumed control of the airplane and entered the airplane into a climb to clear additional obstacles. The PUI stated that as the flight controls were pulled back it felt like they had less available power, most likely due to the attitude of the airplane. The airplane then collided with obstacles. Post accident engine examination showed that the intake lifter for the Number 4 cylinder camshaft lobe was worn and the follower was heavily pitted. Both the intake and exhaust lifter for the Number 3 cylinder were heavily scored and the corresponding camshaft lobes were heavily worn. While the exact amount of degradation to the engine's power output could not be established, the alteration of the cam lobe profile will alter the amount and duration of the valve opening, thus affecting power output. The engine was overhauled 10 years prior to the accident and had accrued about 330 hours during this time. Although the engine's storage history for the last 10 years could not be determined, the amount of corrosion and pitting found make it highly likely that the internal engine components corroded due to inadequate lubrication resulting from lack of consistent operation. Lycoming Service Letter L180B states that, \"Engines in aircraft that are flown only occasionally may not achieve normal service life because of corrosion.\" A Lycoming publication states that, \u201cCorrosion is a known cause of tappet and cam lobe wear. The engines of aircraft that are not flown regularly may be extremely vulnerable to corrosion...Once started, the process is not likely to stop until it reaches a point where these parts are doing an unacceptable job.\u201d",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of both pilots to abort the takeoff when a suitable climb rate could not be attained. Contributing to the accident was the reduction of available power due to the camshaft lobe and lifter corrosion/wear, the high density altitude, and the CFI\u2019s inadequate supervision."

This allowed the number three cylinder exhaust valve to remain in the closed position during the time that it should have been open, resulting in a loss of power.  The rocker box casting was sent to the NTSB metallurgical laboratory for further analysis.

Using a combination of aileron input and the remaining amount of rudder control, he was able to maneuver the airplane for a landing on the airstrip.

The area forecast contained an AIRMET for IFR conditions and mountain obscuration due to clouds and light snow.  The terminal forecast contained expected conditions that included visibilities ranging from 3 to 3/4 mile in blowing snow, a vertical visibility of 500 feet, and wind speeds from 14 to 22 knots.  During the filing of the flight plan, an FAA flight service station specialist advised that VFR flight was not recommended.  The pilot acknowledged the weather information and departed.  When the pilot took off on the return flight from an airport 128 miles east of his home base, the pilot reported that the visibility at his base was greater than 6 miles.  As he neared his home base, the visibility had decreased and other pilots in the area were requesting special VFR clearances into the Class E surface area.  The pilot requested a special VFR clearance at 1441, but had to hold outside the surface area for other VFR and IFR traffic.  At 1453, a METAR at the airport included a wind 080 of 26 knots, and a visibility of 1 mile in blowing snow.  While holding about 7 miles north of the airport, the pilot provided a pilot report that included deteriorating weather conditions east of the airport.  Once the pilot was cleared to enter the surface area at 1458, he was provided with an airport advisory that included wind conditions of 25 knots, gusting to 33 knots.  While the pilot was maneuvering for the approach, a special aviation weather observation at 1501 included a wind condition of 26 knots, and a visibility of 3/4 mile in blowing snow.  The pilot said he established a GPS waypoint 4 miles from the runway and descended to 1,000 feet.  He continued inbound and descended to 300 feet.  At 1 mile from the airport, the pilot said he looked up from the instrument panel but could not see the airport.  He also stated that he was in a whiteout condition.

This was the third airport the pilot tried to land after unsuccessful attempts due to low clouds and visibilities at two other airports. During the ILS approach to JAX, the air traffic controller advised the pilot that two flights had landed earlier with each reporting breaking out of the clouds 50 to 100 feet above the decision height and initially only the approach lights being visible. The pilot subsequently radioed he was on a missed approach. The controller, and another flight on the ground later heard a partially unclear transmission with the pilot indicating his instruments were malfunctioning. Witnesses either heard or saw the airplane over fly the airport. Two witnesses stated they heard the sounds of the engine increase and one reported he thereafter heard the airplane turn north, circle several times, and descend followed by the sound of a crash. Recorded radar data indicate that before radar contact was lost the airplane did complete circling turns to the left while at the same time climbing to 1000 feet and then descending to 300 feet.

About 40 minutes after departure the pilot reported to air traffic control (ATC) that he was encountering icing conditions at his cruise altitude of 13,000 feet and requested a lower altitude. The pilot was cleared to descend to 11,000 feet. The pilot continued to encounter icing conditions and was cleared to descend to lower altitudes.

The pilot received a weather briefing prior to the flight; however, it was limited by his request to wind, temperature aloft forecasts and METAR observations for his route of flight.

He noted that both inboard (main) fuel tanks were essentially empty and that both outboard (tip) tanks were almost full. He stated that he performed the accident takeoff using fuel from the left tip tank. Before takeoff, he verified that no anomalies existed with the engine operation during the engine check and when he applied power for takeoff. The pilot performed a short-field takeoff with 20 degrees of flaps. The pilot stated that, as the airplane approached the departure end of the runway, the engine experienced a \"quick loss of power,\" which was shortly followed by a sustained loss of power. The pilot immediately performed a forced landing in a parking lot just north of the departure threshold. During the forced landing, the airplane impacted a shopping cart corral and a tree and then slid down an embankment. The right wing tip and tank were sheared off during impact, and a postimpact ground fire ensued at the sheared right wing tip. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the left tip tank contained 4.5 gallons of fuel, about 1/4 of its 17-gallon capacity. (The pilot stated in a postaccident interview that the left tip tank contained 1/2 to 3/4 of its total capacity.) The left main tank contained about 0.6 gallons of fuel. The right main tank did not contain any fuel; however, the fuel drain for that tank was separated from the tank during impact. No fuel was observed leaking from the right main tank, nor was there an odor of leaking fuel. The right tip tank was destroyed by impact damage and the subsequent fire. The cockpit fuel selector was found positioned on the left tip tank. During a postaccident interview with a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the pilot stated that, after the loss of engine power, he reached for the fuel selector but was unsure of what he did because his attention was diverted by the stall warning light. An operational engine test run revealed no anomalies. The pilot stated that he believed the loss of engine power during initial climb was likely due to fuel starvation, as a result of fuel sloshing in the left tip tank during rotation and initial climb. However, calculations, testing, and operational history showed that the left tip tank would not unport and experience fuel starvation leading to loss of engine power if it contained 4.5 gallons of fuel unless maneuvering during a turning takeoff was extreme. The accident airplane did not experience extreme maneuvers during or immediately after takeoff. Global positioning system (GPS) data downloaded from the pilot's handheld receiver showed that ground maneuvering for the accident takeoff was routine and did not achieve the lateral accelerations necessary to disrupt fuel flow from the left tip tank. Thus, a takeoff using the left tip tank containing 4.5 gallons of fuel would not result in fuel starvation and, ultimately, loss of engine power.Additional testing showed that if a fuel tank was depleted of its useable fuel, the engine would continue to run at takeoff power for an additional 35 to 40 seconds. GPS data for the accident flight showed that the loss of engine power likely occurred 22 to 27 seconds after the takeoff roll was initiated. A takeoff on an empty or nearly empty main tank could result in fuel starvation. The accident takeoff was likely performed on an empty or nearly empty main tank.",

Because the pilot believed he was using the fullest tank (the left tank), he elected to not switch tanks as stated in the emergency procedures. The pilot was unable to restart the engine and was forced to execute an off-airport emergency landing. Fuel calculations showed the airplane should have had approximately 29 minutes of fuel remaining. The right tank had ruptured during impact, and it had evidence of hydraulic actuation. The left tank was not ruptured, and it contained approximately 3 gallons of fuel, which was considered unusable by the airframe manufacturer. ",

There was still runway remaining, and the pilot made the decision to abort the takeoff. Because the airplane was at a very low altitude, the pilot was not sure that all three landing gear would fully extend before the airplane touched down. Therefore, he elected to keep the landing gear retracted, and the airplane touched down on the soft/rough terrain adjacent to the runway. Although no anomalies related to the engine were found, three pieces of poly-isoprene (synthetic rubber) were found in the fuel tank associated with the engine that lost power. Each individual piece was large enough to plug the orifice to the fuel boost pump, and it is likely that one or more of the pieces interrupted the fuel flow to the engine and resulted in the loss of power.",

Upon arriving over the airstrip, the pilot made a traffic pattern approach and observed that the wind was calm. The pilot stated that his airspeed and approach path were approximately normal and that he was familiar with the airstrip, having landed there in a southerly direction on previous days. The airplane touched down near the beginning of the short, 1,350-foot-long grass runway. The pilot further reported that he used light to firm brake pressure and that the airplane began sliding. He stated that the south portion of the runway (near its departure end) was soggy. He attempted a rapid left turn to avoid encountering the drop-off adjacent to the runway's end. As the airplane turned left, the right wing dipped down, impacted the ground, and broke. The Cessna Aircraft Company's \"Landing Distance Table\" in the U206 operating handbook provides guidelines for ascertaining the approximate landing distance needed under various conditions.

According to air traffic control records, after takeoff, the pilot handling radio communications requested maneuvering airspace for airwork in an altitude block of 13,000 to 15,000 feet mean sea level (msl). About 8 minutes later, the air traffic controller asked the pilot to state his heading, but he did not respond. A review of recorded radar data revealed that, about 14,000 msl and 3 miles southeast of the accident site, the airplane made two constant-altitude 360-degree turns and then proceeded on a north-northeasterly heading for about 2.5 miles. The airplane then abruptly turned right and lost altitude, which is consistent with a loss of airplane control. The airplane continued to rapidly descend until it impacted trees and terrain on a southerly heading. No discernible distress calls were noted.

Once in the grass, the airplane slid sideways to the right, then regained a more positive straight ahead tracking, encountered a 3 to 4 foot embankment and became airborne again for a very short period of time until airspeed dropped off.  The aircraft traveled horizontally for about 70 feet then vertically for 30 feet.  The aircraft hit the ground, bounced and slid into the airport security fence.

During this time we were in and out of rain showers and moderate turbulence.'  He said that during the approach, '...there was a strong wind from the west,' which gave him a higher ground speed, and he '...reached the MDA (minimum descent altitude) over the beginning of the runway.'  He started a missed approach and requested vectors for another approach.  The pilot said, '...when I was established on the approach, I got down to the MDA this time about 2.5 miles from the runway and saw the runway about 1 mile.  We descended to the runway and touched down at the 1,000 feet marker, so I knew that I had 4,000 feet of runway remaining.

I started pumping the brakes which seem to not make any difference, then I saw there was a big obstruction at the end of the runway (localizer antenna), and decided to go right of the obstruction.  On the grass I had a hard time to keep the aircraft straight and to keep it going in the direction I wanted...we hit something and fell down 25 feet and came to a full stop....'  During the post accident inspection of the aircraft evidence of hydroplaning was found on both main tires.'
