The pilot subsequently performed a forced landing; however, the airplane struck several trees about 1,000 feet short of an open field. Examination of the airframe revealed no deficiencies of the fuel or fuel system, and a test run of the engine showed that it was capable of producing power.

The wreckage was located in at a depth of 45 meters and at coordinates: North 59 degrees 32 minutes 546 seconds and East 24 degrees 43 minutes 852 seconds.  Weather in the area of the accident was covered by the north-east part of a low pressure front.  The winds were 110 degrees at 14 knots at the surface and at 1000 - 2000 feet the winds were at 130 degrees at 25 - 30 knots.  The lowest cloud base was at 800 - 1400 feet.  Temperature was 14 degrees Celsius and the dew point was 13 degrees Celsius.The accident helicopter departed from Tallinn City Hall heliport at about 12:39 local time for a scheduled flight to Helsinki, Finland.  The flight normally lasts 18 minutes and is about 80 kilometers in distance.  The accident flight crew had already performed 5 landings at Tallinn City Hall heliport that day.  The operator, at the time of the accident, operated 28 daily scheduled flights between Helsinki and Tallinn on weekdays.  Shortly after takeoff, the flight had reached an altitude of 1500 feet and the flight crew began a climb to 2000 feet.  The FDR data shows a change in collective position shortly before the helicopter pitches up abruptly and then rolls to the left.  Witnesses saw the helicopter crash and an air traffic controller observed the helicopter disappear from radar coverage.  As a result, a search and rescue operation was launched immediately.The accident investigation is being conducted by the Government of Estonia as the state of occurrence.  They have formed an Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission that is comprised of 8 individuals.  There are accredited representatives from Finland, the United States (US) and France.  The Safety Board sent an accredited representative and an airworthiness specialist to assist the Commission.  Sikorsky and the Federal Aviation Administration also sent technical advisors.  They were on-scene for over two weeks.  Wreckage examination revealed that the floats had not been deployed and that the main rotor and tail rotor blades were intact until water impact.  The engines were sent to the manufacturer in France for further examination.  The recorders were downloaded at the recorder manufacturer in the United Kingdom.  US manufactured parts that were part of the transmission and flight controls were sent to the US for examinations, testing and teardowns.

Failure of the mid span hinge pin allowed the control surface to buckle, which subsequently fractured the integral torque tube running along the leading edge of the elevator.  Flexing of the control surface permitted the outboard end of the torque tube to slide free of the outboard hinge support.  This allowed the elevator to separate from the airframe.  In addition, the torque tube cutout at the mid span hinge fitting appeared to be oversized from that shown in the aircraft construction plans.  The cutout of the torque tube at the mid span hinge support extended around approximately 120 degrees at the forward side of the tube.

He said it looked as if the pilot of the other airplane saw them about the same time, and thinks that both he and the other pilot immediately initiated right turns in an attempt to avoid each other. He said that as he initiated the right turn the other airplane appeared to effectively travel across his airplane's wind shield from right to left, remaining just above the glare shield covering his airplane's instrument panel. He said he then felt the impact of his airplane's left wing colliding with some portion of the other airplane, and his airplane \"tumbled\", and entered a spin to the left. During the spin, he said he saw another airplane about 250 to 300 feet below him, and it appeared to be inverted. The instructor on N6101F confirmed what the student stated and said that he immediately  took control of the airplane and made an emergency landing on a dirt road. The other airplane in the collision, N9840V, a Cessna 172M, impacted the ground at a near vertical angle, and was destroyed. Initial examination of  N9840V showed that the outboard portion of the right horizontal stabilizer/elevator segment, as well the vertical stabilizer/rudder assembly, had detached  from the empennage of N9840V.  In addition, examination N9840V's vertical stabilizer/rudder that had detached revealed a scrape/crease, stretching from the leading edge, aft through the length of the stabilizer/rudder assembly.

The missing left elevator counterweight/11- by 7.25-inch section  that had been missing from the aft portion of N9840V's elevator had penetrated the wing of N6101F, creating the gouge and wedging itself at station 172 in the wing of N6101F.

Six to eight ounces of hydraulic fluid was added to the reservoir.  After the hydraulic fluid was added, the landing gear was cycled 4 to 5 times, and the landing gear retracted and fully extended normally.

The flight was diverted as requested, and was cleared for a nonpercision instrument approach to a coastal airport adjacent to mountainous terrain.  The flight was authorized to a lower altitude when established on the approach. A review of the radar track information disclosed that the pilot did not fly the published approach, but abbreviated the approach and turned the wrong direction, toward higher terrain, north of the approach course.  The airplane was discovered in mountainous terrain, about 1,100 msl, and 1.5 miles north of the approach course.  The crash path was initially at a shallow angle in the treetops, until the airplane struck larger trees.  Postaccident inspection of the airplane disclosed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical problems, other than the baggage door, which was still attached to the airplane.",

The pilot called 'No control, MAYDAY,' on the radio.  The helicopter nosed down and impacted the water.  The aircraft was recovered, except for the aft portion of the tail rotor driveshaft and tailboom, including the tail rotor gearbox and all tail rotor system rotating components.  The wreckage was shipped to the United States for examination.  The aircraft had undergone a major overhaul/rebuild and annual inspection following a previous accident on March 11, 1997. After completing 1.4 hours of test flights, the helicopter was then partially disassembled and transported to California, and subsequently shipped to American Samoa.  Maintenance personnel in Hawaii reassembled the aircraft, after replacing several parts.  The owner of the maintenance facility stated some of the life-limited components were replaced with parts with less accrued total time.  He reported that they had to adjust the shim on the tail rotor driveshaft because it was 'way off, too tight.'  No test run was performed after reassembly.  Examination of the helicopter following recovery revealed the forward tail rotor driveshaft coupling evidenced a fracture and separation. The forward portion of the coupling remained attached at the main transmission output pinion, while the aft portion of the coupling remained attached to the forward end of the tail rotor driveshaft.  The coupling bolts evidenced smearing of the bolt heads.  Scanning electron microscopy revealed a total of eight fracture surfaces.  Six fracture surfaces displayed features consistent with fatigue, although much of the mechanical damage prevented identification of origin locations, and the other two fracture surfaces exhibited features consistent with overstress separation.  Further, the coupling is designed with a built-in fail-safe feature that will continue to provide torque transmission in the event that a flex frame leg or bolt fractured.  When the fail-safe engages, the unbalance of the coupling increases with a resultant increase in the vibration, alerting the pilot to take the appropriate action and land. ",

Further, no record was found that the pilot obtained a weather briefing before the flight. In addition, postaccident weight and balance calculations indicated that, when the airplane took off, it exceeded the allowable weight and center of gravity limits. Another pilot at the airport advised the accident pilot to file a flight plan, recalculate the weight and balance, and obtain a weather briefing; however, no evidence indicates that the pilot did so.Although visual meteorological conditions were recorded at RDU for the expected time of arrival, snow was forecast and instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) were observed for en route areas between 3CK and RDU for the time before, during, and after the flight. The noninstrument rated pilot exercised poor judgment by attempting a visual flight rules cross country flight, over mountainous terrain, without getting adequate weather information for the flight route, especially in January when snowy conditions are likely.The accident occurred near Huntington Tri-State Airport (HTS), Huntington, West Virginia, which was about 350 nautical miles (nm) from 3CK and 10 nm southwest of the direct flight route between 3CK and RDU. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar data first recorded the airplane about 1244 central standard time at an altitude of about 9,700 feet about 50 nm southwest of HTS and then showed the airplane turning northeast toward HTS. According to FAA air traffic control (ATC) transcripts, about 1305, the pilot transmitted a \u201cmayday\u201d call to the HTS ATC tower and then advised, \u201cI\u2019m flying VFR [visual flight rules], low on fuel, and need to land.\u201d Subsequently, the local controller asked the pilot if he was capable of instrument flight, and the pilot responded, \u201cyes,\u201d even though he was not instrument rated. (The airplane was equipped for instrument flight, and no evidence indicated that an instrument malfunction occurred.) About 8 minutes later, the controller asked the pilot how much fuel was on board, and he answered, \u201cnot much.\u201d For about 10 minutes, the controller attempted to vector the airplane to HTS. Although the pilot stated several times that he had visual ground contact, he was not able to maintain it, and he never acknowledged that he had the airport in sight. After about 12 minutes of providing detailed course headings and corrections to the pilot, the final approach controller was able to vector the airplane onto an extended final course for an airport surveillance radar approach to runway 30 at HTS. However, when the airplane was about 3 nm from the runway, it turned about 80 degrees off course to the left. The controller vectored the airplane back to the right, and the airplane turned so far to the right that it proceeded directly opposite the original inbound course. Additionally, the airplane descended below the minimum descent altitude, which the controller issued to the pilot, and which the pilot acknowledged, multiple times. Weather conditions recorded at HTS, which was about 4 nm northwest of the accident site, included an overcast ceiling at 1,000 feet and a visibility of 3/4 statute mile in snow. Witnesses at the airport and in the vicinity of the crash site described the snowfall at the time of the accident as \u201cheavy\u201d and estimated the visibility to be between 1/4 and 3/4 mile. The pilot did not request any in-flight weather assistance nor did he seek any ATC assistance before the situation had deteriorated. After the pilot contacted ATC, his communications became fragmented and intermittent, consistent with increased workload resulting from efforts to control the airplane in IMC. Although ATC attempted to guide the pilot to a landing at HTS using an airport radar surveillance approach, these efforts were not effective as evidenced by radar data showing that the pilot could not maintain assigned altitudes or headings, indicating that he was most likely experiencing spatial disorientation during the attempt to maneuver the airplane for landing. The spatial disorientation was likely caused by his operating in reduced visual conditions (clouds and falling snow), which obscured outside references, and his inability to consistently use the airplane\u2019s instruments to positively maneuver the airplane when this occurred.",
            "probable_cause": "(1) The pilot\u2019s failure to perform adequate preflight planning and to use available in flight resources in a timely manner and (2) his decision to continue visual-flight-rules flight in instrument meteorological conditions despite his lack of an instrument rating and proficiency in instrument flying, which resulted in spatial disorientation and impact with terrain."

The first pilot obtained a computer science corporation (CSC) direct user access terminal service (DUATS) weather briefing and filed an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The instructor-pilot was listed as the pilot-in-command. The airplane took off and proceeded to its designated practice area.

The airplane departed Spruce Creek Airport (7FL6), Daytona Beach, Florida, about 0920, and was destined for Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport (MFD), Mansfield, Ohio. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.Preliminary radar and air traffic control information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that at 1214:05, the airplane was in cruise flight at an altitude about 9,000 feet when the pilot contacted Tri-Cities Approach Control. The air traffic controller acknowledged the pilot and issued the altimeter setting. At 1220:02, the controller asked the pilot his on-course heading; the pilot responded 356 degrees. The controller advised the pilot of scattered areas of unspecified weather of unknown intensity about 40 miles directly ahead of the airplane. The pilot stated he would like to deviate east if possible. The TRI air traffic controller approved deviations left and right as necessary, and instructed the pilot to maintain 9,000 feet.

His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued July 2, 2013. A review of the pilot's logbook revealed he had accumulated 2,852.3 total hours of flight experience, 167 hours of which were in the accident airplane make and model.According to FAA records, the airplane was manufactured in 1965, and was equipped with two Continental Motors Inc IO-470, 260 hp reciprocating engines. The airplane's maintenance records were not recovered; however, a maintenance invoice revealed that its most recent annual inspection was completed August 15, 2014, at 4094.9 total aircraft hours.The wreckage was examined at the accident site and all major components were accounted for at the scene. The initial impact points were an approximate 50-foot-tall tree and a deep ground scar collocated near the peak of a mountain, at an elevation of about 4,400 feet. . The airplane fragmented outside the crater, and was contained in an arc that reached about 50 feet beyond the crater on an approximate 192 degree magnetic heading, and widened to about 60 feet at its widest point.Control continuity could not be established due to extensive impact damage, however; parts associated with both wings, left and right wing flaps, and left and right ailerons were identified. Sheet metal and cabling associated with the horizontal and vertical stablizers, as well as the elevators, were also identified.The propellers were separated from their respective engines, and all propeller blades exhibited similar twisting, bending, leading edge gouging, and chordwise scratching. One tree trunk displayed deep, angular cuts with paint transfers consistent with propeller contact.The wreckage and some personal electronic devices were recovered for examination at a later date.",

N82735 was operated by the State of Alaska Department of Public Safety, Alaska State Troopers, Anchorage, Alaska as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country public-use flight, under the provisions of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91, when the accident occurred. N78NR was registered to and operated by the pilot as a VFR cross-country flight under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91. The sole occupants of the airplanes, both certificated commercial pilots, sustained serious injuries. After the collision, both aircraft descended uncontrolled into an area of densely populated birch and spruce trees and sustained substantial damage. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area at the time of the accident. N82735 departed Wasilla Airport about 1300 bound for Beluga, Alaska, and company flight following procedures were in effect. N78NR departed Birchwood Airport, Chugiak, Alaska at an unknown time destined for an off-airport landing site near Johnson Creek with no flight plan on file.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), along with three other NTSB investigators, a Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector from the Anchorage Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), and the Alaska State Troopers reached the accident sites on the afternoon of January 31. Both airplanes came to rest in an area of densely populated spruce and birch trees. N78NR impacted in a near vertical attitude, coming to rest inverted, at an elevation of approximately 355 feet mean sea level (MSL), on a heading of about 240 degrees. The inboard portion of its severed right wing was located about 97 feet from the main wreckage site. The outboard portion of the severed right wing was located at the main wreckage site of N82735, underneath and intertwined with its severed left wing. The right forward wing strut of N78NR was separated approximately 9 inches from its wing attach point, and a portion of the right forward wing strut was found in the debris field. The separations were flat angular fractures, with red paint transfer. Control continuity could not be established due to numerous fractures in the system but all fractures exhibited features consistent with overload. The accident site for N82735 was located approximately 1,125 feet southwest of N78NR. The airplane came to rest on its left side at an elevation of about 335 MSL, on a heading of approximately 225 degrees. Two large birch trees penetrated the cockpit, and pieces of the pilots fractured flight helmet were found near the base of the trees. All the primary flight control surfaces were identified at the accident site, and flight control continuity was verified from all of the primary flight control surfaces to the cockpit.During on-scene interviews with the NTSB IIC on February 1, witnesses consistently reported that they observed one Piper PA-18 traveling in a southwesterly heading, and the other Piper PA-18 traveling in a northwesterly direction. One witness on the ground observed both airplanes converge at approximately a 90 degree, right angle. The witness said that as both airplanes converged, neither airplane changed altitude or direction as they approached each other, and the two subsequently collided.During an interview with NTSB IIC on February 1, a pilot-rated witness that was standing on the east end of South Hollywood Airport, who observed the airplanes just after the collision, stated that he recognized the Alaska State Trooper airplane. He said that after the collision the state trooper's airplane entered a spin, and it began a nose low, spiraling descent. As the airplane reached approximately 400 feet above ground level, the airplane recovered from the spin, briefly leveled off, this was followed by an increase in engine noise. The nose of the airplane then pitched abruptly down, and then the engine noise decreased, which was followed by the sound of the airplane impacting the tree-covered terrain. He said that after the midair collision, the other Piper PA-18 appeared to snap roll to the right as the airplane traveled away from his location. He then observed a large portion of that airplane's right wing flutter to the ground, as it entered a near vertical, uncontrolled, spiraling descent.During a hospital room interview with the NTSB IIC on February 2, the Alaska state trooper pilot of N82735 stated that after departure from the Wasilla Airport, he climbed the airplane to approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet MSL, and configured the airplane for cruise flight. While in level cruise flight, traveling in a southwesterly heading, with the sun at his 1130 to 1200 o'clock position, he saw a momentary flash in the upper left corner of his windscreen, which was instantaneously followed by the collision. After the collision his airplane entered an uncontrollable dive, with no elevator control. In a final effort to regain control, he pushed the control stick forward, and he was able to regain limited elevator authority, but the airplane continued to descend, nose low, into the tree-covered terrain. The last thing the trooper pilot remembered was entering the trees. The closest weather reporting facility is Wasilla Airport, about 5 miles northeast of the accident sites. At 1256, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) at Wasilla, Alaska, reported: wind, 250 at 4 knots; visibility, 10 statute miles; sky condition, clear; temperature, 12 degrees F; dew point 1 degrees F; altimeter, 30.37 inHG.",

The screens in the two fuel pick-up ports in the left fuel tank were completely blocked with debris.  No other anomalies with the airplane were found.  Later examination of the fuel pick-up fittings and finger screens revealed the debris to be hardened mud and mulch similar to that found in nests made by wasps. The airplane underwent an annual inspection 6 days before the accident.  The airplane was flown to American Champion, Rochester, Wisconsin, to have new wings installed 3 days before the accident.  Annual inspection criteria calls for the finger strainers in the pick-up fittings to be pulled and inspected for screen damage and debris.  At the factory, the fuel pick-up fittings were determined serviceable and re-installed in the new wings' fuel tanks.

According to radar data and data from an on-board handheld GPS receiver, during the initial climb, the airplane turned right to proceed on course to its destination but shortly thereafter entered a descending left turn that exhibited significant descent and heading change rates and varying groundspeeds. The airplane subsequently impacted trees about 560 feet from the airplane's final recorded position, leaving a debris path roughly consistent in direction and velocity with the airplane's last known track. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures. Although avian remains were recovered from the runway the airplane departed from, no evidence of a bird strike could be found anywhere on the airframe. The flight took place in the dark night, with no visible lunar illumination and no reports of any obscuring meteorological phenomena in the area, although rising wooded terrain with relatively little ground lighting was present ahead of the airplane before it entered the descending left turn. Both pilots held pilot certificates and ratings that would have allowed either of them to act as pilot-in-command of the flight, and both were found seated in front of a fully functional set of flight controls.

Six minutes after parking the first airplane, she switched to the accident airplane, and departed on a round-robin flight that included 4 takeoffs and 3 landings. About 8 minutes after the last takeoff, she declared an emergency, and reported a loss of engine power. Ground witnesses, and the front seat passenger, heard the engine stop, restart for a moment, and stop again. The pilot made an emergency landing approach to a remote island beach. While maneuvering for landing, she banked sharply to the right, and the airplane stalled at low level, colliding with the ground in a right wing and nose low attitude. Examination of the airplane at the crash site by an FAA inspector revealed that the fuel selector was on the left fuel tank. The right wing fuel tank system appeared to have been breached. The left fuel tank system appeared to be intact, and contained about 1/2 gallon of fuel. The engine fuel manifold contained about a drop of fuel. The engine was placed on an engine test stand, where it produced full rated rpm. The accident airplane had been flown the previous day by another company pilot for about 72 to 90 minutes and then parked. The amount of fuel remaining in the airplane when it was parked is unknown. A company ramp employee said he saw the pilot with a fuel hose at the accident airplane, but the amount of fuel, if any, that the pilot put in the airplane is unknown. Also, that observation was 23 minutes before the pilot's time sheet indicated she landed in the first airplane. Consequently, the amount of fuel in the accident airplane when the pilot departed is unknown.  The pilot flew the accident airplane about 41 minutes before her crash landing on the beach. The company does not require pilots to log the amount of fuel placed in each airplane before each flight. The airplane's owner's manual description of the procedure for engine restart, after running a fuel tank dry, states, in part: \"To ensure a prompt engine restart in flight after running a fuel tank dry, switch to the tank containing fuel, and place the auxiliary fuel pump switch in the \"HI\" position momentarily (3 to 5 seconds) with the throttle at least 1/2 open. Excessive use of the \"HI\" position of the auxiliary pump can cause flooding of the engine as indicated by a short (1 to 2 second) period of power, followed by a loss of power. This can be detected by a fuel flow indication, accompanied by a lack of power. If flooding does occur, turn off the auxiliary fuel pump switch, and normal propeller windmilling should start the engine in 1 to 2 seconds.\"  Due to the lack of fuel found in the left wing tank, the position of the fuel selector, and the absence of any mechanical problems with the engine, it is probable that the pilot inadvertently allowed the left tank to run dry, and was unable to restart the engine prior to the emergency landing.  During the emergency landing, she allowed the airspeed to decay and stalled the airplane, adding to the severity of the crash.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power due to fuel starvation from the pilot's improper fuel selector positioning, and her failure to maintain adequate airspeed to preclude a stall. Contributing to the accident was an inadvertent stall."

The witnesses also described smooth and continuous engine operation to ground impact. No evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures were discovered during a postaccident examination of the wreckage. Postmortem toxicological testing of the pilot was positive for ethanol, a prescription opioid narcotic known to impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, and a prescription antidepressant. While some of the ethanol detected in the testing may have been produced postmortem, the measured serotonin metabolite ratio implied alcohol consumption by the pilot in the 16 hours prior to the accident flight. Given the pilot's long-term, chronic narcotic use, he may have developed some tolerance to the sedating, mental, and physical effects associated with the detected quantity of the drug. Although the investigation was unable to determine the degree of the pilot\u2019s impairment, since the concentrations of the prescription opioid narcotic detected were well above a normal therapeutic range, it is likely that the pilot was impaired.

The pilot added that he pumped the brake handle a few more times in an attempt to stop, but without success. The pilot further stated that he elected not to abort the landing, because he was too far down the runway and too close to the 25 foot trees, obstructing the departure end of the runway.

The pilots continued to hear pops, rips, and tearing as the balloon descended to approximately 9,000 feet msl.  Eighteen propane bottles and three oxygen bottles surrounded the gondola.  The ground crew reported surface winds of 30 to 35 knots, and the surface terrain was rugged with canyons and rock formations.  The crew decided that a safe heavy weight standup landing would not be possible, and they parachuted to the ground.  The unmanned balloon continued flight for 7 hours and 375 nm until it impacted wires and was consumed by postimpact fire.

After the airplane took off, it departed the airport traffic pattern for in-flight tests. About 11 minutes later, the airplane reentered the airport traffic pattern and completed a left, overhead, mid-field break about 600 feet above ground level (agl). A voice recognized as the pilot/mechanic's then advised the tower that the three landing gear were down and locked, and the airplane arrived at the abeam position about 500 feet agl and 215 knots. The airplane then eased out of the turn and briefly flew a straight course that angled toward the runway before commencing a sharp turn toward the runway with an observed 90-degree angle of bank. The airplane was then seen descending rapidly before pitching up, overshooting the extended runway centerline, nosing down, and impacting the ground. Both pilots were ejected when the airplane impacted the ground, and neither of the destroyed cockpits nor an airport security video could provide definitive evidence as to which pilot was in which seat.  However, because the pilot/mechanic\u2019s voice was on all radio transmissions, including a transmission that he was unfamiliar with the airport, it is likely that he was in the front seat and flying the airplane.Wreckage examination revealed that the airplane had impacted the ground in an approximately  45-degree left angle of bank, about 5 degrees nose-low. The landing gear were down and the push button selectors were in the \"normal\" position, indicating that landing gear were extended normally. The two left-wing flap segments were separated from the extensively damaged wing, and the differing cockpit wing flap indicators were unreliable due to cockpit and airplane damage. However, the two relatively intact right-wing flap segments were up and flush with the wing, consistent with the flaps being up at impact. The emergency airbrake selector was in the \"out\" position, indicating that the pilot/mechanic had recognized a loss of hydraulic pressure after lowering the landing gear, but before he could effectively deploy airbrakes or flaps. There are no means to lower flaps following a loss of hydraulic pressure. The pilot/mechanic should have extended the downwind leg for a flaps-up approach, per the abnormal procedures. However, he continued the high angle-of-bank, as-configured approach, but did not maintain sufficient airspeed to preclude an \"accelerated maneuver stall.\"",

The VFR cross-country flight was planned over mountainous terrain. The pilot obtained a weather briefing that included information about icing conditions along the planned route. During the flight, no communication was received from the pilot other than activation of his flight plan after departing the airport. The airplane was reported overdue, but a search was hampered due to IFR conditions and snow. No transponder code was issued to the airplane, and no discrete radar data was located in stored radar data to assist in locating the airplane. By 0900 on 4/15/95, analysis of the primary target radar returns helped in locating the accident airplane. Also, only an intermittent signal was transmitted from the airplane's emergency locator transmitter (ELT). The wreckage was located 3 days later, where the airplane had crash landed on snow covered mountainous terrain. Investigation revealed the pilot initially survived the accident, but succumbed to hypothermia. He was wearing a flight suit over dress clothes, a flight jacket, and dress shoes. No survival equipment was required to be carried in the airplane. The pilot had a personal survival kit, but had left it in his vehicle at the departure airport. A note found in the wreckage indicated that the engine lost power. After recovery, the engine operated normally. The transponder switch was found in the \"standby\" position; inspection of the ELT revealed a faulty tuning crystal. The pilot had received training in survival skills and was a CAP survival skills instructor. ",

The weather conditions included a visibility of less than 1/4-mile in fog, with a vertical visibility of 100 feet.  The pilot stated he was able to see the field while intercepting the instrument approach course at 3,000 feet msl.  Using instruments for the approach, he was still able to maintain visual contact through the 100- to 200-foot-thick layer of fog, when he reached 200 feet agl.  After descending, he lost visual contact with the runway, and everything became black.  He started to move the levers up for a go-around, but noticed two red lights to his left.  He thought he was too close to the ground and too slow, so he decided to land.  The airplane touched down on the runway a second or two later.  The pilot did not maintain directional control and the airplane veered to the left.  It crossed an unpaved area, then hit and crossed a taxiway.  The pavement lip edge broke the nose wheel off.  The airplane continued onto another unpaved area and came to rest.  It was about 50 feet to the left of runway 28R, and about 100 feet to the right of runway 5.  The airplane also incurred damage to the nose gear fork assembly, pressure vessel, and to frame members.

The airplane reached an altitude of approximately 91 feet above ground level and then entered an uncontrolled descent consistent with the onset of a velocity minimum control (Vmc) roll to the right. No evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions with either the engine or airframe was discovered, and evidence at the scene indicated that the landing gear had been retracted and the right engine propeller feathered. Examination of the cockpit revealed the right engine fuel selector was positioned between the \"60 GAL RIGHT AUX\" detent and the \"RIGHT ENG OFF\" detent. Examination of the fuel system between the selector and the right engine indicated that it was in this position prior to impact. Also, placards next to the fuel selectors stated, \"WARNING POSITION SELECTORS IN DETENTS ONLY. NO FUEL FLOW TO ENGINES BETWEEN DETENTS.\" The pilot loaded the majority of the cargo and performed the weight and balance calculations. Examination of the fuselage revealed that all six cargo bins were full. The investigation also discovered that the furthest aft bin contained 265 pounds of cargo even though placarded for a maximum of 75 pounds. All other bins were loaded considerably below their maximum weight limits. Weight and balance calculations revealed the information listed on the weight and balance form produced by the pilot was erroneous and that the actual center of gravity (CG) of the airplane was rear of the aft CG limit, which would have created instability in the handling characteristics of the airplane, especially after a loss of engine power. In addition, the aft-of-limit CG would have increased the airspeed needed to prevent the airplane from entering a Vmc roll. Performance calculations indicate that with the right engine having lost power immediately after takeoff, the airplane would most likely not have been able to continue the departure on one operating engine.",

The first officer used the spoilers while on the left base leg and then maneuvered the airplane in an \u201cS-turn\u201d on the final leg to correct for a too-steep approach. Just as the airplane was about to touch down with the airspeed decreasing, the captain made several calls for \u201cpower\u201d and then called for a \u201cgo around.\u201d However, the first officer did not add power for a go-around, and the captain did not take control of the airplane. Both pilots reported that, when the airplane was about 30 ft above ground level (agl), they felt a sensation that the airplane had \u201cstopped flying\u201d with a simultaneous left roll, which is indicative of an aerodynamic stall, followed by an immediate impact with terrain. After striking obstructions that completely separated the right main landing gear and the right flap, the airplane came to rest upright in the dirt on the side of the runway about 4,000 ft from the initial impact point. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. All eight occupants evacuated through the main cabin door. There was a substantial fuel spill but no postimpact fire. Both pilots reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane, and neither pilot reported an uncommanded loss of engine power.\u000b\u000bData from the enhanced ground proximity warning system showed that seven warning events occurred in the last 3 minutes before the accident. The first warning was for \u201csink rate,\u201d and it occurred when the airplane was about 1,317 ft agl and in a 3,400-ft-per-minute descent. The last warning was for \u201cbank angle,\u201d and it occurred about 10 seconds before touchdown as the airplane exceeded 42 degrees of bank when it was about 200 ft agl. The wind recorded at the airport at the time of the accident would have resulted in a 12-knot variable tailwind with gusts to 18 knots. \u000b\u000bThe evidence is consistent with the first officer flying a nonstabilized approach with a decreasing airspeed during low-level windshear conditions. The first officer did not properly compensate for the known low-level windshear conditions and allowed the airspeed to continue to decrease and the bank angle to increase until the airplane experienced an aerodynamic stall.",

The pilot then set the mixture control to full rich and leveled the airplane. When attempts to retract the landing gear were unsuccessful, the pilot elected to make an emergency landing on an interstate highway. During the landing the airplane\u2019s left wing impacted the left side of a tractor-trailer truck, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane. The engine was test run 3 separate times during a post accident examination and no anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane was equipped with a landing gear back-up actuator override mechanism, which prevents landing gear retraction at airspeeds below approximately 85 miles per hour (mph); this airspeed increases with power reduction and/or altitude increase. Density altitude at the time of the accident was calculated to be 6,946 feet, which according to Piper Aircraft, would have required an additional 6 miles per hour to be added to the 85 mph to affect a normal gear retraction. The system incorporates a manual override emergency gear lever that in the raised position allows the landing gear position to be controlled by the landing gear selector switch regardless of airspeed and power combinations. A post accident examination of the override system revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. When asked if he had used the system prior to the emergency landing, the pilot said he had not. The pilot\u2019s failure to attain and maintain an airspeed sufficient to affect a normal landing gear retraction, as well as his failure to utilize the airplane\u2019s emergency landing gear override system, collectively contributed to his decision to make an emergency landing. The pilot\u2019s perceived loss of engine power was most probably due to the degraded engine performance as a direct result of positioning the mixture control from an optimal lean position to the full rich position in a high density altitude environment. The pilot could have mitigated the event had he elected to initially use the manual override system, which would have resulted in a normal gear retraction regardless of airspeed and altitude.",
