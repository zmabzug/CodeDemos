He stated that the engine was still running, but it was not producing power. The pilot pushed the power lever forward; the engine power did not increase, but the engine temperature increased. He stated that the engine was idling fast and that he forced the airplane into a bean field about 150 to 200 yards ahead of a tree line. The pilot ground looped the airplane before contacting the trees. A postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies. A bench test of the propeller governor revealed that the maximum speed was above the nominal limit and the minimum speed was below the nominal limit. The control lever position was set higher than the specified position, which indicated that the governor had been adjusted in an attempt to regulate the propeller speed.  X-rays and a teardown revealed that the propeller governor speeder spring was fractured. A metallurgical examination revealed a preexisting fatigue crack that, over time, resulted in the failure of the spring. The failed speeder spring would have resulted in a loss of oil pressure to the propeller piston, which allowed the propeller blades to rotate to a high blade angle, which then decreased the engine speed and overall power output of the engine. Maintenance records showed the propeller governor was overhauled on May 19, 2009. The speeder springs did not have serial numbers, and, therefore, the maintenance history of the speeder spring could not be determined.",

He felt a shake or vibration through the controls and looked for a place to land. He was maneuvering the helicopter towards a road when the helicopter experienced a full left yaw. The pilot applied full right pedal to counter the yawing motion and entered autorotation through the trees to the ground. Subsequently the pilot revised his statement saying that the skids of his helicopter were at least 10-15 feet above the tallest tree when he felt a shake or vibration through the controls. Postaccident examination of the airplane by a mechanic and a FAA inspector found continuity between the tail rotor and the linkages through the drive train which lead to the main transmission. Control system continuity was also established. The tail boom near the tail rotor transmission was twisted clockwise, shearing the aluminum, which is consistent with a tail rotor imbalance condition.

After departure, the pilot made a 6-nautical-mile flight to another airport, at which point, he decided to perform several practice touch-and-go landings. Following a smooth landing, he configured the airplane for takeoff by confirming the fuel selector was positioned to both wing tanks and then applied full power. The airplane climbed to about 150 feet above ground level, and, then the engine suddenly experienced a total loss of power. The pilot could not restart the engine, and the airplane touched down in a muddy field and came to rest inverted.The airplane\u2019s fuel selector handle was designed to be affixed to its shaft via a spring pin that slides through a hole on the handle and shaft only when the handle is properly aligned with the shaft; the spring pin prevents the handle from being installed incorrectly. A postaccident examination revealed that the fuel selector handle had been installed 180 degrees out of alignment, which was only possible because the spring pin attaching the handle to the shaft had been modified. Disassembly of the fuel valve also revealed excessive wear to the internal mechanism. The mechanic who conducted the airplane\u2019s annual inspection reported that he had taken off the fuel selector handle to remove the panel and check for leaks. He checked the \u201coff\u201d position when receiving the airplane, but he did not check it after finishing the annual inspection. During postaccident examinations, the fuel flowed freely through the valve when the fuel selector handle was near the \u201coff\u201d position, and the fuel stopped flowing when the handle was in the \u201cboth\u201d position consistent with the handle indicating an opposite selection. Although one of the magnetos had worn beyond service limits and was not producing an adequate spark, its failure was unlikely related to the total loss of engine power. It is likely that the mechanic improperly installed the fuel selector handle after taking it off during the annual inspection, which was only possible due to the incorrectly modified fuel selector handle assembly.",

The Captain declared an emergency, shutdown the No. 1 engine, and a turnback to ATL was initiated. The airplane made a successful overweight, single-engine landing, and an emergency evacuation was conducted on the right side of the airplane onto the runway. Of the 172 passengers and 6 crewmembers on board the flight, 3 passengers received minor injuries associated with the slide evacuation. The airplane was operated by Delta Airlines as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 domestic passenger flight from ATL to Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. Examination of the engine found extensive fire damage and thermal distress in the fan and core compartments with the vast majority of the thermal distress and the most extensive fire damage located in the fan compartment between and including the intermediate case and the turbine exhaust case. The end housing of the fuel flow transmitter (FFT) was found backed-off from the main housing, which created a gap of about 0.3 inch at the bottom of the unit; correspondingly the FFT-to-fuel distribution valve (FFT-to-FDV) fuel line was found plastically deformed. An installation fit check coupled a deflection analysis of the FFT-to-FDV fuel line revealed that the deformation of the fuel tube was as a result of the FFT end housing separation; it did not cause the gap. Metallurgical analysis of the FFT hardware did not find any material defects or anomalies. Torque tension tests and a finite element analysis of the loads applied to the FFT revealed that under certain assembly variances and operational load and temperature variations, the load capability of the end housing-to-main housing bolted joint was marginal or less than marginal. With reduced load capability, the main housing threads would not be able to maintain the preload without eventually yielding, which would result in lessening of the preload and loosening of the joint. A review of the FFT component maintenance manual (CMM) found several areas where improvements could be made to ensure a more consistent FFT assembly practice and proposed changes have been initiated to the CMM.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

Microscopic examination revealed that the fractures on both pieces of the inner fork leaf were due to fatigue that initiated at multiple origins. Collectively, the fatigue cracks went through the thickness of the fork leaf. The large number of fatigue cracks was consistent with the nose gear fork assembly deteriorating for an extended period of time. The cracks were of a size that could be identified by visual examination. The nosegear strut exhibited slant fractures consistent with overstress. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed about 3 months, and 38 hours of operation, prior to the accident.",

However, the flight crew stated that before departure, they looked at a computerized weather display and observed a line of adverse weather conditions along their intended route of flight. During initial climb after takeoff, the flight crew noticed that they were approaching a line of thunderstorms. The captain initially planned to fly around this line but noticed a 10-mile gap in the line that was depicted on the airplane's on-board weather radar display. The captain decided to fly through the gap, which he could also see when he looked outside of the airplane. The first officer did not challenge his decision. Both flight crewmembers stated that the weather radar was functioning normally. It is unknown exactly what was depicted on the aircraft radar. Radar and weather data indicate that the airplane penetrated an extreme weather echo (VIP level 6) that likely contained a severe thunderstorm, hail, and severe to extreme turbulence. The thunderstorm top was above 45,000 feet. Neither the flight attendants nor the passengers received an adequate or timely briefing to remain seated and to prepare for the possibility of turbulence. The aft flight attendant and a passenger were seriously injured during the turbulence encounter. Hail shattered the front windshield and damaged the pitot system, radome, wings, tail, and engines. The flight crew successfully performed an emergency landing at a nearby airport. The investigation revealed that the captain had been involved in two other air carrier incidents involving adverse weather conditions. It also revealed that the airline lacked adequate training and guidance regarding hazardous weather interpretation and avoidance, as well as adequate procedures to notify flight attendants about potential turbulence. According to FAA guidance, flight crews should avoid intense or extreme level radar echoes by at least 20 miles. This guidance also instructs pilots that such echoes should be separated by at least 40 miles before flight is attempted between the echoes. ",

A friend of the pilot was at the airstrip and saw the accident airplane approach from the south, and then fly over the airstrip about 150 feet above ground level. The friend looked away, but reported that he was aware of the engine sounds, which were not unusual and did not draw his attention.  The friend heard a \"thud\" and the engine sounds stropped.  He looked up and saw the airplane cartwheel on the west side of a pinnacle, north of the airstrip.  The debris field was about 50 feet below the crest of the hill, and continued along a magnetic bearing of 045 degrees. Calculations indicated that the sun was 11 degrees above the horizon, and the magnetic bearing to the sun was 56 degrees. The pilot was turning into the sun, and the shadow side of the pinnacle just prior to impact. Glare from the sun likely affected his vision, and his ability to discern the terrain's proximity.

In the pilot's written statement he indicated that he had not briefed the forward right seat passenger to remain clear of all flight controls, and that he did not retract the right side rudder pedals. He surmised that the right seat passenger inadvertently applied pressure to the right toe brake. The pilot further stated that in the future he will incorporate that into his briefing (to remain clear of the flight controls), and to retract the right side rudder pedals. This event was upgraded to an accident on October 1, 2010, by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after an inspection discovered structural damage to the left landing gear attach box and the leading edge of the right horizontal stabilizer.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain directional control, likely due to the inadvertent control interference by a passenger. A finding in the accident was the pilot's improper pre flight briefing."

It then started an uncommanded turn to the right that the pilot could not arrest with left pedal input.  The pilot attempted to go around, but the helicopter kept rotating to the right, and the pilot's ability to reduce power was limited due to obstacles.  The pilot also attempted to \"weather vane\" the helicopter; however, it would not align with the wind, and the rate of rotation increased.  With the helicopter continuing to spin to the right, the pilot maneuvered it over the landing zone, closed the throttle, arrested the spin, and completed an autorotation.  A tail strike occurred during the landing flare.  According to the pilot's diagram of the accident scene, winds were about 50 degrees left of helicopter centerline during the approach.  Winds reported at area airports were approximately 90-100 degrees left of helicopter centerline during the approach, at 11 to 15 knots, gusting to 18 knots.

The controller asked the pilot's intentions, noting that there were two airports about 25 nautical miles from the airplane's position. The pilot stated that he would like to continue to one of the airports. The controller instructed the pilot to descend to 3,000 feet, and during the next 4 minutes, the pilot made multiple transmissions, including; that he thought he had lost a cylinder, that there was still fire coming off the nose of the airplane, they were getting smoke in the cockpit, and he may have to land on the highway. Approximately five minutes, 45 seconds after his first transmission, the pilot stated \"we're on fire.\" There were no further transmissions from the pilot.A witness subsequently observed the airplane on fire, in a 20-degree nose-down, 40-degree left bank before it impacted terrain.

About 8 miles east of the airport, the engine experienced a loss of power, and produced a puff of white-gray smoke combined with loud clanking sounds.  The airplane was at 1,200 feet, and the pilot directed the airplane towards an open field above a stretch of beach.  During the landing roll, the airplane came to the end of the field, nosed over the edge of a 50-foot cliff, and came to rest on the beach below.  The engine had been factory rebuilt in 2002, and had accumulated 1441.5 hours since the last major overhaul.  An examination of the engine revealed a 2.7-inch hole in the top of the engine case, shiny copper fragments from the number 2 main bearing in the oil sump, and one bearing fragment in the oil pickup screen.  Additionally, the bearing material of the number 2 main bearing had partially displaced itself and extruded between the crankshaft journal and the crankcase.  The bearing fragments were somewhat shiny or polished, indicating they received lubrication and were not exposed to extreme temperature. Numerous fragments from the number 2 main bearing were located in the oil sump.  The sizes of the fragments were generally too large to enter the oil sump pickup tube but could obstruct the pickup tube orifice, restricting the oil flow.  Engine oil analysis records indicate a sudden increased level of copper from 5.3 parts per million (ppm) to 61.2 ppm occurred sometime within the previous 63.1 hours of operation.  Engine journal bearing material is the only material within the engine that has a significant copper component.  This increase in copper levels is directly related to the gradual deformation and fragmentation of the number 2 main bearing.  The number 1 connecting rod had failed under overload that resulted from extreme temperatures at the connecting rod bearing that were consistent with oil starvation.  The number 1 connecting rod bearing receives oil pressure from the oil pump through the number 1 main bearing, and would be one of the first bearings to be effected by reduced oil flow.",

Subsequently, the airplane landed normally; however, during the landing roll, the nosewheel landing gear collapsed, and the airplane then came to rest nose low.\u000b\u000bPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the nosewheel landing gear pin was disengaged from the nosewheel jury strut, and the pin was not located. The disengagement of the pin allowed the nosewheel landing gear to collapse on landing. It could not be determined when or how the pin became disengaged from the jury strut. Installation of the pin would have required the first officer to maneuver in a small area and install the pin while the nose landing gear door was open and the gear extended. Further, the pin had a red flag attached to it. When inserted during flight, the flag encounters a high amount of airflow that causes it to vibrate; this could have resulted in the pin becoming disengaged after it was installed.\u000b\u000bEvidence of a hydraulic fluid leak was observed around the right engine cowling drain. The right engine hydraulic pump case was found cracked, and the backup ring was partially extruded, which is consistent with hydraulic system overpressurization. The reason for the overpressurization of the hydraulic system could not be determined during postaccident examination.\u000b",

A witness reported that it appeared the airplane was going to land; however, just before touchdown it began to ascend and enter a left turn. The witness said that shortly after entering the turn, the airplane's left wing buckled and folded back against the fuselage. The airplane then entered an uncontrolled descent to impact with the water. Visual examination of the fractured wing strut attachment fitting showed substantial corrosion and pitting throughout the assembly. Further examination utilizing a scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed that the left wing strut fitting fractured due to extensive corrosion followed by fatigue cracking. The lower side of the fitting had corrosion pitting that extended from the interior of the fitting completely through the thickness in some areas. The upper side of the fitting was also thinned due to corrosion. Several areas of the fracture surfaces showed oxidation consistent with progressive crack growth over an extended period of time, and fatigue features were found in areas not damaged by rubbing or corrosion. The most recent annual inspection was completed 2 months prior to the accident by the owner, who held an airframe and powerplant technician license. It was not determined which one of the two pilots, an airline transport pilot/certified flight instructor (also the owner of the airplane) seated in the left front seat or the airline transport pilot/certified flight instructor (CFI) seated in the right front seat, was manipulating the flight controls when the accident occurred.",

Wind velocity had increased, and several balloons were seen to go by at high speed and low altitude.  The pilot stayed low to keep right of the congested areas, but two of his passengers said they were flying too low.  The pilot became distracted when he saw another balloon hit a house.  The next thing he realized was that the wind had forced the balloon into power lines (the pilot told state troopers that he saw the power lines and activated the burners in an attempt to fly over them, but he told the FAA that he was on a landing approach and was in visual contact with the power line when he encountered a downdraft and was unable to clear the power lines).  The balloon's basket struck the top static line of a 3-phase high voltage transmission line.  The wind began to collapse the envelope and the pilot activated the burners in an attempt to maintain inflation and break loose from the power line.  The basket slid down the wire and the wire became entangled in the basket's skid plate.  The pilot threw a drop line to his chase crew in hopes they could pull him free.  This attempt failed.  The chase crew then attached the drop line to a pickup truck and tried to tow the balloon free.  This attempt also failed.  The braided static wire sawed through the wicker basket.  The balloon finally came loose from the power line and started to rise.

The pilot flew into the designated aerobatic box and performed an aerobatic sequence twice. The pilot then performed a spin maneuver and departed the aerobatic box. The witness recalled that the pilot was requested to repeat a maneuver and reentered the aerobatic box at an altitude between 2,700 and 3,000 feet above ground level (agl). The airplane entered a 30- to 35-degree nose-down descent angle to begin his sequence.

ZDV informed the pilot that Akron (AKO) was the closest airport and subsequently cleared the pilot to AKO.  On reporting having the airport in sight ZDV terminated radar service, told the pilot to change to the advisory frequency, and reminded him to close his flight plan.  Approximately 17 minutes later, ZDV contacted Denver FSS to inquire if the airplane had landed at AKO.  Flight Service had not heard from the pilot, and began a search.  Approximately 13 minutes later, the local sheriff found the airplane off of the airport.  Witnesses on the ground reported seeing the airplane flying westbound.  They then saw the airplane suddenly pitch nose down, \"spiral two times, and crash.\"  The airplane exploded on impact and was consumed by fire.  An examination of the airplane's left engine showed the number 2 and 3 rods were fractured at the journals.  The number 2 and 3 pistons were heavily spalded.  The engine case halves were fretted at the seam and through bolts.  All 6 cylinders showed fretting between the bases and the case at the connecting bolts.  The outside of the engine case showed heat and oil discoloration.  The airplane's right engine showed similar fretting at the case halves and cylinder bases, and evidence of oil seepage around the seals.  It also showed heat and oil discoloration.  An examination of the propellers showed that both propellers were at or near low pitch at the time of the accident.   The examination also showed evidence the right propeller was being operated under power at impact, and the left propeller was operating under conditions of low or no power at impact.  According to the propeller manufacturer, in a sudden engine seizure event, the propeller is below the propeller lock latch rpm.  In this situation, the propeller cannot be feathered.  Repair station records showed the airplane had been brought in several times for left engine oil leaks.  One record showed a 3/4 inch crack found at one of the case half bolts beneath the induction manifold, was repaired by retorquing the case halves and sealing the seam with an unapproved resin.  Records also showed the station washed the engine and cowling as the repair action for another oil leak.    ",

The pilot stated that \"downwind takeoff was the reason for accident.\"  He commented that the wind was \"25 to 30 [knots] with gusts.\"  The pilot stated that he had spoken to the operator's chief pilot the day before the accident \"about the poor choice of performing this charter with high winds 25, gusting to 30.\"  He further stated that on the morning of the accident he reiterated his concerns \"about the required downwind takeoff at the remote site\" to the company's operations manager. According to the operator, \"the downwind departure resulted in the helicopter settling with an uncontrolled nose rotation to the left.\"  The operator expressed the opinion that had the pilot performed a maximum performance confined area takeoff into the wind, the helicopter would have achieved effective translational lift to clear barriers without any incident or problems.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper decision to takeoff downwind in a confined landing zone, which resulted in a failure to attain translational lift and a loss of control."

Although family members and associates reported normal behavior that morning, witnesses stated that at the airport, he appeared pale, listless, and slightly confused as he attempted to remove his airplane from the hangar. Unable to muster the strength to move the airplane, he enlisted the help of an employee at the fixed base operator. Airport security video captured the airplane\u2019s ground roll and departure; the airplane took twice the normal distance to take off than was required; however, video and radar track data recorded a normal departure from the pattern.The airplane leveled off shortly after takeoff, and continued to fly at a constant airspeed and appropriate altitude for ground observation. Shortly thereafter, the airplane initiated a descent and made a left turn back toward the airport. The airplane continued to descend during the first portion of the return leg, and the pilot reported over the common traffic advisory frequency that he was experiencing \u201call kinds of trouble/problems in the cockpit\u201d and that he was returning to the airport. The airplane leveled off about 50 feet above ground level as it approached the traffic pattern. It subsequently struck a wooden communications pole 3 miles short of the runway and then collided with a highway embankment.A postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane was not configured for landing, and the cockpit controls were not set to any positions that would have indicated that an emergency situation existed.The pilot had successfully completed a flight review the day before the accident. The flight instructor, who performed the review, stated that the pilot had lost a considerable amount of weight within the last 30 days since he had last seen him and that, although he met the minimum acceptable standards, there was an appreciable degradation in his performance since his flight review the previous year. In particular, the pilot experienced difficulty applying sufficient brake pedal pressure and exhibited symptoms of mild confusion during the taxi and run-up.The pilot had been diagnosed with prostate cancer 5 years before the accident and non-insulin-dependent diabetes 2 years later.  In the few months before the accident flight, his cancer had grown and spread, and was unresponsive to treatment. He had not reported these diagnoses during his FAA medical examinations.Following the accident, the pilot was initially semi-conscious but in cardiac arrest by the time emergency medical personnel arrived. The autopsy concluded that he died from blunt force trauma but did not identify a traumatic injury which would have resulted in his cardiac arrest. The autopsy confirmed that his prostate cancer had in fact spread. Additionally, large quantities of fluid were removed from his chest cavity during the resuscitation attempt and the subsequent autopsy. The fluid buildup was most likely due to a preexisting condition related to his cancer, rather than from a traumatic injury. Laboratory analysis from the hospital also revealed that he had mild diabetic ketoacidosis.The cumulative effect of the pilot\u2019s medical conditions would have left him with decreased motor strength, shortness of breath, and declining cognitive function, which would have impaired his ability to cope with any urgent or emergent situations. This, and his advanced age, likely also contributed to his death from injuries that might otherwise have been survivable.",

THE PLT HAD THE ACFT FUEL TANKS 'TOPPED OFF' PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM KANSAS CITY. THE FLT PLAN INDICATED 3 HOURS 30 MIN ENROUTE TO ALBUQUERQUE WITH 5 HOURS 30 MIN OF FUEL ON BOARD. STRONG ENROUTE WINDS AND TURBULENCE WERE FORECAST ALONG THE ROUTE OF FLIGHT. THE ACTUAL FLIGHT WAS 4.4 HRS. THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED WHILE TURNING FROM BASE LEG TO FINAL AT THE ALBUQUERQUE INT'L ARPT. EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF FUEL IN OR AROUND THE AIRCRAFT. THE MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDS USING THE MAIN TANKS FOR 90 MINUTES BEFORE SWITCHING TO ANY AUX TANK TO PREVENT VENTING OF RETURN FUEL OVERBOARD. VENTED FUEL WILL DIMINISH FUEL SUPPLY. ",

His first approach was fast, the airplane bounced on touchdown, and he executed a go-around. On his second approach, the airplane drifted left and touched down left of the runway center line and bounced. Upon its second touchdown, the airplane swerved, and although the pilot attempted to regain control, it departed the left side of the runway and encountered a ditch.  The pilot stated that \"while current [he] did not have enough recent practice and should have refused PIC [pilot-in-command].\"",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll, which resulted in a ground loop/swerve.  A contributing factor was the pilot's lack of recent experience."

The pilot stated, that he made a right turn into the wind and that a gust of wind \"must have hit the tail causing him to lose tail-rotor authority.\"  The pilot further stated that he corrected with full left pedal; however, the helicopter touched down and the left skid dug into the soft ground causing the aircraft to roll onto the left side.  At the time of the accident, the wind was reported from 240 degrees at 4 knots, gusting to 12 knots.  The pilot reported having accumulated 70 hours in the same make and model.  He added that there were no anomalies with the helicopter prior to the accident.",
