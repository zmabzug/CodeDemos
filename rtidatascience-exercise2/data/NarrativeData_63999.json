Witnesses said the pilot arrived at the airport on Friday evening to pickup the accident airplane, which he had just purchased.  They said the pilot refused a checkout in the new airplane, and planned to depart after dark, in deteriorating weather conditions, for his home, stating he needed to be home before Monday.  Local pilots convinced him to delay his departure until the following morning.  The pilot declined a second offer of a checkout in the airplane the following morning.  A pilot-rated witness said he spoke with the pilot the morning he departed, while the pilot preflighted and fueled the accident airplane.  The witness said he checked local weather via a computer for the pilot.  He said weather to the east was not conducive to VFR flight, and he tried to convince the pilot to fly south to avoid the weather and rising terrain to the east.  According to the witness, the last thing the pilot asked before leaving was the identifier for an airport to the southeast, which he input into a handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit.  The witness said a direct route to that airport would not have taken the pilot far enough south to avoid the weather.  The witness said when the airplane departed about 0900, the ceiling was about 1,600 feet above ground level, and the visibility was 5 miles in rain.  The airplane wreckage was located east-southeast of the departure airport  along an approximate direct route to the airport the pilot entered into the GPS.

He said the airplane did not pass through brush and low trees located directly behind the wreckage.  Photographs taken at the accident site, showed uniform, sharp aft and upward crushing of the entire leading edge of both wings.  The empennage was crushed and folded downward, and twisted to the right, consistent with the airplane spinning at impact.

The flight was cleared for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09.  As part of the clearance, the controller assigned the flight an altitude of 1,800 feet to be maintained until established on the approach.  The pilot read back the altitude incorrectly as 1,200 feet, and the controller did not correct the error.  Radar service was terminated, and the pilot was cleared to change frequencies.  The pilot told the controller that he planned to make a full stop landing.  There were no further transmissions from the airplane.  According to the passenger, the flight instructor had taken control of the airplane \"due to the fact that the visibility was so poor.\"  The passenger stated that \"there was no visibility.\"  The last thing the passenger recalled prior to impact was that \"the VSI [vertical speed indicator] was dropping more than 500 ft per min.\"  Radar data showed the airplane tracking the ILS course.  The data showed the airplane crossing the outer marker at a mode C altitude of about 1,300 feet (corresponding to an altitude of 1,200 feet when corrected for local altimeter setting).  This was below the 1,800 foot glideslope intercept altitude at the outer marker shown on the approach plate.  The airplane remained at 1,300 feet for the next 49 seconds and then began to descend.  The last radar return was recorded 1 minute 27 seconds later and showed the airplane at a mode C altitude of 400 feet (300 feet when corrected for local altimeter setting), approximately 1/4 mile west of the accident site.  The accident occurred approximately 1/2 nautical mile west of the threshold of runway 09.  The airplane was approximately 300 feet left of the extended runway centerline when it initially struck trees and then power lines about 50 feet above the ground (agl).  The decision height for the approach was 223 feet msl, or 200 feet agl.  Reported weather conditions at the airport near the time of the accident were overcast ceiling at 100 feet, surface visibility 5 statute miles in mist, and surface wind from the west at 7 knots.  The ILS approach was flight checked by the FAA two days after the accident, and the localizer, glide slope, distance measuring equipment, locator outer marker, and middle marker all inspected satisfactory.   No evidence of any pre-impact mechanical discrepancies were found with the airframe, engine, avionics or instruments that would have prevented successful completion of the approach.",

Shortly after takeoff, the airplane lost engine power and impacted a lake.  Witnesses reported that the engine was sputtering, a momentary restart was performed, and a loss of engine power ensued while the airplane was maneuvering at an altitude of approximately 150-200 feet above ground level.  Both wings had leading edge crushing and vertical separation from the fuselage consistent with a low-speed shallow pitch impact attitude.   The propeller did not display signs of bending or twisting.  The flaps were in a retracted position, and cockpit switches were in positions contrary to that called for in the emergency landing procedures checklist for the airplane.   Examination of the engine ignition system revealed that the left magneto timing was approximately 30-35 degrees before top dead center, and the impulse coupling was unwound.  An annual inspection of the airplane was completed on the day of the accident.  Engine logbook records for the airplane shows an entry dated August 9, 2004, that states, \"changed left magneto with new magneto model number 4371.\"  There was no annotation as to the serial number of the left magneto, and no further entries within the engine logbook for overhaul of either magneto.

After departure, the pilot attempted to remain in visual flight rules (VFR) flight by climbing above 18,000 feet mean sea level and proceeding toward his destination. When queried by an air traffic controller, the pilot stated that he could not descend due to weather. In addition, he stated that he was not instrument rated or qualified.

Further, an examination of the wreckage revealed signatures on the airplane\u2019s right wing consistent with it failing in overload in the upward direction and signatures on the empennage and tail section consistent with their failure in overload in the downward direction, indicating the failures were due to loads that exceeded the airplane\u2019s structural limits. A weather study revealed the potential for clouds at the pilot\u2019s cruising altitude, which increased the potential for VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).

The PIC's first pass over the south end of Bainbridge Island was uneventful and the aircraft was maneuvered for a second pass. The PIC reported that approaching the upsloping, tree covered terrain he applied climb flaps and power but shortly thereafter realized the climb rate was less than he expected. He attempted a shallow left turn towards downsloping terrain and then leveled the wings as the aircraft descended into the treetops. The scenario was corroborated by two onboard video recordings. The pilot reported no powerplant or control system malfunction during the accident flight. He also reported encountering a downdraft condition over the tree covered terrain. Winds remained below 12 knots throughout the day at reporting stations near the accident site, and the video recordings showed no wind streaking and only sporadic whitecaps on the surface of Puget Sound during the transit from Seattle to the south end of Bainbridge Island.

He used slight banking to keep the airplane on runway centerline through touchdown, and differential braking and nosewheel steering to stay on runway centerline after touchdown. Shortly after exiting the runway, the rudder became free and moved normally. Examination of the rudder autopilot artificial feel unit revealed that the radial play of the autopilot mode engagement/disengagement lever was not sufficient. This introduced higher friction in the bearing of the lever, resulting in an increased operating force. In this case, the back driving force was not able to rotate the lever and disengage the autopilot mode. A review of all service bulletins (SBs) covering the A320 rudder system revealed an Airbus Industrie SB, dated March 21, 1992, which addressed this condition, and introduced a new modified lever with a larger radial play of the bearing to eliminate the problem.

He then flew a traffic pattern for landing on runway 26. During the landing flare the airplane began to drift left of the runway centerline, and at touchdown the tail of the airplane swerved to the left. The pilot unsuccessfully attempted to correct the airplane's path then initiated a go-around. He reported that after adding full power for the go-around, the airplane was headed to the right, at an angle that he estimated to be about 45 degrees from the runway alignment. Before the airplane could become airborne, it exited the right side of the runway and struck a low earthen berm. The airplane came to rest upright, with the right main landing gear fractured and separated from the fuselage. Additional damage included a bent propeller, a crushed nose cowl, crush damage to the lower fuselage, and bending and crush damage to both wings. There were no recorded meteorological data for the accident airport, but review of meteorological data from an airport about 10 miles north indicated conditions similar to those reported by the pilot. The pilot reported approximately 2,000 hours of a total flight experience, including about 30 hours in the accident airplane make and model in the past 30 days.

The flight was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) on-demand commercial flight under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 135.  The certificated commercial pilot and two passengers sustained no injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight. Company flight following procedures were in effect and a company flight plan was filed and activated.During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge, along with a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation safety inspector on March 13, 2015, the pilot stated that while en route, about  1,000 feet above ground level (AGL), he felt a \"clunk\" in the tail rotor control pedals and the helicopter began to yaw to the left. When he attempted to counteract the yaw by depressing the right tail rotor control pedal, there was no reaction from the helicopter and the right pedal travelled to the forward stop. The pilot declared an in-flight emergency with air traffic control, returned to Merrill Field, and executed an emergency run-on landing. A post flight examination of the helicopter revealed the tail rotor pitch change spider assembly, part number 350A33-2030-00, had fractured into multiple pieces, all with rotational scarring present along the fractured surfaces. The inside of the spider assembly contained dark discoloration consistent with thermal damage. Light circumferential scarring was present on the tail rotor gear shaft about three inches outboard of the tail rotor gear box, approximately one inch wide.The fractured tail rotor pitch change spider assembly and the tail rotor gear box were retained.

He said he leaned the fuel mixture, observing fuel flows of about 10.5 to 11gallons per hour on his JPI analyzer, and that the quantity of fuel remaining never was less than 20 gallons. Upon reaching his destination airport he said he over-flew the airport to observe the winds, and then flew 6 miles south, twice circling his friend's house, and then returned to land. During the approach, while turning to base he applied 30 degrees of flaps, at which time the engine ceased operating. He said obstacles included trees and utility wires, and during the glide, after avoiding the trees, he selected 40 degrees of flaps in an attempt to balloon over the wires, and the airplane stalled and descended impacting the ground. During the pilot's report of the accident to the NTSB  he stated that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions to the airplane or any of its systems. A witness stated that he saw the accident airplane on downwind, rocking its wings, and he saw it on final approach and as it came over the trees. He said the propeller had stopped rotating, and as he continued watching, it appeared as if the pilot was trying to stretch the glide. He said he saw the airplane stall and descend, impacting the ground a short distance from the runway. On the day of the accident, an FAA inspector responded to the scene of the accident and found no evidence of fuel spillage at the scene. When the airplane was checked, the inspector found about 2 gallons of fuel in the left tank, and no fuel in the right tank. On March 10, 2006, an FAA licensed mechanic, under the supervision of the FAA inspector, conducted a detailed examination of the airplane's airframe and engine, and no anomalies were noted. The accident airplane was equipped with a Texas Skyways Incorporated conversion O-520 -U/TS engine. On July 17, 2007, a technician at Texas Skyways stated to the NTSB that Texas Skyways did not publish endurance documentation for their conversions because of the various models of engines they modified, and their variability in fuel consumption. He further stated that from his experience, climb to cruise fuel consumption for the O-520 U/TS engine, at  a rate of climb of about 1,000 feet per minute, at full power, without leaning for changes in altitude would yield a fuel consumption of about 23 gallons per hour. He further stated that with leaning the mixture, and with other climb related adjustments, the average fuel consumption during the climb should be about 18 gallons per hour. At an altitude of 9,000 feet, the technician also estimated that the airplane should consume about 14 gallons per hour, while in cruise flight. In addition, the technician also said that JPI endurance data was consistent with the exhaust and cylinder head temperatures noted.",

Although the toxicological test result levels were different between the Federal Aviation Administration laboratory and the local toxicological testing, both results were consistent with recent ingestion of a medication containing brompheniramine, which most likely impaired the pilot's judgment and performance of complex cognitive and motor tasks during the flight.",

Balloon A, N2037U, was at a lower altitude and in front of balloon B, N20513. As the pilots were descending to land, balloon A began to slow about 10 feet above ground level and the pilot of balloon B realized that the balloons' envelopes might touch, which he noted was not uncommon during takeoffs and landings. As balloon A came closer into his view, he thought the contact may push it into the ground, so he decided to ascend. During the climb, the basket of balloon B collided with the envelope of balloon A, tearing two of its panels just above the equator, resulting in substantial damage. The pilot of balloon B landed his balloon without further incident. The pilot of balloon A observed the envelope tearing and opened both burners. His balloon contacted the ground and bounced, momentarily becoming airborne again before touching down.

The briefing also included an airmen\u2019s meteorological information advisory for developing instrument flight rules conditions due to low ceilings and mist. Shortly after takeoff, the pilot contacted a radar approach controller for visual flight rules flight-following services, and he was advised to squawk a beacon code,\u00a0but, before the approach controller was able to identify the airplane on the radar, the pilot radioed, \u201cI\u2019m in trouble.\u201d Shortly after, both radar and radio contact were lost. Review of radar data indicated that the airplane\u2019s climb rate was steady until the airplane reached an altitude of about 2,100 ft msl. The airplane then began descending rapidly while turning right until it impacted terrain. \u000b\u000bExamination of the wreckage did not reveal any evidence of preimpact failures or malfunctions of the engine or primary flight controls. However, examination of the elevator trim system revealed that the elevator trim cable was disconnected from the trim control wheel in the cockpit and that it had pulled out of a swaged rod end (bolt), which displayed a longitudinal crack on the outer surface of the swage. \u000bExamination of the fracture surface revealed that the fracture occurred due to overstress. The examinations were not able to determine if the cable pulled out of the fitting during the accident sequence or if it was a pre-existing condition. Regardless, review of the elevator pitch control system revealed that, even if the elevator trim cable had disconnected in flight, it should not have led to an uncontrollable situation due to its redundant design.\u000b\u000bAt the time of the accident, both the sun and the moon were more than 15 degrees below the horizon. Further, warm, moist southerly wind ahead of an approaching cold front was producing variable clouds, and a band of low stratiform clouds with their tops near 4,000 ft existed over the area. Operating in MVFR conditions increases a pilot\u2019s workload and stress level because navigation becomes more difficult and reduces the margin of safety. As a result of the increased workload and stress level and the pilot\u2019s minimal simulated instrument time (about 7 hours); his minimal night experience (about 3 hours); the dark, night MVFR conditions; restricted visibility, including a lack of ambient light; and the sustained right turn and descent, it is likely the pilot experienced spatial disorientation and subsequently lost control of the airplane.",

As the helicopter crossed over a series of power lines, the pilot heard a \"loud pop\" and felt an extreme vibration. The pilot maneuvered the helicopter away from the power lines and initiated a forced landing to an open field. He reported that control of the helicopter was \"marginal\" as the helicopter descended. Shortly before touchdown, the helicopter began to drift (un commanded) to the left and the pilot lowered the collective. The helicopter touched down hard, pivoted to the left and rolled over onto its right side. Post accident examination of the helicopter revealed that a control rotor had separated from the rotor system. The separated control rotor was found in the area where the vibration started.  Examination of the control rotor assembly revealed the tubular spar of the blue control rotor was circumferentially fractured at the outboard cuff bolt location. Magnified examinations of the outboard fracture surfaces revealed surface features consistent with fatigue progression in two fronts around the spar. Fatigue initiation locations were identified on opposite sides of one of the outboard bolt holes in the spar. One fatigue origin was identified on the bore surface of the bolt hole and the other was mechanically damaged preventing determination of its exact location. The bore surface was rough and no obvious corrosion was noted in the hole. From the bolt hole the fatigue propagated almost entirely around the spar with very small overstress regions connecting the fatigue to the opposite bolt hole in the spar. No corrosion was noted in the originating bolt hole, however, the exterior surface of the spar exhibited wide spread pitting corrosion and fretting on the faying surfaces with the control rotor cuff.

The pilot, whose aircraft was equipped with radar and Stormscope equipment, filed an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan and departed under IFR.  Upon radar contact, ATC cleared the pilot direct to his destination.  21 minutes later, while flying on the direct (northwesterly) track to the destination, the aircraft entered a Level 4 thunderstorm cell.  The pilot told air traffic control (ATC), '...[I] hit a pretty heavy cell here [I've] got lightning all around and picking up some hard ice.'  The crew of another aircraft deviating to the north of the storm suggested the aircraft turn north to exit the weather.  ATC relayed this suggestion, and the pilot replied he was turning to the north. The aircraft then entered a right turn; radar contact was lost after approximately 90 degrees of turn.  6 seconds after the time at the last radar position, the pilot radioed, '...[I'm] in a tremendous downdraft [I'm] losing altitude six thousand'.  This was the last transmission received from the accident aircraft.  A search for the aircraft was initiated; the aircraft wreckage was found approximately 11 1/2 hours later, approximately 1 1/2 miles south of the last radar position. Logbooks recovered from the wreckage indicated the pilot was not current for IFR flight. ",

Because there was not sufficient power to keep the aircraft airborne, the pilot elected to execute a forced landing in a nearby field. He therefore started dumping his load of fertilizer, and attempted to set the aircraft down on the soft terrain. Although the touchdown was successful, soon thereafter the main gear sank into the soft terrain, and the right main gear leg folded aft. As the gear leg collapsed, the nose and right wing of the aircraft impacted the terrain. A post-accident inspection of the engine revealed that the head of the number seven cylinder had fractured circumferentially just above the location where the head screws into the cylinder barrel. Although the head had not separated from the barrel, the fracture was far enough around the barrel that it created a misalignment of the cylinder geometry to an extent that the intake valve would not close. There was no indication of detonation or any other anomaly that would have been expected to apply greater than normal loads to the cylinder structure.",

The pilot performed a preflight inspection of the airplane, during which no anomalies were noted. During the initial climb out, the engine stopped producing power, the pilot confirmed that the throttle was in the full forward position, and he looked for a place to land. According to a witness, the airplane \"barely cleared trees\" during the takeoff climb before it descended out of view. The airplane impacted several trees and came to rest upright in a residential yard. Examination of the airplane revealed that the fuel selector valve was between the \"BOTH\" and \"LEFT\" fuel tank position and the carburetor contained approximately 1 teaspoon of fuel. Tests conducted on the fuel selector valve indicated that in the position as found after the accident, the selector valve allowed some fluid to exit the output valves; however, the exact amount of fuel could not be accurately determined. Therefore, as the engine increased from an idle power setting to a full takeoff power setting the fuel was consumed in the carburetor at a more rapid rate than could be replaced. Several checklists and a placard that was on the fuel selector valve indicated that the valve must be in the \"BOTH\" position for takeoff; however, according to one passenger, they have performed the checklists so many times that they do not \"pull the card out anymore.\" Examination of the seatbelt attach point revealed that screws were utilized to attach the seatbelts to the airframe, instead of bolts as specified by the airplane parts catalog.

At that time, the pilot-rated passenger reported hearing \"popping and tearing\" from the area of the baggage door. The pilot disengaged the autopilot and slowed the airplane. The vibrations stopped. He then performed a slow descent and completed a safe landing at his destination airport. Examination of the airplane, a monoplane with a \"V\" tail, revealed downward bending of the rear fuselage with diagonal buckling of the skin on each side, and tearing of the skin on the bottom. The two elevators were found properly attached, and properly balanced. A weather study revealed cumulus clouds developing in the area on the satellite imagery, and therefore the potential for convectively induced turbulence from towering cumulus clouds.

The pilot initiated a left turn toward the airport; however, during the approach, he realized that the airplane was unable to reach the runway. Subsequently, the airplane struck the top of a tree and then impacted the ground in an open area of a golf course.A postaccident examination of the airplane's engine revealed that the carburetor's main metering jet was unscrewed from its seat and rotated 90 degrees. The unseated jet would have allowed an increased fuel flow through the main metering orifice, producing an extremely rich fuel-to-air ratio, which would have resulted in the loss of engine power. It is likely that, over time, the jet gradually loosened from its seat, which allowed it to eventually rotate 90 degrees. No further mechanical failures or malfunctions were revealed that would have precluded normal operation.A review of the airplane's maintenance records indicated that the carburetor was rebuilt during the airplane's restoration about 17 years before the accident. The carburetor maintenance instruction manual contained no pertinent instructions for the installation of the jet assemblies. Further, no maintenance entries in the engine logbook regarding carburetor maintenance were found. Had the carburetor maintenance instruction manual identified a means to ensure the security of the main metering jet, it is unlikely that the jet would have become unseated. There was no record of maintenance personnel inspecting the carburetor jets during the previous 17 years nor was there a requirement to do so.The front and rear seats of the airplane were equipped with non-factory-installed shoulder harnesses. The pilot's shoulder harness was installed by mounting the end of the restraint to the lower portion of the seatback assembly, which was made of thin aluminum. No reinforcement material or doublers were installed at or around the attachment bolt hole in the seatback. The lack of reinforcement allowed the attachment bolt, washers, and stop nut to be pulled upward and through the seatback structure during the impact sequence, which resulted in the pilot's loss of shoulder harness restraint. It is likely that the improperly installed shoulder harness contributed to the severity of the pilot's injuries.As a result of this investigation, the NTSB is working with the pilot community to inform them of the lessons learned from this accident: the security of the carburetor's main metering jet and the security of the shoulder harness are both critical aspects of aviation safety.",

The windsock indicated the wind was out of the northeast, so he took off on runway 6 and made a crosswind turn midfield.  He saw a glider release from its tow plane, and he watched as the tow plane landed and taxied to its staging area.  The glider was then 'on a downwind and at the position he was at. . .I had plenty of time to land and turn off.'  He took his eyes off the glider to concentrate on his landing.  When he touched down, ground personnel directed his attention to the glider that was touching down on the opposite end of the runway.  The pilot said he was rolling too fast to apply brakes, so he applied power and lifted off, intending to land on the parallel taxiway.

The aerobatic box measured 1 kilometer square, and extended from the surface up to 6,600 feet msl (5000' agl).  The southern boundary of the aerobatic box was located about 1,490 feet north of runway 5L's centerline.  Concurrently, a Piper J3C airplane with the commercial pilot/flight instructor/airplane owner seated in the front seat, and a private pilot seated in the rear seat, departed runway 5L, and made a left downwind turn into the area where the glider was performing the aerobatic maneuvers.  Witnesses said that as the glider reached the top of the loop, the nose lowered, eventually pointing straight down.  As the glider began to recover from the maneuver, about 600 feet agl, the left wing of the oncoming Piper struck the tail of the glider between the empennage and the main fuselage, severing the empennage of the glider.  Witnesses said that during the collision, a large portion of the left outboard wing of the Piper separated, and both the glider and the Piper entered uncontrolled descents.

Earlier on the day of the accident, the airplane experienced a loss of engine power during an instructional flight.  The student pilot switched fuel tanks, engine power was regained, and the airplane landed without further incident.  Subsequent maintenance inspection revealed no fuel flow when fuel was drained through the gascolator with the right fuel tank selected.  The mechanic inspected the airplane and called the CFI to perform a maintenance test flight in the airport traffic pattern.  No anomalies were noted during the engine runup for the maintenance test flight.  The test flight was planned to be conducted in the airport traffic pattern at traffic pattern altitude.  The CFI reported that on the turn to base leg, she adjusted the throttle to 1,700 rpm, and the engine started to sputter and ran rough at an engine speed of 500 rpm.  The CFI reported running the engine-out checklist by memory, but it did not accomplish an engine restart.  The CFI decided the best option was to land in a cornfield to avoid trees and power lines.  A postaccident investigation revealed that there were no detents evident in the fuel selector and that it was difficult to turn. The fuel selector did not possess safety wire on its mounting screws.  The carburetor drain valve exhibited a brown colored material consistent with rust.   The carburetor float had a green line around the float and rested above its minimum level.  The green line was consistent with a reaction of the bronze float with water.
