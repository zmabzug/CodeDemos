Subsequently, the flight entered a spin from which the PIC was unable to recover. The airplane descended uncontrollably into a large tree and then impacted the ground. The PIC reported that he could not recall how or why the airplane entered a spin. Although the airplane had been spin tested by the manufacturer, it was not approved for intentional spins. Examination of the wreckage, including the flight controls, and engine revealed no malfunctions or failures that would have precluded recovery from the spin.Although the airplane was equipped with a ballistic recovery system parachute, it was found unarmed and, thus, did not deploy. The PIC reported that he chose to depart with the parachute system activation handle safety pin installed instead of removed, which was not in accordance with the procedures in the Pilot Operating Handbook. Further, the location of the activation handle behind the left seat on this airplane make and model would have rendered it difficult for the PIC, who was in the right seat, to access during the uncontrolled descent. The manufacturer moved the activation handle to the lower portion of the pilot\u2019s instrument panel to allow for easier access. The PIC reported that he performed weight and balance calculations before departure and based his calculations on the provided passenger weight (275 pounds); the airplane was at the top of the envelope but within weight and balance limitations. However, postmortem external examination indicated that the passenger actually weighed 340 pounds, which resulted in the airplane being 64 pounds above the maximum allowable ramp weight at engine start.

He was then radar vectored towards the closest airport but was unable to reach it. The airplane impacted trees, was partially consumed by a postimpact fire, and the pilot was fatally injured. Examination of the engine's fuel servo revealed that the hub stud in the fuel servo diaphragm assembly was fractured, which would have resulted in the fuel servo being unable to properly meter fuel. Review of maintenance records revealed that an engine overhaul had been completed approximately 18 hours prior to the accident and that the fuel servo was shipped to the fuel servo manufacturer, where the unit was overhauled using the manufacturer's components. Examination of the hub stud revealed that it fractured as a result of fatigue cracking. The most likely cause of the fatigue cracking was a lack of braze material, which should have filled the gap between the hub stud and the hub and would have supported the shoulder of the hub stud. The manufacturer's brazing process documentation indicated that a visual check would have been performed to ensure that the braze did not exceed a certain measurement over the hub or hub stud, but there was no specific indication that a check would have been made to ensure that the braze was visible at the joint edges as required by the braze process specification, nor did any of the records provided by the manufacturer indicate the quantity of braze to be used for each assembly or how it was applied.The hub stud from the airplane and a hub stud from an exemplar assembly (from the same batch) were also found to be significantly softer than specified by the manufacturer's assembly drawing. Based on the hardness measurements, the ultimate tensile strengths of these hub studs was only about 80 percent of the expected tensile strength. Fatigue resistance of the hub stud would have correlated with the tensile strength, so the reduced hardness relative to the specification likely played some role in the rapid onset and propagation of the fatigue cracking. The reduced hardness of the hub studs indicated that the thermal history for the brazing process was either incorrectly specified or that the process was not properly controlled for this lot of assemblies. Also indicative of the manufacturer\u2019s poor quality control was the lack of conformance to the drawings for the hub stud from the airplane and the exemplar hub studs; these hub studs had a groove perpendicular to the axis of the stud at the termination of the threads on the hub end, which was not in the drawing, and may have increased the stress concentrations. The hub stud from the accident fractured at the midplane of this groove, at the plane of maximum stress concentration.",

A witness, who was located 2.82 miles south of the accident site, stated that it was dark, the wind was calm, and the sky was clear.  He observed the airplane in-flight overhead flying at a \"high speed\" at an altitude of about 500 feet above the ground (agl).

The pilot unsuccessfully attempted to diagnose and correct the problem. Although the pilot initially believed that the airplane could reach the airport, it was unable to maintain altitude. When the airplane was about 2 miles from the runway and over a lake, the pilot began a right 180-degree turn to land on an unobstructed portion of the shoreline. During the turn, the right wing struck the lake, and the airplane then came to rest inverted in about 2 ft of water. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical problems that would have precluded normal operation and continued flight. However, detailed examination of the three-bladed, controllable-pitch propeller revealed that one steel actuating pin, located inside the propeller hub and which controlled the pitch of one blade, had failed in fatigue. The pin\u2019s failure caused the pins to be torn from the other two propeller blades, which allowed the blades to rotate freely in the propeller hub and resulted in a loss of propeller thrust and the vibration that was felt by the pilot. About 7 years before the airplane was manufactured, the propeller manufacturer changed the design of the component hole (the \u201cpropeller ferrule\u201d) from a through hole to a blind hole that only penetrated one surface of the ferrule. The ferrule accepted the threaded end of the pin, and the corresponding pin thread length was reduced so that the pin would not contact the bottom of the hole when installed. The postaccident examination indicated that the failed pin was likely the longer pin associated with the previous design as evidenced by the contact and deformation of the bottom of the ferrule hole, which resulted in visible ferrule damage. The manufacturer\u2019s guidance explicitly addressed and prohibited installation of the longer pins in the blind ferrule hole. Bottoming of the pin in ferrule hole and the hole\u2019s subsequent deformation during installation prevented the proper seating of the pin and permitted operational bending loads to be transmitted to the threaded portion of the pin, which was not designed for such bending loads. The bending loads on the threaded portion resulted in crack initiation in the pin thread valley and the eventual fatigue failure of the pin. Review of the maintenance records indicated that multiple people had owned the airplane and that it had been continuously maintained in an airworthy condition through annual inspections and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance since at least 1998. However, the propeller was last overhauled more than 15 years before the accident, which exceeded the propeller manufacturer\u2019s recommended overhaul interval by a factor of three. The investigation could not determine why the owners or maintenance personnel did not comply with the propeller manufacturer's recommended overhaul interval. Further, the maintenance records did not provide sufficient detail to determine why the incorrect part was used or why its incorrect use and resulting damage were not detected during the overhaul. If the propeller had been overhauled in accordance with the propeller manufacturer\u2019s guidance, the improper pin installation likely would have been detected and the damaged, nonairworthy propeller would have been replaced with an airworthy unit.",
            "probable_cause": "The improper overhaul of the propeller, which resulted in the installation of an incorrect propeller actuating pin and deformation of the ferrule hole and led to the pin\u2019s fatigue failure. Contributing to the accident was the failure of multiple owners and maintenance technicians to comply with the propeller manufacturer's recommended overhaul interval."

After activating the high-power fuel boost pump setting and subsequently switching fuel tanks, the pilot performed a forced landing to a nearby field; the boost pump remained activated for the rest of the flight. During the landing, the airplane collided with trees, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and right wing. Fuel normally flows by gravity from each wing\u2019s fuel tank to a three-position selector valve. The selector valve then allows fuel flow from either the left wing tank, the right wing tank, or both tanks simultaneously.

A visual engine examination and engine test run with fuel supplied directly to the fuel selector revealed no engine operating anomalies, indicating that the pilot likely had the right fuel tank selected when the engine first lost power.

The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.  The private pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, was fatally injured.  There were no reported ground injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight.  The local flight originated from Brackett Field Airport (POC), La Verne, California, about 1619.Information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration revealed that the airplane was receiving vectors for the instrument landing system (ILS) 26R instrument approach at the Chino Municipal Airport (CNO), by Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control (SoCal TRACON).  Review of the recorded communication between the pilot and SoCal TRACON revealed that the pilot was issued a heading change to 350 degrees by the controller.  The pilot responded shortly after that he had lost the engine, and needed to land at Riverside.  The controller responded with the location of RAL, and asked if the pilot had the airport in sight, which the pilot acknowledged.  The controller advised the pilot to proceed inbound to RAL and that he could land on the runway of his discretion.  The pilot responded that he was going to land into the wind, and the controller repeated that the runway was his discretion, and asked how many people were on board.  The pilot responded that he was the only person onboard and that he was going to land into the wind.Shortly after, the controller relayed the current weather conditions at RAL, which included reported wind from 280 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 18 knots, and cleared the pilot to land on runway 27.  Subsequently, the pilot responded that he was not going to make it.  No further radio communication was received from the pilot.Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane struck a power pole and power lines about .50 miles south of the approach end of runway 27.  The first identified point of contact was a power pole, which exhibited a downed wire and impact marks about 40 feet above ground level.  Portions of the right flap and right ruddervator were located adjacent to the power pole.  The right wing was located about 40 feet beyond the power pole, in the middle of a residential street.  The main wreckage was located about 89 feet from the power pole, in a residential yard and consisted of the fuselage, left wing, engine, left ruddervator, and a downed street light pole.  The wreckage debris path was oriented on a heading of about 045 degrees magnetic.   All major structural components were located within the debris path.

The commercial pilot was fatally injured. Low ceilings and fog prevailed. A company flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated at Roscoe Turner Airport (CRX), Corinth, Mississippi, destined for Scottsboro Municipal Airport-Word Field (4A6), Scottsboro, Alabama. The positioning flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to a witness, a former private pilot, he heard the helicopter land in a National Park Service field contiguous to his property, about 3,900 feet from the 1-mile-long, north-south Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge. He couldn't see the bridge at the time due to fog and light mist.The helicopter remained on the ground for about 45 seconds, still powered with rotors turning; then power increased and it took off smoothly, clearing trees by about 30 feet. The helicopter subsequently headed toward the bridge, and after about 10 to 15 seconds, the witness lost sight of it in the fog. As the helicopter flew, the witness heard no anomalies, and the engine sounded \"healthy.\" He subsequently heard the helicopter hit the water with no change in sound until impact.According to another witness, he was fishing under the south end of the bridge when the accident occurred. The weather was foggy with low visibility and rain.The witness heard the helicopter for about 10 to 15 minutes before seeing it coming toward him, paralleling the west side of the bridge. When he first saw the helicopter through the fog, it was level with the top of the bridge. It began a gradual descent, then about 10 seconds before water impact, dropped (nose-dived) to about 25 feet above the water. It subsequently descended at a 10- to 15-degree angle, and impacted the water near the center of the river, about 50 to 100 feet east of a green buoy (about 100 yards west of the bridge.)There was no change in sound before the helicopter hit the water, with the same \"whining\" noise until impact. At impact, the witness saw the helicopter's tail \"kick over\" the top of the main rotor blades and snap off. The helicopter did not hit the bridge.The helicopter was recovered from the river on April 9, 2015. It was missing the aft part of the tail boom, including the tail rotor and gear box, from about 33 inches (fuselage station 230) aft of the tail boom mount, and only remnants of one main rotor blade were subsequently recovered; the other blades remained missing. The left skid was also missing.Damage began at the helicopter's front, lower left side, and extended upwards. There was no hydraulic crushing (water impact damage) to the bottom of the fuselage.Control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit to the rotor head, both vertically through the collective, and laterally and longitudinally through the cyclic. Yaw control through the rudder pedals was confirmed from the cockpit to the remnants of the \"long tail rotor control rod\" in the severed tail boom.Rotor system drive continuity was confirmed from the engine to the transmission, the transmission to the rotor hub, and from the transmission aft to where the tail rotor drive shaft was severed along with the tail boom.Three of the five rotor blades were separated just outboard of the doubler at the main rotor root fitting, and two blades were separated through the strap assemblies and blade pitch housings, consistent with full power on the rotor system at water impact. Extensive damage was also found on the hub upper shoe in the vicinity of all five pitch change housings, consistent with a medium-to-high collective setting at the time of impact.",

The pilot turned toward the herd.  As he slowed down and maneuvered the helicopter to view the animals he detected the engine out audio warning and corresponding engine out warning light.  The pilot noticed the rotor rpm dropping and he looked at the engine turbine outlet temperature gauge to verify that the engine had lost power.  He added that he could no longer hear the engine.

Data downloaded from an on-board global positioning system (GPS) showed that the helicopter took off from the support truck and headed in a westerly direction and accelerated to about 52 miles per hour. The GPS track passed over the location where the spray nozzles were found. The recorded altitude from the GPS was below the elevation of the surrounding terrain. Therefore, the altitude information from the GPS was not accurate enough to use for flight analysis.

The planned flight route included a contour search pattern into a series of drainages along the Minam River valley, including the canyon in which the accident occurred.  A trainee at the clinic who flew the accident flight route with the accident flight 'mentor' on the accident aircraft's previous flight reported that he had refused to fly into most of the drainages on the route, believing that the aircraft did not have sufficient climb capability or space to turn around in the drainages.  This trainee reported that the route segment where the accident occurred was flown at 90 knots with 10 degrees of flaps. When the accident flight failed to return to base at the scheduled time and contact could not be established with the aircraft, a search was begun.  The aircraft wreckage was located approximately two days later, with both occupants found fatally injured at the accident site.  A chart of the planned flight route showed that at the approximate location of the crash site, a 135-degree turn was to be made to climb out, exit the training route and return to base. The accident site, located at the 5,400-foot level on sloping terrain, was approximately 1/2 mile beyond the depicted turn point (i.e., further into the canyon than planned.)

The trainee pilot stated that the wheat at that time \"was a solid dark green which gave no depth perception\", which he stated \"in essence created an invisible...wall\" on short final.  While on short final, the aircraft contacted the wheat, causing a rapid deceleration and loss of altitude (the flight instructor stated that once he noticed the terrain rise, he was unable to get on the controls before the aircraft contacted the wheat.)  The airplane subsequently struck an approximately 2-foot-high bank along a dirt road approximately 40 feet from the end of the runway.

The pilot reported that his preflight checks were normal. After a courtesy radio call to Temple UNICOM, the pilot initiated takeoff. Immediately after takeoff, the helicopter started a counter clockwise yaw. The pilot stated that the anti-torque pedals were locked in the neutral position and felt jammed. He attempted to correct the rotation but was unable. After rotating several times, he executed a hovering autorotation. All the occupants exited the helicopter uninjured after the pilot shut down the helicopter.Post-incident examination of the helicopter and it's hydraulic system was conducted on July15, 2014.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local flight, which departed Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport (TMB), Miami, Florida, about 1210. The solo instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 141. According to the student pilot's flight instructor, the purpose of the flight was for the student pilot to remain in the traffic pattern at TMB and complete 3 takeoffs and landings. The airplane was dispatched at 1140, and the school was notified of the accident by a 911 operator at 1446. According to preliminary information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the airplane remained in the traffic pattern for 15 minutes before it departed the airport traffic area.Four witnesses on the east side of Elliott Key provided statements and their summaries of the events were consistent throughout. Two witnesses said their attention was drawn to the sound of the airplane's engine. They said the engine was \"wide open\" and at \"full power\" as the airplane descended vertically out of view on the west side of the key, and the sound of impact was heard. Two witnesses said the nose of the airplane \"pitched up\" momentarily before the airplane descended vertically at full power. Each witness described the airplane's descent as \"straight down\" with no rotation of the wings. The wreckage was recovered to and examined at Ft. Pierce, Florida on July 25, 2014, and all major components were accounted for at examination. The engine compartment, instrument panel, cockpit, cabin area, wings and empennage were completely destroyed by impact and fragmented into very small pieces. The largest sections were the vertical fin, horizontal stabilizer, elevator and landing-gear support structure with landing gear attached. The engine was still attached to the instrument panel area by wires and cables. Control cable continuity was established from the cockpit area to the rudder and elevator. Cable continuity was traced to the ailerons through several cable and bellcrank breaks, all of which displayed failures consistent with overload separation.The engine was separated from the main wreckage and displayed significant impact damage. The propeller was attached, and both blades displayed similar twisting, curling, and aft bending. The starter displayed rotational scoring on its face. The carburetor was destroyed by impact. All engine accessories were separated by impact except the right magneto.

Examination of the nose landing gear revealed the nose gear upper lock link, PN 3914464-503, had failed, and had separated into two pieces. The link, which was subject to recurring non-destructive testing every 5000 cycles (per AD 97-02-10), had an eddy current inspection by the operator, 1075 cycles before the accident.  The link was one of a series manufactured from plate stock, rather than being forged.  Due to this changed process, the lack of draft angle allowances on the machined parts reduced the load-carrying cross sectional area of the machined links to less than that of the forged links, resulting in a decrease in the overall strength. Metallurgical analysis revealed that about 10,000 major fatigue progression cycles had occurred within about .6 inches of the crack progression.  Based on two major stress cycles per gear retraction/extension cycle, the crack length at 1075 cycles before the accident would have been greater than .25 inches.  The inspection procedure and process provided by the airframe manufacturer did not specify removal of the upper lock link from the aircraft before recurring non-destructive tests (NDT).

He said he flew the accident airplane from Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Chubb Cay, Bahamas, to Big Whale Cay, Bahamas, back to the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport. He said he then departed Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport with his next load of passengers and flew to the North Eleuthera Airport, North Eleuthera, Bahamas, without having refueled, and was returning from North Eleuthera, Bahamas, to the Fort Lauderdale International Airport, when he ditched the airplane off Dania Beach, Florida, in the Atlantic Ocean. When asked whether the fuel on board the airplane had been exhausted, the pilot stated, \" the way the engines were acting, it seemed like the airplane ran out of fuel.\" On scene examination of the airplane, as well as follow on examination of its engines revealed no preaccident anomalies with the airplane or its systems. Information obtained from the FAA showed that at 1757, the pilot contacted FAA Miami Approach Control and advised \"minimum fuel, further stating that he was not declaring an emergency at that time. At 1758, the controller responded, passing communications control to the FAA Fort Lauderdale Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT).

The published approach minimums for the LDA/DME RWY 34 approach are an 800-foot ceiling and one-mile visibility.  One surviving passenger on the airplane reported that as the airplane dropped below the clouds, it collided with the trees during the night.  He added that it was foggy at the lower altitude.  Another surviving passenger reported that the flight circled the airport once while the pilot was \"punching numbers on a pad on the instrument panel.\"  He also stated that \"they couldn't see the runway lights\" and the airplane collided with the trees short of the airport.  About the time of the accident, a 400-foot ceiling was reported.  After the accident, the runway lighting was verified as being operational.  An examination of the airplane failed to reveal any anomalies with the airframe or systems.  The aircraft collided with the trees in a wings level attitude approximately 4 miles from, and on the approach path to the runway.  The instrument approach was flight checked as \"fully operational\" by the FAA following the accident.  The pilot disregarded the glide slope information and tried to \"duck\" under the prevailing fog in order to see the approach lights.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from obstacles.  Contributing factors were the below approach/landing weather minimums, and the prevailing dark night conditions."
