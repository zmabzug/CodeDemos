During the flight, the pilot noted the right fuel tank guage showed about 3/4 full, and the left guage showed about 1/4 full. He was not concerned because he knew he had sufficient fuel due to timing. About 2 hours, 45 minutes of flight time after refueling, the engine lost power. The pilot's attempts to restart the engine by switching fuel tanks and applying carburetor heat were unsuccessful. The airplane descended into trees, coming to rest nose-down in a near-vertical attitude. The following day, the pilot and an FAA inspector saw fuel leaking from the right wing fuel cap vent, but not from the left. A postaccident engine test revealed that, with fuel in both tanks, the engine would start and operate with fuel selected from the left tank and both tanks, but not from the right tank. Additional examination revealed that a small steel ball from the right supply side of the fuel selector had migrated to the gascolator. The steel ball would have normally been able to push against a spring-loaded larger steel ball, which then would have been displaced away from an orifice to allow fuel to flow. The airplane's owner and a friend, who were not certificated mechanics, had previously performed maintenance on the fuel selector, which likely dislodged the small steel ball. The dislodged small steel ball would normally have prevented fuel flow from the right tank immediately. However, the right tank did supply fuel to the engine for about 10 subsequent hours of airplane operation, likely because the larger steel ball had been temporarily jammed into an open position due to debris found in the fuel selector.",

Witnesses saw the helicopter flying approximately 350 feet above the ground when it nosed over and entered a sharp 70-degree bank and dove towards the ground. The helicopter was equipped with a video camera. Analysis of the video revealed a \u201csmall perturbation in yaw (nose towards the left) followed by a return back to the right of equal magnitude.\u201d The perturbation was \u201cno larger or faster\u201d than other yaw motions seen previously during the flight. About two seconds later, the helicopter began a slow, smooth roll to the right and the ground was no longer visible. The helicopter came down through trees at a 72-degree impact angle. The right skid was embedded in the ground at a 25-degree angle. Both main rotor blades bore evidence of tree strikes. The clevis ends of the pitch change tubes remained attached to their respective horns. The pitch and collective control rods remained attached to their linkages, and the linkages were attached to their respective servos. Control continuity was established. One tail rotor blade was straight and the other blade was bent 90 degrees to the plane of rotation. There was no evidence of a main rotor blade strike against the horizontal stabilizer, synchronized elevator, or finlets or tail boom. Tail rotor continuity was established. Examination of the engine revealed the Pg line was only finger tight. Later pressure testing of the Pg line disclosed no leaks. The transmission, main drive shaft, and  freewheeling unit were disassembled and inspected. No anomalies were noted.

After landing, the pilot applied the brakes to slow the landing roll, and while depressing both brake pedals, the right brake pedal unexpectedly \"went to the floor\" and the airplane swerved to the left. The airplane ground looped to the left, sustaining substantial damage to the right wing and right aileron. A postaccident investigation revealed that a hydraulic supply line fitting on the airplane's right brake assembly had broken. The maintenance technician that did the repairs on the airplane's brake reported that the hydraulic supply line fitting was not removed during his work. He also said that he strongly suspected that the broken fitting might be an unapproved or \"bogus\" aircraft part due to an atypical thread pattern. An NTSB metallurgical examination revealed that the fractured fitting had failed due to a fatigue fracture. A Safety Board mechanical engineer noted that the broken fitting was marked with the \"AN\" (Air Force-Navy standards) identification stamp, signifying that it was approved for use in aircraft. Further investigation revealed that the fractured fitting was consistent in appearance to that of a fitting manufactured to meet the standards of a Joint Industrial Council (JIC), which is not intended for use in aircraft. The Safety Board mechanical engineer also noted that the two types of fitting are nearly indistinguishable except for the \"AN\" identification stamp. He added that without the aid of magnification, the \"JIC\" fittings and the \"AN\" fittings look identical. The \"AN\" fitting is reported to have a 40 percent increase in fatigue strength over the identical \"JIC\" fitting. There was no logbook entry which disclosed replacement of the hydraulic fittings, and the airplane's owner said that he was unaware when the brake line fittings had been replaced, but assumed it had been done prior to him purchasing the airplane.

Subsequently, the helicopter sank and was later recovered and examined.  Examination of the helicopter revealed no anomalies with the airframe or flight control systems.  Examination of the engine revealed that the first and second stage turbine blades were fractured due to extreme heating.  One blade of the second stage tubine disk had liberated from its retention slot, and all the blade roots and retention slots of this disk exhibited permanent outboard deformation, due to a combination of centripetal forces from engine operation and excessive heat.  In contrast, the blade roots and retention slots of the first stage turbine disk did not exhibit evidence of outboard deformation, most likely since they were located further away from the heat source.

The engine was secured in accordance with the checklist procedure, fuel was dumped, and the airplane returned to the airport without further incident. On-wing test bed testing first established a performance baseline for the engine, which was then tested with newly overhauled fan blades installed, and subsequently tested with a newly overhauled fan case installed in order to assess the effects of changing fan blade geometry and fan blade-to-fan case clearance. Initial testing of the engine did not result in an engine surge or any engine exceedences. An engine vane control trim check revealed that it was within the parameters for most of the engine power range, except for above the 90 percent corrected N2 speed, where it was slightly below the minimum value. Because the results did not significantly impact testing, the engine was not re-trimmed prior to testing the engine with new fan blades and a new fan case. Tests revealed that fan blade contour and shape had a bigger influence on the engine\u2019s surge margin and low pressure compressor (LPC) stability line than the fan blade-to-fan case clearance variations within the range of test conditions. Fan blades that were within the engine manual limits \u2013 rounder leading edges with little to no erosion and proper chord length \u2013 had improved LPC efficiency and engine stability. The last engine test was conducted with the compressor variable vanes re-trimmed open, and within limits at the high speed range, with the results indicating further improvement in LPC efficiency and stability. While no single variable likely resulted in the engine surge, several variables, including blade edge contour, variable blade trim and high altitude, likely combined to produce the stall/surge.",

The pilot stayed at the controls of the helicopter, and reduced the engine rpm to 70 percent as the ground personnel were loading their equipment into external baskets on the helicopter. The equipment included packs and a chain saw.  The ground personnel reported that the chain saw had not been used in the previous hour, and the engine was cold.  The pilot smelled smoke, and the passengers noticed flames under the helicopter.  The pilot attempted to regain full engine rpm to lift-off from the landing area, but was unable to do so because the engine quit running.  The pilot exited the helicopter, and along with the ground personnel, attempted to extinguish the flames on the ground.  They were unsuccessful, and the pilot attempted to restart the helicopter.  It would not start.  The fire consumed the helicopter, and about 60 acres of brush/grass.  This model helicopter's exhaust system is positioned at the rear and bottom portion of the aft fuselage.  The underside of the engine area is open, allowing cooling-fan air to exit aft and downward, around the muffler and exhaust.  The bottom of the muffler, at the rear area of the engine compartment is about 19.5 inches above the ground.  The exhaust pipe, routed through the rear bulkhead of the engine compartment, exits the aft end of the fuselage about 27 inches above the ground.  The pilot/operator manual for the helicopter contains a safety advisory that states, in part:  \"Never land in tall dry grass.  The exhaust is low to the ground and very hot; a grass fire may be ignited.\"",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for landing which precipitated a grass fire.  Factors contributing to the accident were the manufacturer's inadequate design of the helicopter's exhaust system, placing it low to the ground, and terrain conditions consisting of dry tussock grass."

Witnesses subsequently observed the airplane takeoff on runway 32, make a 180-degree turn toward the south, and then fly downwind and parallel to the runway at an altitude of between 300 and 500 feet above ground level.  At approximately the end of the runway the airplane was observed making a left turn onto base leg for runway 32, followed by a steep turn to final before nosing into the ground and bursting into flames.  The initial onsite examination of the airplane revealed that the engine's oil cap was not attached to the oil filler tube.  A further examination revealed damage to the oil filler tube and no damage to the oil filler cap, which would indicate that the cap was not in place at the time of impact.  A section of the right aileron and pieces of the airplane's windshield were examined for oil residue; no oil residue was detected on those parts.  Weight and balance information for the flight indicated that the airplane was approximately 165 pounds over its maximum gross takeoff weight at the time of the accident.  As a result of the engine's oil filler cap not being secured to the oil filler tube, it is reasonable to expect that an amount of oil would have escaped the engine and blown back over the pilot's windscreen, thereby obstructing his vision.

There were two crewmembers and a passenger onboard. One crewmember was fatally injured; the other crewmember and passenger received serious injuries. The airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to the Bank of Utah Trustee and operated by Vineland Corporation Company, Panama, South America under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from Tucson International Airport (KTUS), Tucson, Arizona, at 1004.According to preliminary information from the Federal Aviation Administration, the flight was in radio contact with ASE air traffic control (ATC). At 1210, N115WF utilized the localizer DME-E approach into KASE. ASE ATC reported winds as 290\u00ba at 19 knots, with winds gusting to 25 knots to the crew before landing. The crew executed a missed approach, and then requested to be vectored for a second attempt. On the second landing attempt N115WF briefly touched down on the runway, then bounced into the air and descended rapidly impacting with the ground at midfield.

The accident site was adjacent to a road and about 300 yards from a clear field. Despite these potential landing areas, the pilot decided to attempt to return to the airstrip by initiating a turn at low altitude and low airspeed following the loss of engine power, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and a loss of control with insufficient altitude to recover.During the impact, the pilot's seat separated from the airframe and moved forward about 6 inches, which allowed the pilot to impact the instrument panel and subsequently contributed to the severity of the pilot's injuries.",

The pilot force landed the airplane in a dirt field with the landing gear retracted.  Both fuel tanks were found to be approximately 1/2 full.  Further examination of the airframe revealed a short circuit of both magneto grounding leads in the electrical wiring between the magneto switch and the magneto.  The investigation determined that he wiring harnesses were original to the airplane, which was manufactured in 1964.  Investigators were able to successfully start the engine and perform a run-up under two separate conditions.  The first engine start occurred after investigators disconnected both p-leads at their respective magneto terminals.  The second engine start occurred after new electrical wire was connected from the magneto switch to both magnetos.  Investigators noted the general overall poor condition of the p-lead electrical wiring.

The tour was to circumnavigate a mountainous area on the island, with a visit to an extinct volcanic crater in a mountain valley.  Three helicopters departed on the tour, with about 2 minutes between each departure.  The pilot, who was employed by the operator 2.5-months earlier, was in trail behind the company's most experienced (chief) pilot, and second most experienced pilot.  None had received a weather briefing from an FAA approved source as required in the company operations specifications.  Throughout the flight they were in radio contact with each other.  The two lead pilots were a few minutes ahead of the accident pilot as he approached an area of the valley near the crater where inclement weather existed.  The second pilot ahead of the accident helicopter said that when he exited the crater near the accident site, he encountered heavy rain showers and lowering ceilings and visibilities.  Although the accident pilot attempted to follow the company pilots ahead of him, he did not observe the valley entrance to the Waialeale crater viewpoint and flew past it.  As the flight progressed, the pilot encountered lowering ceilings, heavy intensity rain showers, and reduced flight visibility.  The pilot became disoriented, misjudged his location, and while cruising toward what he believed was the prescribed crater entranceway inadvertently entered instrument meteorological conditions.  Just before the collision, the pilot transmitted to the pilots ahead of him that the weather was getting worse and that he could not see.  The second pilot then provided a suggested heading that would take the accident pilot away from the mountainous terrain.  The helicopter impacted the mountain on a heading nearly opposite of the one suggested.  The helicopter was subsequently recovered and examined.  No evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunction was noted.  Between 30 and 45 minutes after the accident, one of the operator's tour pilots reported receiving the signal of an emergency locator transmitter (ELT).

The pilot flying (PF) noticed the hydraulic fluid quantity decreasing. Subsequently, an amber left hydraulic system fail CAS message appeared. The pilot not flying (PNF) pulled out the checklist to accomplish the left hydraulic system failure procedures and then suggested a go-around because the landing runway was about 500 feet shorter than the recommended minimum runway length indicated in the checklist. The PF decided to land due to the hydraulic quantity indications, prior autopilot problems, and the airplane's landing configuration. The PNF turned on the auxiliary pump about 500 feet above ground level, and both the PF and PNF thought the auxiliary hydraulic system could support normal spoilers, brakes, and nosewheel steering. The PF selected right thrust reverser aft and began pressing the brakes, but he felt no braking action. He reached for the emergency brakes; however, he did not immediately apply them to slow the airplane because he decided that there was not enough distance remaining to stop the airplane on the runway. Therefore, he attempted to go around with insufficient runway remaining by advancing the throttles to the maximum continuous thrust setting. The PNF did not see the airspeed increase and believed that not enough runway remained to get airborne, so he pulled the throttles back to avoid a runway overrun. The airplane exited the runway and sustained substantial damage. A review of the cockpit voice recorder transcript indicated that, before the emergency, the flight crew did not maintain a disciplined cockpit environment that focused on operationally relevant discussion but instead repeatedly made reference to and discussed objects on the ground and other operationally irrelevant topics. The lack of a sterile cockpit did not promote crew coordination and communication and adherence to procedures, which would have helped mitigate this emergency.A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the nose landing gear swivel assembly, which had passed an acceptance test procedure before its installation on the airplane, was seized and bound and had a fracture on its inboard connecting tube, which was the site of the hydraulic fluid leak. The swivel assembly had galling wear scars on the outside diameter of the spool and the inside diameter of the housing; both the spool and housing were made from similar aluminum alloys that have a propensity to gall and adhere to each other when rubbed together. The connecting tube fracture was consistent with a single bending and torsional overload event associated with high opening forces or seizure in the center swivel due to galling wear. The center housing/spool seizure was consistent with a misalignment of the swivel, which led to the binding together of the similar aluminum alloys of the spool and housing. Further examination showed that the nose landing gear hydraulic system did not have a volumetric hydraulic fuse designed to minimize the loss of hydraulic fluid in the event of a line break downstream of such a device.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot flying's (PF) decision to land on a shorter-than-recommended runway with a known left hydraulic system failure rather than go around as suggested by the pilot-not-flying, his failure to immediately apply emergency brakes following the detection of the lack of normal brakes, and his attempt to go around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident was the nose landing gear swivel assembly failure, the lack of a hydraulic fuse before this critical failure point, and the design of the swivel using two similar alloys with a propensity to adhere to each other when rubbed together. Also contributing to the accident was the lack of a disciplined cockpit environment."

He also stated that he was concerned about the fuel quantity, so he decided to fly to an airport that had fuel facilities.  During the initial climb after the takeoff, the engine began to run rough.  The pilot ditched the airplane in a lake. He stated that the fuel tank pick-up ports may have unported during the 'steep' climb.  During the initial pilot interview after the event was upgraded from an incident to an accident, the pilot stated that he had destroyed all evidence that would be required to determine if fuel exhaustion or engine malfunction had occurred, and he did not provide requested information about refueling receipts.  Examination of the pilot's logbooks revealed that the pilot had logged 5.1 hours of flight time in the accident airplane during the 4 flights previous to the accident flight.  The log did not contain any reference to refueling or of any destination airports that have refueling facilities.  Calculations revealed that the airplane would have consumed more than its 43 gallons of useable fuel during the 4 previous flights. ",

Upon reaching the airport, due to local takeoff and landing terrain avoidance procedures, the pilot chose to land on a runway with a tailwind of approximately 10 knots. Believing that the aircraft's engine was experiencing a malfunction that reduced its ability to produce thrust, he chose to use only 20 degrees of flaps while on final. As he crossed the runway threshold, he realized that his ground speed was excessive, but elected not to go around because of the suspected engine problem and the danger of impacting the trees on rising terrain off the departure end of the runway. The aircraft touched down about half way down the wet runway, and although the pilot applied maximum braking, he was unable to stop the aircraft before it departed the far end of the runway and went over an embankment. A post-accident inspection of the engine determined that it had not malfunctioned, but multiple contaminants were found in the pitot system mast and lines. The size and structure of the contaminants were such that they interfered with the correct display of the aircraft's indicated airspeed. ",

He moved the fuel selector to the right tank position, yet the fuel gauges still kept moving rapidly toward zero. The pilot then attempted to make a radio call to declare an emergency; however, there was a complete electrical failure. He decided to make an emergency landing at a nearby airport, and as he started descending, the engine lost power. The pilot said that since the airplane was above clouds, he could not see the airport until the airplane was directly above it. As he approached runway 24, he realized he was too high and fast, so he overflew the runway and reversed course at the west end of the airport to attempt a landing on runway 06. He was too high and fast to land on runway 06 and did not have enough altitude or airspeed to make another attempt on runway 24. The airplane impacted the ground and obstacles about 0.5 miles east of the airport. During post-accident examination, fuel was found in both wing tanks and in the firewall-mounted fuel strainer. No evidence of significant fuel leakage was noted. No evidence was found of any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have prevented the engine from producing power. The reason for the reported loss of engine power could not be determined. A defective splice repair to the alternator output electrical wire was observed, and when the wire was removed, the splice came apart and revealed evidence of electrical arcing. The alternator was bench tested and found to be functional. The defective splice likely resulted in the anomalous fuel gauge readings noted by the pilot. The fact that air traffic control reported the airplane\u2019s transponder was broadcasting the codes for radio failure and then for emergency as the airplane descended indicates the airplane had not lost all electrical power. The pilot\u2019s inability to communicate by radio during the descent likely resulted from his improper positioning of avionics bus 1 switch to the OFF position where it was found, which would have cut off power to communications radio 1.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The purpose of the flight was for the flight instructor to conduct a flight review of the private pilot in his high-performance, experimental, amateur-built airplane. On-board data recovered from the airplane indicate that after departure, the airplane maneuvered for about 25 minutes before making a series of turns while gradually climbing. After reaching the highest altitude attained during the flight, the airplane began to descend and continued in an increasingly tightening right turn, creating a hook-type shape at the end of the radar track. This hook occurred over 15 seconds, with the airplane\u2019s pitch dropping from level to -68 degrees. This coincided with a vertical speed change from about -300 ft per minute (fpm) to a peak of -22,000 fpm, and a g-load increase to 7G, while the indicated airspeed peaked about 310 kts. The airplane broke apart in flight and the wreckage debris was scattered over an estimated 1,600-ft area of flat terrain.\u000b\u000bThe instructor was experienced in the airplane and had flown with the private pilot before. The private pilot did not hold a current medical, although he always flew with an instructor onboard. The private pilot built the airplane about 4.5 years before the accident. The autopsy reports for both pilots revealed that the cause of death was blunt force trauma and no medical events likely occurred while in flight.\u000b\u000bA performance study of the airplane\u2019s flight revealed that the accident sequence only required about 79 percent of the available lift from the wing until well after the descent was established; consequently, the sequence was unlikely to have been precipitated by an aerodynamic stall. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation. Flight control system continuity could not be confirmed due to the extensive damage incurred during the inflight break up. Accordingly, the reason for the steepening spiral dive, with increasing roll angle and speed, could not be established. \u000b\u000bTwenty-six percent of Lancair airplanes have been involved in accidents, and 19 percent have been involved in fatal accidents. In 2008 and 2012, the FAA convened two safety groups specifically to address the airplane's \"unusually high accident and fatality rate compared to other amateur-built aircraft.\" The study noted that based on the statistics, the kit was involved in fatal accidents at \"a rate that is disproportionate to their fleet size.\" As a result of studies developed by these safety groups, the FAA acknowledged that accidents would continue to occur if no action was taken. Thus, the FAA issued a notice that Lancair pilots should \"review and thoroughly understand all information regarding stall characteristics and obtain specialized training regarding slow flight handling characteristics, stall recognition, and stall recovery techniques;\" install an angle-of-attack indicator to better predict a stall; and have their airplane evaluated by an experienced type-specific mechanic to ensure proper rigging, wing alignment, and weight and balance. The notice was recalled shortly after its release and another notice was released later to include other high-performance experimental amateur-built aircraft. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilots\u2019 inability to maintain control of the airplane and arrest a steep spiral dive while maneuvering for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident examination could not identify any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation prior to the inflight breakup.

Approximately 20 feet agl, engine power was lost and the helicopter impacted the ground.  A functional field check of the fuel system was conducted and it was noted that there was a leak in the breakaway valve, which would have allowed air to enter the system.  Further examination of the fuel boost pump and breakaway valve revealed that the O-rings were deteriorated.  The field inspection further revealed that the inlet shutoff valve arm on the fuel boost pump was bent.  According to the manufacturer's overhaul manual, if the inlet shutoff valve arm is bent it may prevent the valve from opening and restrict the fuel flow.  According to the component overhaul manuals, the O-ring seals in both the fuel boost pump and the fuel breakaway valve are not required to be inspected during routine inspections and are replaced as on-condition items.  A hydro leakage test and performance flow test check was conducted on the fuel boost pump with the original O-rings.  The fuel boost pump did not pass the manufacturer's tests.  The O-ring seals were replaced with new ones, and the fuel boost pump functioned within manufacturer's limits.  The fuel control unit and fuel pump were tested and no discrepancies were found.  The fuel nozzle was also tested and flowed within manufacturer's limits.  Maintenance records disclosed that the last time the fuel boost pump was worked on was 5 years prior to the accident. ",

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an IFR flight plan was filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 executive/corporate flight from The Florida Keys Marathon Airport (MTH), Marathon, Florida. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The airline transport pilot and co-pilot, 1 flight attendant, and 4 passengers were not injured, 1 passenger sustained serious injuries, and 1 passenger sustained minor injuries. The flight originated from MTH about 1554.The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that the landing dry and wet distances were calculated to be 3,166 and 4,166 feet, respectively. The flight departed MTH and while en route they obtained the MKY automated weather observing station (AWOS) which indicated the wind was from 250 degrees at 5 knots, and the visibility was 10 miles.The PIC further stated they reviewed the speeds (Vref of 133 knots), and planned a visual approach to runway 17. Air traffic control approved their request for a visual approach, and they changed to the common traffic advisory frequency, entering left downwind for runway 17. They slowed, lowered the flaps to 20 degrees, and noted rain 2 to 3 miles east of MKY, though the airport appeared to be dry. When the flight was abeam runway 17, the landing gear was lowered and the flaps were extended to 30 degrees. The landing checklist was performed (it was normal), and the anti-skid test was normal. The thrust reversers were armed, and he performed a \"teardrop turn\" to final. With flaps at 45 degrees, gear down, and flying Vref plus 10 knots, a couple of gusts were encountered during the approach. The co-pilot checked the AWOS again; the wind was still 250 degrees at 5 knots. He maintained a normal glide path at Vref plus 4 or 5 knots at the runway threshold, where he positioned both thrust levers to idle. The airplane was landed firm about 300 to 500 feet beyond the aiming point marking, and after touchdown he was unable to extend the ground spoilers. When the nose landing gear contacted the runway, he applied \"moderate\" brakes and held the control yoke forward, but felt no deceleration. He also attempted to deploy the thrust reversers but was unable.The PIC informed the co-pilot there was no braking energy and released the brakes; the anti-skid was turned off and the brakes were re-applied pressing hard. He did not feel any deceleration, and again tried to deploy the thrust reversers, but was unable. He kept the airplane on the runway centerline, and began modulating the brakes. Unable to stop the airplane he added right rudder input causing the airplane to veer to the right. The airplane went off the end of the runway into sand causing the nose landing gear to collapse. After coming to rest he ordered an emergency evacuation, and secured the engines.",

The pilot stated that \" it felt like I had no braking action and then felt the right side grab and brake, but not the left.\"  The combination of right side braking and the right low pitch system malfunction caused considerable adverse yaw, jerking the plane to the right.  The pilot applied power again and straightened the nose of the airplane.  He then made the decision to go around, but at this point did not have adequate airspeed or runway length to safely accomplish a go around.  He applied the brakes again, and the airplane immediately yawed to the right again, at which time the pilot was unable to compensate before the airplane caught the edge of the runway.

The pilot, the sole occupant on board, was not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to a private individual in Dakota Dunes, South Dakota, and operated by Aircraft Sales, Kansas City, Kansas, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight was originating at the time of the accident, and was destined for Miami County Airport (K81) Paola, Kansas.The pilot said the airplane was on consignment by the owner and he had been flying in and out of the rural agricultural airstrip, demonstrating the airplane to a prospective purchaser. On the accident flight, he departed solo to the north. After liftoff and about halfway down the 2,000-foot long dry grass runway at an altitude of 20 to 30 feet, \"it became evident\" power was insufficient as the airplane had stopped climbing. The airplane struck power lines at the north end of the runway and nosed down, impacting a cornfield.In a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board's duty officer, the pilot said he landed at the Random Ranch airstrip, located at 3400 W. 311th Coldwater Rd. Louisburg, Kansas. He shut down the engine and he and his passenger disembarked and conversed for a short period of time. The pilot then boarded the airplane, started the engine, and taxied to the south end of the airstrip. The pilot did not perform an engine run-up and did not use carburetor heat. The airplane lifted off the 2000-foot long runway before reaching the mid-point. Climb performance then stopped. He said the engine was turning but was not producing as much power. The nose was high and the pilot did not see the power lines. The airplane struck and severed the power lines and impacted terrain on the north end of the field.At the time of the accident, the temperature and dew point recorded at Johnson County Executive Airport (KOJC), Olathe, Kansas, located about 20 miles north of the accident site, were 28\u00b0 and 24\u00b0 Celsius (C.), respectively. Plotting these values on the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Special Aviation Information Bulletin (SAIB) CE-09-35 \"Carburetor Icing Prevention\" chart, the data point lies at the intersection of the blue (icing at glide and cruise power) and green (serious icing at glide power) envelopes. When asked about the possibility of carburetor ice, the pilot said he did not believe it was likely to have been a factor because the hot engine had been shut down for about 30 minutes and it only idled for a couple of minutes before takeoff.",

A bartender reported that about 5.5 hours prior to the accident, she served the pilot four alcoholic beverages, though he never appeared to be intoxicated.  The pilot and the two passengers left the bar together about 1 to 2 hours prior to the accident, and a designated driver transported them to the airport.  According to the designated driver, the pilot did not appear to be intoxicated.  A witness observed the airplane taxi past his hangar to the active runway and takeoff.  He reported that the airplane made erratic s-turns up the taxiway and also climbed out in an erratic manner.  According to the surviving passenger, who was in the front-right seat, after a 25-minute flight, the pilot made an approach to the airport and touched down over halfway down the runway.  The airplane landed hard and bounced back airborne, continuing down the runway about 2 to 3 feet above ground level (agl).  After reaching the end of the runway, the airplane touched back down on the surface.  The pilot attempted to abort the landing, but the airplane continued into the brush and impacted a dirt berm.  Post accident examinations of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures.  The FAA toxicological tests on the pilot's specimens found that the post-mortem blood ethanol level was 0.365 percent, with a post-mortem urine ethanol level at 0.357 percent.  Although there was evidence of putrefaction, careful analysis established that most of the ethanol found in the specimens was a result of ingestion, and at the time of the accident, the pilot's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was at or above 0.30 percent.  On his FAA application for a medical certificate, the pilot reported one Driving Under the Influence (DUI) conviction, which occurred over 5 years prior to the accident (2 years prior to submitting the application); the FAA medical records contained no details of that DUI, but review of the arrest records noted that the pilot's BAC was 0.28 percent during that arrest.  Review of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records indicated that the pilot actually had three additional convictions for drug and/or alcohol related offenses, including another DUI about 12 years prior to the accident.  The FAA specifically disqualifies pilot applicants with a history or clinical diagnosis of substance dependence, which is defined in 14 CFR 67.107, 67.207, and 67.307 as \"evidenced by (A) increased tolerance, (B) manifestation of withdrawal symptoms, (C) impaired control of use, or (D) continued use despite damage to physical health or impairment of social, personal, or occupational functioning.\"  The FAA additionally requires that airmen report any convictions involving driving while intoxicated or while under the influence of alcohol or a drug, and performs a National Driver Register (NDR) inquiry for each medical application to verify that all such convictions are in fact reported.  Because of individual state variances on the length of time convictions stay on record, and periodic purges of convictions by States from the NDR, the data in the NDR may not show all convictions for a specific individual.  The only national database that retains all convictions is the FBI's records.  The FAA only references FBI records for an applicant in the rare instance when credible information suggests that multiple unreported convictions may exist.  A senior legal attorney for the FAA reported that the agency does not have legal authority to routinely access FBI criminal records.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's misjudged distance and speed that led to a long landing, and his inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, all due to the effects of impairment from alcohol consumption, which resulted in an in-flight collision with terrain during an aborted landing attempt.

He reported encountering a heavy rain shower during taxi, with wind out of the south between 4-6 knots. The air traffic control tower cleared the pilot for a westbound departure; however, he elected to continue with a crosswind takeoff. The pilot applied left-wing-down aileron control inputs as he applied engine power. As the airplane accelerated, it began a drift to the left. The pilot reported that he was unable to stop the drift with the application of full right rudder, and that during this time he may have inadvertently relaxed the aileron control input. The pilot elected to abort the takeoff, and as he reduced engine power the right wing struck the water; the airplane incurred substantial damage to the wing spar and aileron during the impact sequence. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunction or failures.",

Examination of the airplane\u2019s nose gear assembly revealed the separation of the nose gear actuator attachment weld tube area (foot) of the motor mount. The metallurgical examination of fractured surface revealed fatigue crack emanating from multiple origins at the exterior of the joint where the attachment foot was welded to the support tube. The motor mount was a new design from the manufacturer which was to eliminate the concerns of fatigue separation of the weld in the foot area which was a problem with the old design motor mounts. The airplane had an annual inspection 36 flight hours prior to the accident. The new design motor mount does not have any specific inspection guidance during scheduled maintenance for identifying fatigue cracking in the actuator attach points. The old design motor mounts had detailed inspection instructions to detect fatigue cracking in the welds of the foot areas.",
