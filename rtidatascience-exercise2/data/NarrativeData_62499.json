The private pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local area flight that departed at 1900 from the pilot's private airstrip near Sidney, Illinois.The pilot reported that during cruise flight, about 1,200 feet mean sea level, the engine experienced a sudden and total loss of engine power. He was unsuccessful in reestablishing engine power and selected a nearby soybean field for a forced landing. The pilot stated that as he maneuvered the airplane toward the selected field, the setting sun temporarily obstructed his forward visibility and the airplane collided with power lines. He reported that following the collision with the power lines, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and impacted terrain with the left wing down. The airplane spun 180 degrees before coming to a stop in an upright attitude. The pilot and passenger unbuckled their seat restraints and exited the airplane uninjured.A postaccident examination of the airplane and its engine was performed by an aviation mechanic. The single fuel tank contained fuel and no anomalies were noted with its vented fuel cap. The engine produced suction/compression at each cylinder in conjunction with crankshaft rotation. Inspection of the spark plugs revealed features consistent with normal engine operation. Mechanical continuity was established between the cockpit engine controls and their respective engine components. An operational test run of the engine established the engine was capable of producing power. Following the operational test run, the intake and exhaust manifolds were removed to examine the pistons. The forward cylinder piston exhibited scoring and a lack of proper oil lubrication adjacent to the intake and exhaust ports. The rear cylinder piston did not exhibit scoring; however, evidence of oil starvation was observed. Further examination of the oil system revealed that the mechanical oil pump had seized within its housing. Additionally, the oil pump nylon drive-coupling had fractured. The oil pump was a non-serviceable component that prevented further disassembly.The pilot reported that the engine was not originally manufactured with an oil pump and that he had it modified with the oil pump about 50 hours before the accident.",

The right and left wing fuel tanks store fuel until the pilot transfers it into the center tank. Both the right and left fuel tanks have a transfer pump. To transfer fuel, the pilot turns on the transfer pump, and opens the fuel valve to allow fuel to flow from the left or/and right tank to the center tank.

About 250 feet above the water, the 90-degree gear box and tail rotor assembly separated.  The helicopter spiraled down toward the water, spinning to the right with an estimated 55- to 60-degree nose-down attitude.  The pilot reported the last moments before contacting the water were 'uncontrollable.'  The helicopter was recovered, except for the tail rotor system rotating components and gearbox.  The operator reported that he had removed the tail rotor abrasion strips from the blades during an annual inspection about 73 hours before the accident.

After the preflight inspection, the pilot taxied to the fuel pumps, where he topped off both fuel tanks.  The witness reported that the pilot had the flaps extended between \"5 and 10 degrees\" prior to takeoff.  The pilot taxied to runway 21, did an engine run-up, and began the takeoff roll.

The on-scene investigation revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have prevented the normal operation of the airplane or its systems.The airplane entered the severe convective weather; the pilot then requested and received clearance from the air traffic controller to initiate a turn to escape the weather. The airplane was lost from radar about 30 seconds after the pilot initiated the turn. Before the airplane entered the weather, the controller's radar scope depicted a band of moderate to extreme weather along the accident airplane's projected flightpath that was consistent with an embedded, heavy-precipitation, supercell-type thunderstorm; however, the controller did not provide the pilot with any severe weather advisories and did not advise the pilot of the weather depicted on his radar scope.Although Federal Aviation Administration directives state that controllers should give first priority to separating aircraft and issuing safety alerts, the directives further state that controllers should use good judgment and first perform the action that is most critical from a safety standpoint. Review of air traffic communications and radar data identified no air traffic control (ATC) radar limitations, no excessive traffic, no radio frequency congestion, and no controller workload issues that would have prevented the controller from issuing pertinent weather information to the accident pilot. On the basis of the controller's workload and available resources, he should have recognized that the adverse weather represented an immediate safety hazard to the accident flight and should have provided appropriate advisories to the pilot.The pilot obtained several weather briefings before departure. At that time, the current weather along the route of flight showed significant convective activity and a moving squall line, and the forecast predicted significant thunderstorm activity along the planned route of flight. The pilot also discussed the weather with an acquaintance, mentioning that he might need to work his way around some weather. On the basis of the weather information obtained by the pilot and his comments regarding the weather, the pilot was aware before departure that he would likely encounter adverse weather along the planned route of flight; however, by the time the airplane encountered the weather, the pilot had been airborne for over an hour and had not requested any updated weather information from air traffic controllers. The airplane was equipped with a BF Goodrich WX-950 Stormscope, which has some ability to depict the location and frequency of lightning strikes in the vicinity of the airplane; however, the investigation could not determine if and how this equipment may have been used during the flight. The airplane was not configured to display satellite weather information on its global positioning systems.In October 2006, the National Transportation Safety Board issued Safety Alert SA-11, \"Thunderstorm Encounters,\" as a result of this accident and three other fatal accidents that involved in-flight encounters with severe weather. The safety alert addresses ATC involvement in these accidents. The alert also states that IFR pilots need to actively maintain awareness of severe weather along their route of flight, and it provides suggestions to assist pilots in avoiding involvement in similar accidents.

He attempted to land on a road near the edge of the field he was spraying, but a tractor was on the road so he had to land in a crop of tall wheat. Just before touchdown, one of the aircraft's wings impacted the terrain, and during the landing roll on the soft terrain, the aircraft nosed over. During a post-accident teardown inspection it was determined that the torque sensor idler gear duplex bearing (part number 3103035-1) had failed, which is a condition that would normally result in an uncommanded in-flight shutdown of the engine. Further inspection of the bearing revealed only minimal heat stress discoloration and no clear lack of lubrication, but the bearing balls had been worn undersize, and the bearing cage had fractured into pieces. Further inspection of the bearing by Honeywell Mechanical Systems, revealed that the bearing condition was consistent with advanced rolling contact fatigue failure. As part of the investigation, an FAA Airworthiness Inspector determined that, \"The installation of the subject matched bearing set was performed properly by the last overhaul shop in accordance with the Allied-Signal (Honeywell) Overhaul Specification No. 72-00-17, revised July 20, 1992.\" Although the reason for the unexpected failure of this bearing after approximately 100 hours of operation could not be determined, it was noted that at the last overhaul, the Torque Sensor was not upgraded to the available -3 bearing, which uses a larger bearing assembly and a different gear set.",

During the forced landing, the right main landing gear separated from the fuselage after colliding with an irrigation ditch, and the airplane subsequently nosed over.\u000b\u000bA postaccident examination of the engine revealed a fatigue fracture of the No. 3 cylinder exhaust rocker housing. The measured release torque for the fractured No. 3 exhaust rocker assembly was at the upper limit of that specified by the manufacturer; however, the actual release torque before the failure was likely higher than when measured postaccident. Additionally, a majority of the other rocker assemblies had release torque measurements that exceeded the manufacturer\u2019s specified installation limits. Although the overhaul procedures used to assemble the rocker assemblies differed from the manufacturer\u2019s overhaul instructions, the investigation was unable to determine if those deviations would have resulted in excessive stress within the rocker housing. However, the investigation did conclude that the fatigue fracture was likely due to an excessive torque loading on the rocker assembly in conjunction with normal rocker operation.

As the pilot continued on toward the threshold of the sod runway, he attempted to maneuver toward its right side in order to avoid some stakes that were between him and the runway threshold, and in order to land well clear of the paved runway. Ultimately the aircraft touched down approximately 200 feet short of the sod runway threshold and 50 feet to the right of  its right edge. Although the initial touchdown in the tall weeds was uneventful, almost immediately after starting the landing roll, the aircraft impacted a ditch that the pilot had not been aware of.",
            "probable_cause": "The glider pilot's improper in-flight planning decision and his failure to attain the proper touchdown point.  Contributing to the accident were the inadvertent activation of the speed brakes, the pilot's failure to maintain altitude, the high vegetation and the ditch."

The private pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by Inline Aviation, LTD, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight that departed Litchfield Municipal Airport (3LF), Litchfield, Illinois, about 1855 and was destined for Aurora Municipal Airport (ARR), Sugar Grove, Illinois.According to preliminary air traffic control data, after departing 3LF, the flight proceeded on a direct course toward ARR and climbed to a cruise altitude of 7,500 feet mean sea level (msl). At 1954, the flight began a cruise-descent that continued until the end of available radar data at 2001. The pilot established radio communication with the Aurora Air Traffic Control Tower at 1951. The pilot was told to enter a left base for runway 27 and to report when the airplane was 2 miles from the airport. At 1959, the pilot reported being 10 miles from the airport and the tower controller asked the pilot to ident his transponder. The airplane was subsequently identified on radar at 1,800 feet msl. Available radar data indicated that the final radar return was recorded at 2001:59, about 0.4 miles southwest of the accident site, at 900 feet msl (about 250 feet above ground level).The airplane impacted several 30-foot tall trees located on a ridgeline measuring 645 feet msl. All airframe structural components and flight control surfaces were located along the wreckage debris path. Both wings and tailbooms separated from the fuselage during the collision with the trees. The fuselage was located 475 feet northeast of the ridgeline in a cornfield. All observed structural component failures were consistent with overstress separation and there was no evidence of an inflight or postimpact fire. Flight control continuity could not be established due to the extent of the damage; however, all observed flight control system discontinuities were consistent with overstress. The flaps and landing gear were found in a fully retracted position. The forward engine had separated from the fuselage and was located 90 feet northeast of the main wreckage. The rear engine remained partially attached to its firewall. Both propellers had separated from their respective engine crankshafts and exhibited S-shape spanwise bending, blade twisting, and leading edge damage.At 1952, the ARR automated surface observing system (ASOS) reported: calm wind, clear sky, 10 mile surface visibility, temperature 18 degrees Celsius, dew point 12 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.08 inches of mercury.",

The accident occurred as the pilot performed a simulated forced landing at the end of an instructional flight. The pilot began the landing flare above the region of ground effect and unintentionally induced an aerodynamic stall after his abrupt aft control yoke input. He increased engine power in response to the stall condition, but the airplane landed hard on the main landing gear in a nose-high attitude.

The airplane was crossing a VORTAC when the flight encountered turbulence the crew categorized as 'severe,' with a rapid right roll and pitch excursion.  The captain disconnected the autopilot and attempted to counter the excursions with control inputs.  As a result of the aircraft motions, 1 flight attendant sustained serious injuries, and another flight attendant and 13 passengers sustained minor injuries.  The airplane sustained minor damage, limited primarily to ceiling tiles and seats.  A review of the meteorological data showed no evidence of any atmospheric phenomena in the area.  A simulation study comparing the known airplane response to control inputs versus the motion of the airplane as recorded on the DFDR data showed that the flight controls alone did not cause the recorded motion of the airplane.  Radar data established that the flight was in trail of a MD-11 by 11.5 nmi and 97 seconds when the upset occurred.

The pilot stated that they had departed Burbank, California, en route to Gila Bend, Arizona, where they were going to refuel.  The pilot reported to FAA inspectors that he had fueled the airplane to it's 90-gallon capacity the day before the accident and had flown the airplane for 1 hour after that.  During the accident flight, the pilot had used a richer mixture to aid in cooling one cylinder.  He told the inspector that this may have led to a miscalculation of the fuel consumption during the flight.  As the flight neared the vacinity of Gila Bend, the pilot contacted Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and reported a low fuel situation and that he was going to land at Gila Bend for fuel.  The controller contacted the Gila Bend airport and determined that there was no fuel available there and suggested that the pilot should divert to another airport.  They then headed towards Buckeye Municipal Airport, but were later notified by ARTCC that Buckeye also did not have fuel.  At this time they diverted to the Phoenix Goodyear Airport and advised the tower that they were low on fuel and coming in to land.  As they approached the airport, the pilot switched fuel tanks but the airplane exhibited signs of fuel exhaustion.  The engine lost power, and the pilot landed in a plowed field about 1 mile from the airport.  Post accident inspection by FAA inspectors found no fuel onboard the airplane.  All fuel lines and tanks were intact.  The inspectors found no evidence of a fuel leak.  According to the Pilot's Operating Handbook, the Cessna T210L has a fuel capacity of 90 gallons; .5 gallons are unusable on each side.

The pilot switched to the front tank and after about 10 to 15 seconds, the engine restarted.  The engine ran smoothly for 15 to 20 seconds, then shut down again, with the fuel pressure reading zero.  The pilot attempted to use the hand-operated wobble pump to restore fuel pressure, but was not successful.  The pilot then performed a forced landing on what appeared to him to be the only suitable landing area, a high school football/baseball field.  The pilot stated that he skidded across the wet field and hit a 10- to 12-foot-high chain link fence straight on at about 30 to 35 MPH.  An FAA inspector reported that in a post-accident examination, anomalies with the fuel selector valve's operation were noted, namely, that \"The selector valve was found to be able to aspirate to an empty tank in two different ways.\"  The first condition was that  \"Using the wobble pump to create a suction in the supply-side line, slight inward pressure on the center of the valve would unseat the valve and the prime would be instantly lost.  It would be impossible to recover unless the valve was allowed to resume its' [sic] original position.\"  Second, the inspector reported that \"With this particular valve it was possible to create enough suction in the selected off position, or in between position, to unseat the valve and cause aspiration to occur.\"  The inspector stated that the condition was repeatable (to a lesser degree) with a newly overhauled valve.",

An emergency evacuation was made during which time the emergency evacuation slide on the 2 left (2L) door failed to deploy.  The captain reported that during the initial takeoff run, he held half forward pressure until reaching 80 knots.  He reported that up to this point, everything was normal.  He stated he released forward stick pressure by about 100 knots and the nose of the airplane began lifting off the ground with neutral stick, which was not normal.  He reported he applied about half forward stick and the nose came back down.  He reported that at 120 knots the nose again began to rise with one half to one quarter stick input.  He then pushed the stick forward to the forward stop and the nose came up at a rapid rate.  The captain reported that his attention was focused outside the airplane and he did not hear the first officer call V1.  He reported that he felt the airplane was going to stall so he pulled the power off and aborted the takeoff.  The captain stated that he was trained not to perform high-speed aborted takeoffs, but he felt the airplane would have been uncontrollable if the takeoff continued.  The captain stated the thrust reversers were deployed and he initially thought there was enough runway remaining to stop.  He assumed the autobrakes activated, but he pressed on the brakes anyway.  He reported the airplane was not decelerating and it departed the end of the runway at a high speed.  The captain reported that deceleration was rapid once the airplane departed the paved surface and the engines flamed out during the ground roll.  Post accident inspection of the airplane revealed the horizontal stabilizer trim was set to negative 1.7 (units of trim), when it should have been set at positive 1.7.  The first officer stated he set the trim while on the taxiway.  The captain did not notice the improper trim setting during the cross check which was part of the taxi checklist.  Further investigation revealed the operator procedures were to set the trim using units instead of percentage of mean aerodynamic chord as recommended by the manufacturer.  In addition, it was discovered that the manner in which the units of trim were displayed on the trim control wheel, on the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring system (ECAM), and in the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) were not consistent.  As a result the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendations A-02-06 and A-02-07.  Post accident examination of the 2L slide/raft that did not deploy revealed an improper chamfer on the telescopic girt bar which attaches the slide/raft to the airplane structure.  This allowed the slide/raft to detach from the airplane when the 2L door was opened.   As a result the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendations A-01-27 and A-01-28.  Being a fly-by wire airplane, the Airbus A320 has two sources of control lag in the pitch control.  One is the latency between the pilot's input and the elevator movement through the elevator aileron control (ELAC) computer and the other is the rate limit of the elevator.  Examination of the digital flight data recorded data for this accident revealed the pilot changed the pitch input faster than the elevator system would respond and saturation occurred in the rate at which the elevator surface could respond to the inputs.  This resulted in pilot inducted oscillations (PIO) during the takeoff roll.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot induced oscillations and the delay in aborting the takeoff.  Factors associated with the accident were the first officer used an improper trim setting and the captain did not identify and correct the setting during the taxi checklist, and the wet runway conditions."

An FAA inspector who traveled to the site said a witness told him that the airplane had just completed a loop when it rolled abruptly to the left and dove into the ground.  The inspector said the airplane impacted the ground in a near vertical attitude.  Additional witnesses told the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), that the pilot/owner typically performed single aerobatic maneuvers at 800-1,000 feet above the ground.  One witness told the IIC that she saw the airplane descending in a spiral, as she had seen before, but the spiral was tighter and faster than before.  She said the pilot did not pull out at the usual height, and descended below the trees.  The first person to the accident site was a student pilot and friend of the accident pilot.  He said he and his wife watched the accident airplane perform a loop and then enter a counter-clockwise spin at the bottom of the loop.  A postcrash fire consumed most of the airplane.  During the on-site examination, the FAA inspector found the right cable attachment point to the rudder horn had fractured, and the cable was disconnected.  The rudder horn assembly was sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for analysis.  The analysis disclosed that prior to the fracture, the outboard portion of the horn, where the cable was attached, was bent downward almost perpendicular to its normal plane of rotation.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The non-instrument-rated private pilot/owner of the airplane had longstanding arrangements for the trip to his destination, which was about 500 miles east of where he lived and based his airplane. He originally planned to depart on Thursday morning, but instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) at the airport prevented him from leaving on Thursday or Friday. On Saturday morning, IMC still prevailed. Several witnesses observed the pilot and his son at the fuel dock, and all assumed that he would then taxi back to his hangar since the ceilings were between 200 and 400 feet above ground level. Instead, the airplane departed and disappeared from view into the overcast clouds. The pilot initially squawked the visual flight rules (VFR) code of 1200 on his transponder, but then contacted an air traffic controller for flight advisories. The controller assigned a discrete transponder code, and instructed the pilot to maintain VFR. For the next 7 minutes, multiple witnesses on and near the airport heard the airplane in their vicinity. All reported that it sounded like the airplane was continuously changing speed, direction, or both. Several witnesses then heard the airplane impact the ground. Airplane components were found in two locations:  at the main wreckage site and along a debris path that consisted of the outboard portions of the left wing and left stabilator. Physical evidence indicated that the wing failed in the positive direction due to airloads and not due to any preseparation mechanical deficiencies. No other evidence of any preimpact component deficiencies or failures was discovered and examination of the wreckage and ground scars indicated that the engine was developing power at impact. Discussions with the pilot's wife revealed that he occasionally flew into or through clouds, albeit usually for short durations, in order to begin or complete his flights. In the case of the accident flight, the pilot had already delayed his departure 2 days, so he was highly motivated to begin the trip. Although the departure airport conditions were IMC, the pilot was aware that the forecast called for improved conditions towards his destination. In addition to his prior VFR operations into IMC, he did not hold a valid medical certificate and no current record of a required transponder inspection was located.Ground-based radar and onboard global positioning system (GPS) data revealed that the airplane flew a ground track that included about eight 360-degree turns and three 180-degree turns, and that its altitude varied continuously between 200 feet and 1,600 feet above mean sea level. The GPS and radar data clearly indicated that the pilot became disoriented and was unable to methodically and safely extract himself from his predicament. FAA guidance regarding VFR flight into IMC cautioned pilots to minimize attitude changes and obtain appropriate assistance, including use of the autopilot.",
            "probable_cause": "The non-instrument-rated pilot's decision to depart into known instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in his spatial disorientation and overcontrol of the airplane and the subsequent in-flight structural failure. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to use all available resources, including the autopilot and the air traffic controller."

Weather in the vicinity of the airport was less than 3 miles visibility with overcast clouds at 300 feet above ground level. The overcast layer extended from 300 feet to 2,600 feet. Aircraft flight data was recovered from a handheld GPS unit that was onboard the airplane. The data disclosed that the airplane climbed to 412 feet mean sea level (msl) on a northerly heading, then entered a climbing left-hand turn that tightened into a climbing spiral. The airplane reached 1,350 feet msl before entering a rapid spiraling descent and colliding with a vacation home about 1 mile northwest of the airport. These GPS flight track data suggested that the pilot may have become spatially disoriented during the initial climb.A post impact fire destroyed the house and airplane. The pilot held an instrument airplane rating; however, a review of his personal flight records was unable to establish that he was current with his instrument flight experience. The majority of the airplane was destroyed by the post impact fire. In the small portions of wreckage that could be examined, no mechanical anomalies were identified.Post-accident toxicology testing detected a low level of zolpidem, a prescription sleep aid often known by the trade name Ambien, in the blood of the pilot. The source from which the blood sample was taken was not documented, however, and no conclusive determinations can be made regarding when the pilot may have last used the medication or whether he may have been impaired by its use.

The pilot replied \u201cno,\u201d and stated that the weather \u201clooked good\u201d; however, at that time, the weather at the destination airport included visibility of 2 miles and a 400-foot overcast ceiling. The pilot proceeded on the approximate 1-hour night flight to the destination airport in low IFR conditions. During the instrument landing system approach, the pilot flew about 1 mile right of and 900 feet below the final approach fix. The tower controller issued a low altitude alert and instructed the pilot to check his altitude. The pilot acknowledged the instruction and confirmed that the airplane\u2019s altitude was 600 feet, which was the altitude indicated on radar. He then flew the airplane left of the final approach course twice before intercepting it a third time, descending to 300 feet, and then reporting  that he was going to conduct a missed approach.\u000b\u000bThe published missed approach procedure was to climb to 700 feet and then to make a climbing right turn to 1,900 feet on a 180-degree heading. However, the tower controller instructed the pilot to fly a heading of 280 degrees, and the pilot acknowledged the instruction. The controller did not provide an altitude and was not required to do so. After the pilot acknowledged the instruction, the airplane made a climbing left turn to 900 feet before radar and radio communications were lost. The airplane subsequently descended and collided with a retaining pond near the last recorded radar target. Although the tower controller\u2019s issuance of nonstandard missed approach instructions without specifying an altitude might have added to the pilot\u2019s workload, radar data show an initial turn consistent with the instructions and an associated climb indicating that the nonstandard instructions were not a factor in the accident. Examinations of the airplane and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation, and there was no evidence of medical impairment that would have affected the pilot\u2019s performance. \u000b\u000bGiven the night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) with restricted visibility and the sustained left turn and climb, it is likely the pilot experienced spatial disorientation. The investigation could not determinate the pilot\u2019s overall and recent experience in actual IMC; however, his inability to align the airplane with both the final approach fix\u2019s lateral and vertical constraints is consistent with a lack of instrument proficiency.

The 1,834-hour pilot stated that en route, the engine performance \"appeared normal,\" however, he stated that  Air Traffic Control  communications became difficult.  He reported to have had intermittent radio trouble with Air Route Traffic Control Center and Approach Control.  The pilot contacted Flight Service Station and obtained a frequency for the Regional Approach Control.  He received a new frequency, squawk and an assigned heading and altitude.  The pilot reported that he experienced intermittent radio contact and heard a loud \"buzzing\" noise in his headset.  At this time, the fuel gages \"showed\" a sudden change, indicating low fuel.  The pilot announced to Regional Approach Control (in the blind) that he had lost radio contact and would proceed directly to T67, in accordance with the flight plan.  The pilot configured the airplane for an approach to Runway 32.  As he continued the approach, he stated that he visually confirmed that the flaps were extended but the landing gear had not fully extended.  The pilot elected to initiate a go-around.  He \"pushed\" all of the power controls forward, however he heard the engine \"sputter\" and reported that it did not produce enough power to induce a positive rate of climb.  An examination of the airplane revealed that the landing gear was found in the retracted position, and the landing gear control switch was found in the gear down position.   The battery was removed and a gravity test was performed.  The results were that the battery was \"dead.\"  The alternator was removed, tested for function, and passed.  A total of 31.5 gallons of fuel was removed from the aircraft.  The mixture control was found halfway between the full-rich and cut-off position.  The owner stated \"the engine roughness was due to the pilot's failure to push the mixture control to the full-rich position prior to the approach/landing.\"",

Toward the end of the checkride, the private pilot had completed single-engine maneuvers, including a simulated single-engine instrument approach to a full-stop landing. The private pilot believed that the only remaining maneuvers to be completed were a short-field landing and emergency descent. During the final approach for a short-field landing, the examiner simulated a right engine failure. The private pilot feathered the right propeller, but thought that the examiner may have \"bumped it out of feather and set it to zero thrust.\" Shortly thereafter, the private pilot realized that the airplane was not going to reach the runway, and attempted a go-around. When power was increased on both engines, the airplane started to turn left. The private pilot then noticed that the left propeller speed was decreasing. The examiner took control of the airplane, reduced power on both engines, and landed in a grass field.

The pilot had previously flown another similar model airplane, but it was slightly older and had a different avionics package; the new airplane\u2019s avionics and flight management system were new to the pilot. After completing the ferry flight and dropping off the passengers, the pilot departed for a short cross-country flight in the airplane.

The pilot acknowledged the transmission and indicated that he would turn to a 045 heading. The radio transmission sounded routine, and no concern was noted in the pilot\u2019s voice. However, an audio tone consistent with the airplane\u2019s stall warning horn was heard in the background of the pilot\u2019s radio transmission.
