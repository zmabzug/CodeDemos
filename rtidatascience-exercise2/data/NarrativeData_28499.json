The training jet was returning to its home military base after a training flight.  The training jet had climbed VFR to 5,500 feet msl, and then was instructed to descend to 5,000 feet msl on a 100 degree magnetic heading.  After about a minute or less of level flight at 5,000 feet msl, the T-37B impacted the agricultural aircraft which was flying on a heading of about 355 to 005 degrees magnetic.  The radar approach control facility that was providing radar services to the T-37B did not have radar recording capability, therefore, no radar track data was available for analysis.  Air traffic controllers who were working the T-37B reported seeing the T-37B at 5,000 feet on their radar displays prior to the mid-air collision.

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The pilot stated that during a nonprecision approach while two miles from the runway, he observed it to be completely covered in snow and slush.  He continued the approach and upon touchdown the airplane decelerated in deep slush and veered to the left after a rollout of 1,200 feet.  The pilot reported that prior to accepting the emergency medical flight, he obtained a weather briefing from a flight service station during which time no notices to airman (NOTAMs) existed that pertained to the destination airport.  The pilot reported that he knew the airport was getting rain and was expecting the runway to be clear.  He was surprised that the runway was covered with heavy slush.

Airport management is responsible for observing and reporting the condition of airport movement areas.  Public notification is usually accomplished through the NOTAM system.  The Aeronautical Information Manual, states that NOTAM information is information that could affect a pilot's decision to make a flight.  It includes information such as airport or primary runway closures, changes in the status of navigational aids, ILS's, radar service availability, and other information essential to planned en route, terminal, or landing operations.

The airplane descended and struck a multiple family dwelling.  Examination of the wreckage revealed the outboard wing panels had separated from the airplane in flight due to downward bending forces that occurred after the in-flight separation of the horizontal stabilizer.  The horizontal stabilizer was found next to the vertical stabilizer apart from the main fuselage and wing wreckage and had separated, in-flight, in a horizontal twisting motion that pushed the left tip of the horizontal stabilizer rearward.  An impact mark on the left outboard leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer was consistent with a soft bodied impact that occurred prior to ground impact.   Although one witness reported seeing several birds flying in the area at the time of the accident, examination of the left horizontal stabilizer and elevator failed to find any evidence of blood, feathers, or bird remains.  A detailed and comprehensive examination of the accident site area failed to reveal any evidence of a bird carcass, or bird feathers.  Aircraft components composed of both aluminum and fiberglass were mounted forward of the empennage, however the impact mark showed no residual evidence of being struck by either material. A determination of the source of the soft bodied impact could not be made.  The vertical stabilizer is attached to the horizontal stabilizer, and this assembly is then attached to the fuselage through four attach points. The damage to the vertical stabilizer attach points indicates that they failed toward the left (as viewed from the rear looking forward) and were securely attached to the horizontal stabilizer at the time of failure. Three of the four bolts that attach the horizontal stabilizer to the fuselage were recovered. The forward two attach points were torn out of the horizontal stabilizer during the in-flight separation.

The controller then called out the landing traffic on final, which was an Airbus A300-600 heavy airplane. The flight crew replied that they had the traffic in sight, and the controller cleared the flight to land behind the Airbus, and to be cautious of wake turbulence. The flight crew observed the Airbus abeam their current position and estimated that they made their base turn about 3 miles from the runway. Before turning onto final approach, the flight crew discussed wake turbulence avoidance procedures and planned to make a steeper approach and land beyond the Airbus\u2019s touchdown point.

The pilot of the Piper aircraft, which was transmitting mode C transponder data the entire time it was under the radar service of TLH ATCT, was advised by the controller to turn to a heading of 090 degrees. At that time, the flight was located approximately 12 miles north of KTLH, the intended destination airport. Approximately one minute later, the same controller assigned the pilot of the Cessna, not transmitting mode C data, a heading of 090 degrees as he was climbing out from an airport located just north of KTLH. Radar data indicates that the controller subsequently put the two aircraft on converging flight paths. The controller then instructed the pilot of the Piper to descend to three thousand feet and turn to a heading of 120 degrees. Shortly after these instructions were given, the pilot of the Cessna stated to the controller that he had just had a mid air collision with another aircraft.  Both aircraft landed at KTLH without further incident. Both pilots later reported they did not see the other before or at the time of the impact.  The controller did not provide traffic advisories or safety alerts required in class C airspace to either aircraft before the collision.

As the pilot aligned the airplane with the runway, he noticed 'snow fingers' across the runway so he planned his touchdown between the centerline and the right side of the runway.

According to the Beech Aircraft Corporation, the maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the Beech 35-B33 is 17 knots.  This would produce a crosswind component of about 17 knots and a headwind component about 10 knots.

Shortly after making this announcement, a witness said he saw the airplane takeoff downwind on runway 36. Witnesses near the airport said they saw the airplane at a low altitude as it was climbing onto a downwind leg.  One witness said the airplane was about 100 to 200-feet above the trees when it suddenly '...dropped nose down into the trees.'  The on-scene investigation revealed the pusher propeller had a blade root angle set to 43-degrees at the hub. The propeller manufacturer said the blade angle for the propeller should normally be between seven and 14-degrees at its tip.  With a 43-degree angle at the blade's root, the blade's tip angle would be about 20.5-degrees, according to the manufacturer's representative.   No anomalies with the engine, airframe or flight control system were observed that would prevent flight. ",

Following a planned fuel stop at an FAA tower controlled airport, the pilot was cleared for takeoff to the west. During the initial climb, witnesses reported hearing the airplane's engine sputter, backfire, and then lose power about 200-300 feet above the ground. They saw the airplane make a steep left turn toward an intersecting north-south runway that the airplane had just passed. During the steep turn, the witnesses said the airplane remained in a nose high attitude, stalled, and then descended steeply, colliding with a building just outside the airport boundary fence. A postcrash fire consumed most of the airplane.  The pilot and passenger died in the crash. An FAA tower controller reported that he gave the pilot instructions for a right turn on departure, and when he saw the airplane make a left turn he asked the pilot's intentions. The pilot replied that his engine was out, and the controller cleared him to land on any runway. Prior to departure, a witness saw the pilot fuel the airplane, and after fueling, the pilot entered the airplane without checking the fuel tank sumps for water or contamination. The witness said the airplane taxied to the runway, but did not stop before entering the runway, and starting the takeoff. Inspections of the wreckage and engine did not disclose any preimpact mechanical anomalies, however, the fuel tanks and contents were consumed by fire, and the magnetos had impact damage and could not be tested. The fuel tank selector was examined, and found in the right tank position, and free of obstructions. Tests conducted with a similar airplane disclosed that the engine would stop between 3 and 4 minutes if the fuel selector was positioned in either the OFF position or at a setting between the tanks. According to the tower transcripts, the total elapsed time from the request to taxi with the engine running until the report of the engine power loss was 3 minutes and 12 seconds. While the loss of engine power may be attributable to the improper positioning of the fuel selector, the inability to examine the airplane\u2019s fuel and ignition systems for deficiencies due to damage cannot rule out either an ignition problem or fuel contamination. However, the pilot\u2019s decision to attempt a steep turn toward an intersecting runway at such a low altitude following the loss of engine power, likely resulted in an aerodynamic stall, loss of control, and a nonsurvivable crash.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power during takeoff/initial climb for an undetermined reason, and the pilot's decision to make an abrupt and steep low altitude turn toward an intersecting runway, resulting in an aerodynamic stall and loss of aircraft control."

The pilot was performing the takeoff, while the instructor called out airspeeds and directed his attention inside and outside the cockpit. Passing 80 mph, the instructor maintained his vision outside the cockpit. The pilot felt the airplane 'hit a few dips in the runway' and both pilots heard a 'loud bang' from the right side and the flight instructor took command of the flight. Control was lost and the airplane veered left, crossed a taxiway and skidded into a ditch, where the airplane stopped. The instructor reported that the pilot's hand was on the throttles during the takeoff roll; however, once the 80 mph airspeed callout was made, he was not aware of the position of the pilot's hand. The pilot recalled having moved his hand to the trim; however, he 'did not remember touching the gear' selector switch.

The oil began coating the windscreen and made forward visibility nearly impossible as the pilot initiated an off-airport landing in an adjacent open field.  During the landing roll, the airplane struck a barbed wire fence and came to rest on a two-lane highway, which resulted in substantial damage to the right wing and engine firewall.  A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the crankshaft was cracked about 380 to 400 degrees around the circumference of the forward bearing journal, originating from the oil-through hole and progressing in a direction opposite of the rotation of the crankshaft.  A metallurgical examination of the fracture region revealed that the origin of the fracture was consistent with a brittle intergranular fracture through the nitride layer and exhibited numerous crack arrest marks.  Beyond the fatigue fracture area, the fracture was on a slant plane consistent with overstress separation.  The source of the loading that lead to the initial crack formation at the oil through-hole could not be determined.

The accident site is in level desert terrain approximately the same elevation as the airport.  Impact marks and transfers disclosed that the aircraft contacted a steel and concrete power pole and associated static and transmission lines with the left wing, center windshield post, and vertical stabilizer.  Investigation revealed that the pilot and passenger had consumed alcoholic beverages during dinner together at a local restaurant the night of the accident.  Following dinner, the pair were observed to consume other alcoholic beverages at a party.  The airplane then departed from the airport, where the airplane is based, at an unknown time for a presumed local flight.  An airborne witness was piloting an emergency medical services helicopter (based at the airport), which was returning from a mission and inbound to the airport from the south.  He observed the position lights of the accident airplane approach the airport from the west through a pass, which crosses the mountains between the valley where the airport is located and the greater Las Vegas metropolitan area.  The position lights were roughly at the same elevation as his helicopter, 4,000 feet msl.  He attempted to contact the airplane on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency, but got no response.  As he continued inbound to the airport, he monitored the position of the airplane and saw it on a wide arcing flight path to the south of the airport.  As he was beginning a final descent to land at their parking spot, the airplane's pilot came on the CTAF and announced that he was going to make a \"teardrop approach\" to runway 27 left.  The witness said the pilot's voice had an unusual and strange quality and that the comment about a teardrop approach confused him momentarily because he knew that there was no such instrument approach to the airport.  He then observed the airplane continue the wide arcing and descending left-hand flight path to runway 27.  The witness had landed and was shutting the helicopter down when he looked up and observed the navigation lights of the airplane on final approach.  He thought to himself that the airplane was very low, then he saw the bright flash of arcing electricity as the airplane contacted the power lines.  The power lines contacted by the airplane are the most eastern of four sets of high tension power lines running perpendicular to the approach end of the runway.  The pole and lines contacted by the airplane were 66 feet above ground level and on the extended runway centerline.  The most western set of the three power line sets were marked by red obstruction lights.  The sky was clear and the winds calm, with no moon visible.  The airport's runway and approach lights were functioning.  The airport is located on the south side of the city and, for an airplane on final approach, the airport lights would be the only ground reference lights visible.  No pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures were identified with the airplane or engine.

The pilot was fatally injured and the passenger was seriously injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, with no flight plan filed. The flight departed from LRU about 1040 and was destined for El Paso International Airport (ELP), El Paso, Texas.  About 5 minutes after departing from LRU, the passenger stated the engine lost partial power and the pilot initiated a return back to LRU. The pilot subsequently executed a forced landing into uneven terrain about one-half mile prior to the Runway 30 threshold at LRU, which damaged both wings and fuselage. The pilot was airlifted to a regional hospital, but passed away on August 17, 2015. At 1055, the weather observation station at LRU reported the following conditions: wind 080 degrees at 3 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear skies, temperature 30 degrees C, dew point 12 degrees C, altimeter setting 30.26 inches of mercury.",

The pilot originally had filed an IFR flight plan the night before his proposed departure and also obtained a weather briefing.  The weather information contained in the briefing was substantially correct.  He was delayed due to fog from his estimated time of departure and never refiled or opened the flight plan.  CAP search aircraft located the wreckage 1 week after the accident.  The aircraft was found at the 11,760-foot level of a mountain and about 1,000 feet below the peak.

Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC), Kansas City, Missouri.  The airplane was operated by a commercial operator as a positioning flight to Kansas City International Airport (MCI), Kansas City, Missouri, with a filed alternate destination of Lincoln Airport (LNK), Lincoln, Nebraska.  Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  LNK was a certificated airport with a snow removal plan and was served by runway 17R (12,901 feet by 200 feet, grooved asphalt and concrete).  The flight was en route to MCI to pick up passengers and continue on as an on-demand charter but diverted to MKC following the closure of MCI.  MCI was closed due to a McDonnell Douglas MD83 sliding off a taxiway during an after landing taxi on contaminated runway/taxiway conditions.  MKC held a limited airport certificate that did not have a snow removal plan and was served by runway 19.  Following a precision approach and landing on runway 19 at MKC, the Learjet 35A slid off the departure end of the runway and impacted airport property and terrain.  The Learjet 35A was operated with inoperative thrust reversers as per the airplane's minimum equipment list at the time of the accident.  About 1:05 hours before the accident, runway 19 Tapley values were recorded as 21-22-22 with 1/2 inch of wet snow.  About 17 minutes before the accident, MKC began snow removal operations.  About 7 minutes before the accident, the MKC air traffic control tower (TWR) instructed the snow removal vehicles to clear the runway for inbound traffic.  TWR was advised by airport personnel that runway 19 was plowed and surface conditions were 1/4 inch of snow of snow; friction values were not taken or reported.  While inbound, the Learjet 35A requested any braking action reports from TWR.  The first airplane to land was a Cessna 210 Centurion, and the pilot reported braking action to the TWR as \"moderate\", which was then transmitted by TWR as \"fair\" from a Centurion in response to the Learjet 35A's query.  The Cessna 210 Centurion pilot did not use brakes during landing and did not indicate this to TWR during his braking action report.  The Aeronautical Information Manual states that no correlation has been established between MU values and the descriptive terms \"good,\" fair,\" and \"nil\" used in braking action reports.  The Airport Winter Safety and Operations advisory circular (AC) states that \"pilot braking action reports oftentimes have been found to vary significantly, even when reported on the same frozen contaminant surface conditions.\"  The AC also states, \"It is generally accepted that friction surveys will be reliable as long as the depth of snow does not exceed 1 inch (2.5 cm) and/or depth of wet snow/slush does not exceed 1/8 inch (3mm).  The Learjet 35A flightcrew calculated a landing distance 5,400 feet.  Two of the cockpit voice recording channels, which normally contain the pilot and copilot audio panel information, were blank.",

Contributing factors were the operation of the airplane without thrust reversers, flight to the planned alternate airport not performed by the flightcrew, and the insufficient runway information.

The purpose of the aerial survey flight was to provide a California Department of Forestry passenger with an aerial mapping opportunity around active fire areas in the Lassen National Park.  The pilot indicated that his specific mission on the flight was to maneuver the helicopter over a route that would provide the front seat passenger an opportunity to accurately mark global positioning satellite (GPS) waypoints around the fire area.  Initially, the pilot flew at 6,500 feet mean sea level (msl), but when the passenger started marking waypoints, the pilot descended to 5,500 feet msl.  The pilot further indicated that during the flight he made several turns.  Just prior to the crash, he flew in a southerly, and then a northerly direction.  When he next turned, to an east-southeasterly direction, he raised the collective, observed his proximity to the fire line, and directed his attention to a hill that he was approaching.  The pilot indicated that he had expected to be higher than the top of the hill, but he was lower.  At this time, despite his efforts to increase altitude, the helicopter impacted trees and terrain.  According to ground-based witnesses, the helicopter had been maneuvering between 50 and 75 feet above ground level, in a downwind direction, over 5,100-foot mean sea level upsloping terrain, toward the crest of the mountain.  The surface wind was from the north-northeast, about 10 knots.  The temperature was almost 90 degrees Fahrenheit.  The witnesses further reported that the helicopter's engine was operating until it impacted trees, about 20 feet beneath the mountain crest.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate clearance from objects and terrain while maneuvering at low altitude.  Factors in the accident were the high, rising terrain, and the high density altitude."

Before departure, the pilot asked a person, who also became an eyewitness to the accident, to monitor the radio and document information regarding the test flight transmitted by the pilot. During the preflight briefing, the pilot told the witness that part of the flight would include doing an \"approach to stall.\" The pilot topped off the 5-gallon fuel tank and departed for an estimated 30-minute flight. The witness observed the airplane maneuvering near the airport, and the pilot made several transmissions to him. The witness said the airplane entered a high downwind (approximately 2,000-3,000 feet above the ground). He observed the airplane slow to a nose high attitude while maintaining altitude. Then, while maintaining the same pitch attitude, a constant loss of altitude occurred with the wings level for approximately 3 to 4 seconds. He heard no increase in engine power nor was the airplane's pitch angle reduced. There appeared to be an abrupt entry into a right spin, and 6 to 8 turns were observed with a nearly vertical impact with the ground.

The flightcrew then reported that they had the runway in sight, cancelled their instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance, and executed a visual flight rules (VFR) approach in VFR conditions to the airport.  The reported winds favored a landing toward the east, onto the opposite runway (runway 6).   During the approach, after a query from the first officer, the captain indicated to the first officer that he was going to \"...land to the east,\" consistent with the reported winds.  However, the final approach and subsequent landing were made to runway 24, which produced a six-knot tailwind. During the approach sequence the captain maintained an airspeed that was approximately 30 knots higher than the correct airspeed for the aircraft's weight, resulting in the aircraft touching down about 1,500 feet further down the runway than normal, and much faster than normal.  The captain then delayed the initiation of a go-around until the first officer asked if they were going around. Although the aircraft lifted off the runway surface prior to departing the paved overrun during the delayed go-around it impacted a localizer antenna platform, whose highest non-frangible structure was located approximately 304 feet past the end of the runway, and approximately two feet lower than the terrain at the departure end of the runway. The aircraft continued airborne as it flew over downsloping terrain for about 400 more feet before colliding with the terrain and a commercial storage building that was located at an elevation approximately 80 feet lower than the terrain at the end of the runway.  The localizer antenna platform was located outside of the designated runway safety area, and met all applicable FAA siting requirements.  The captain had type 2 diabetes, for which he took oral medication and monitored blood sugar levels.  He did not reveal his history of diabetes to the FAA.  The captain's post-accident toxicology testing was consistent with an elevated average blood sugar level over the previous several months; however, no medical records of the captain's treatment were available, and the investigation could not determine if the captain's diabetes or treatment were potentially factors in the accident.  The captain of the accident flight was the sole owner of a corporation that was asked by the two owners of the accident airplane to manage the airplane for them under a Part 91 business flight operation.  The two owners were not pilots and had no professional aviation experience, but they desired to be flown to major domestic airports so that they could transfer and travel internationally via commercial airlines.  One of the two owners stated that the purpose of the accident flight was to fly a businessman to a meeting, and to also transport one of the owner's wives to visit family at the same destination. According to one of the owners, the businessman was interested in being a third owner in the accident airplane, so the owner permitted the businessman to fly.  The owner also stated that the accident pilot told him that the passenger would pay for expenses directly related to the operation of the airplane for the flight (permitted under FAA Part 91 rules), and an \"hourly fee\" (prohibited under FAA Part 91 rules); however, no documentation was found to corroborate this statement for the accident flight or previous flights.",

The three passengers were employees of an environmental services company that was contracted to conduct aerial surveys of marine mammals. Each month, the pilot re-positioned the airplane from his base in Massachusetts to New Jersey to conduct the survey flights. The previous month, the survey personnel documented concerns with the pilot's performance, and the condition of the airplane. For the accident flight series, the pilot arrived 1 1/2 days late, and one surveyor documented the passengers' concerns about the pilot's performance and fatigue. About 90 minutes into the accident flight, the pilot informed the passengers that he \"was having some fuel problems,\" terminated the survey, and diverted for a precautionary landing. One passenger saw the front propeller stop and begin rotation more than once. The airplane impacted trees and terrain approximately 400 feet to the side of the runway threshold.

He and the first officer performed a briefing for the localizer 30 approach to Miami International Airport, prior to beginning descent. During landing on runway 30, the airplane floated for a while before touchdown, after the first officer flared for landing. After a few seconds, he, the captain, took control of the airplane during the landing roll. It appeared the airplane would over run the runway and collide with an approach light structure. The captain steered the airplane to the left side of the runway and brought it to a complete stop with the nose wheel in a sandy area. He shutdown the engines and deplaned the passengers. The airplane was then towed to the gate. Readout of the digital flight data recorder showed the decent from cruise  flight to 10, 000 feet appeared normal and at 10,000 feet the airplane maintained 250 knots airspeed.

This discrepancy resulted in a loss of available boost pressure and significantly reduced the available power. The most recent annual inspection of the airplane was completed 3 years before the accident, and, 5 months before the accident, the pilot requested that the local maintenance facility draft a list of discrepancies that would require correction in order to return the airplane to an airworthy condition.

The private pilot called his flight instructor to assist him on the cross-country flight. The mechanic stated that the flight instructor came to his residence to pick up his flight bag at 0200 shortly after returning from a concert. The mechanic asked if he needed any assistance in preparing for the flight to Florida, and the flight instructor replied that the private pilot prepared everything for the cross-country flight. That was the last conversation the mechanic had with the flight instructor. According to a witness a helicopter was heard flying over the residential area, and shortly afterward an explosion was heard. Witnesses searched the area, and a helicopter was located in the back of a residential home engulfed in flames. . Examination of the wreckage site revealed the helicopter rested approximately 25 yards behind a residential home. The wreckage path was approximately 35 feet in length on a northerly heading at the base of a tree. The tail boom section was broken, and buckled. The main rotor blades were buckled and separated from the main rotor mass. The tail rotor shaft was separated from the tail boom and lodge in a tree.

During the accident flight, he performed touch-and-go landings and then went to an aerobatic area to perform flight maneuvers. During the maneuvers, he noted that the oil pressure was initially 65 to 70 psi, dropped to about 40 psi, and returned to 70 psi when the airplane was in inverted flight. He then did left and right 90-degree inverted turns. As he completed a steep turn, he noticed that the oil pressure was at 0 psi. Before he could react, the engine seized and stopped. The pilot made a successful landing on a road but had to negotiate around a 45-degree left bend; as the airplane rounded the curve, a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction collided with the left wing. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the connecting rod near cylinder Nos. 5 and 6 had failed when the engine seized. Further examination found that the shuttle valve, which controlled oil flow while the airplane was in inverted flight, had a triangular shaped shard of metal wedged under the remaining steel ball.

A witness saw the airplane on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern and thought the airplane was operating at a very high angle-of-attack. He observed the airplane again a few minutes later, in the same location and operating in the same manner. A helicopter pilot reported that he saw a \u201cflash\u201d of an airplane wing, and then the accident airplane quickly departed controlled flight and descended to the ground. The airplane wreckage was located about 1 mile southeast of the airport. The examination of the engine and airframe did not reveal any additional abnormalities that would have precluded normal operation. A review of the student pilot\u2019s logbook revealed that he had a total of 14.7 flight hours, including 12.5 hours in the accident airplane. His logbook\u2019s last five entries were annotated as patterns and touch-and-go takeoffs; there was no record of any stall or spin avoidance training noted in his logbook.The airplane\u2019s stall warning switch, located in the wing, did not indicate any electrical continuity when activated; a small amount of corrosion was observed under the terminal ends of the wires and the wire contact area. The wiring and screws were reassembled and the test was repeated; when activated, electrical continuity was noticed on the meter. The student pilot (who was the airplane owner) had told family members that the stall warning switch was not working properly, so the flight instructor would disable it for each flight.  However, even with the stall switch disabled, the instructor should have noticed that the airplane was operating at low speed and high angle of attack yet he did not take corrective action. Based on the circumstances surrounding the accident, it is likely that the student pilot stalled the airplane while performing a high angle-of-attack turn to the downwind leg in the traffic pattern. The airplane\u2019s low altitude would not have provided the pilots with sufficient time or altitude to recover. Additionally, toxicological testing on the flight instructor detected an antihistamine that is commonly used as a sleep aid in the liver and blood at a potentially impairing level; the antihistamine has potential side effects including cognitive and psychomotor impairment. It is likely that the flight instructor\u2019s use of the sedating medication contributed to his failure to take remedial action when the student flew the airplane at such a high angle of attack at a low altitude.

Just as he was starting to turn final, he heard another pilot broadcast that he was departing Stuart Island to the east. The pilot then transmitted, \"Aircraft close in, landing to the west, Stuart\". He then prepared to execute a go-around. But, as he rounded the corner of the island and rolled out on final, the pilot saw an aircraft pull off of the runway to the grassy area to its south. He therefore decided to continue his approach to a full-stop landing. Upon touchdown on the 2,000 foot runway, the aircraft encountered a significant amount of standing water, and the pilot immediately retracted the flaps in order to get more weight on the wheels for braking. Because of the amount of standing water, the aircraft began to hydroplane, and as it neared the end of the runway, it still had not come to a stop. In an attempt to keep the aircraft from going off the far end of the runway, the pilot intentionally executed a sharp turn to the right. Just after the turn was initiated, the left main gear and the nose gear dug into the soft muddy surface, resulting in the aircraft tipping up on its left side and the left wing contacting the runway surface. During the investigation it was determined that a heavy rain shower had passed through the area about 15 minutes prior to the landing, and that there was still a significant portion of the runway surface that had standing water on it. During a post-accident interview, the pilot started that he did not realize that there was so much standing water on the runway until after he touched down and it started spraying up on the bottom of the wing and onto the windshield. He further stated that if he had realized that the potential for hydroplaning was so great, he would have slowed his approach speed to compensate for the overly-wet conditions.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's excessive airspeed on final for the current runway surface conditions, and the intentional obstruction avoidance maneuver he executed when it became clear the aircraft was about to go off the end of the runway. Factors include the pilot's improper decision to land on a surface that he had not first inspected from the air, clouds and rain in the area, and a wet, muddy landing surface."

The accident flight was operating on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan at a cruise altitude of 10,000 feet mean sea level (msl) prior to descent for the approach.  After descent to 6,000 feet msl, further descent to 4,000 feet msl at pilot's discretion was authorized by air traffic control (ATC).  The pilot requested to remain at 6,000 feet in order to stay \"out of the clouds here [until] the last minute [due to] possible icing.\"  Shortly afterward the pilot requested and was cleared by ATC to climb to 7,000 feet msl when the aircraft encountered \"light\" rime and mixed icing conditions.  The flight was subsequently cleared for the global positioning system (GPS) instrument approach to runway 33.  Radar track data indicated that the aircraft began a descent from 7,000 feet about 9 nautical miles (nm) southeast of the destination and intercepted the published approach course.  The radar track data plot depicted the airplane crossing the GPS runway 33 approach final approach fix (FAF), located 5 nm south-southeast of the runway threshold, at 6,000 feet msl.  The minimum altitude crossing the FAF was 3,000 feet msl, according to the published procedure.  Final radar contact was at 4,000 feet msl about 2 nm south-southeast of the airport.  The normal floor of radar coverage in the area was 4,000 feet msl.  The airplane subsequently impacted terrain about 1 nm north-northwest of the airport.
