The Piper Arrow was cleared to land on runway 12R, 54 seconds before the Piper Mirage was given a takeoff clearance on the intersecting runway.  During this time frame, the local controller and local assist controller were both viewing the D-Brite radar and looking out the tower cab's rear windows for a helicopter that had entered the class D airspace without authorization.  With both controllers attention diverted to the helicopter, they failed to effectively monitor the runway operation and did not ensure proper separation was maintained between the two airplanes operating on the intersecting runways.  Radar data indicated when the pilot of the Piper Arrow contacted the LC-1 controller and reported inbound for landing, the airplane was approximately 6 miles north-northeast of the airport and tracking a course of about 200 degrees.  The airplane remained on that course, and the pilot was cleared to land when the airplane was approximately 2 1/4 miles north-northwest of the airport.  About 20 seconds later the airplane began a left turn towards the airport.  The airplane\u2019s radar track indicated the pilot of the Piper Arrow flew a standard base leg to final approach, in accordance with the issued clearance.  When the LC-1 controller cleared the pilot of the Piper Mirage for takeoff, the Piper Arrow was about 1 1/2 miles northeast of the airport on final to runway 12R with the data tag on the D-Brite radar showing a ground speed of 110 knots.  Assuming that Piper Arrow\u2019s ground speed remained 110 knots or less during the remainder of the approach, the airplane was about 1 minute away from touchdown.  This meant that the pilot of the Piper Mirage had less than 1 minute to power up his aircraft, taxi on to runway 7, begin a departure roll, and travel about 725 feet in order to pass through the intersection of runway 12R before the Piper Arrow crossed the landing threshold for runway 12R.  While this is not impossible, the minimal time available for Piper Mirage to depart before the Piper Arrow arrived warranted close monitoring by the controllers to ensure that separation was maintained at the intersection.",

The carburetor was installed on the engine on June 3, 1996, and had accumulated 1,246 hours since installation at the time of the accident.  The accepted procedure after removing carburetor heat is to note that the engine rpm's increase either to the setting before the heat was applied, or to a greater rpm is carburetor ice was present.  The worn condition of the carburetor was known for the past 7 years, according to the pilot. ",

The operator's meteorology department had properly forecast the convective activity in the vicinity of the accident site and the flight crew indicated that they were aware of the forecast thunderstorm activity. About 19 minutes before the event, the flight received clearance to deviate around an area of scattered thunderstorms. The monitoring pilot then called the lead flight attendant (LFA) on the interphone and advised her to make sure all the flight attendants took their seats and remained seated until further notice as the flight deviated around some areas of weather and that it should not last much longer than 15 minutes. The pilots reported back on course and believed they were clear of any weather and were discussing allowing the flight attendants to resume their duties when they encountered a brief area of severe turbulence without warning. Both pilots indicated that they were clear of any clouds and were well clear of any echoes when the turbulence occurred. The LFA reported that although it had been \u201cbumpy\u201d most of the flight, when she received the call from the flight deck, it was smooth, and the seat belt sign was on. She walked to both galleys and told the flight attendants to be seated for the next 15 minutes. According to the LFA, about 12 to 13 minutes later, the turbulence encounter occurred.

When the accident airplane failed to arrive at the intended destination, the first pilot initiated an aerial search.  The airplane wreckage was discovered about a quarter-mile southeast of the departure lake.  The first pilot recalled having a conversation with the accident pilot concerning the use of the Cub Crafters main fuel valve installed in the accident airplane.  He said that the accident pilot commented that he was not flying the airplane normally assigned to him, which had the original Piper main fuel tank selector valve installed.  The accident pilot told the first pilot that he was unsure if the accident airplane's fuel selector valve should be operated in the BOTH position or the LEFT or RIGHT positions.  The FAA approved Cub Crafters STC requires the addition of a placard, placed just above the main fuel valve, which states: \"TAKE OFF AND LANDING ON BOTH ONLY.\"  The accident airplane had the placard installed.  During an on-scene inspection of the airplane wreckage, the fuel selector valve was found selected to the LEFT fuel tank setting, and the left fuel tank was empty.  A review of the State of Alaska, Department of Public Safety's \"aircraft manual,\" which outlines general operating policies and standards, disclosed that there were no provisions for differences training for the Cub Crafters fuel system.  ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's selection of the incorrect fuel tank, subsequent fuel starvation, and inadvertent stall during initial climb.  Factors associated with the accident were inadequate transition training, and insufficient training standards of the operator/management."

The accident flight departed and ATIS information was obtained when the flight was approximately 30 miles from the destination airport. The ATIS at that time indicated scattered clouds existed at 100 feet with 2 miles visibility. The flight continued and after passing the final approach fix during the ILS approach to runway 32, the tower controller advised the flight crew of an indefinite ceiling of 100 feet with 3/4 mile visibility, with the visibility being supplemented by the ground controller who is a National Weather Service train weather observer, from the previous weather observation taken at 0807. The audible alarm for the ASOS monitor was on at the time of the accident. The ASOS monitor was located due east from the center of the tower cab near the ground control position, while the local control position was located north-northwest from the center of the tower cab.  At 0826, a special METAR weather observation was taken indicating the visibility was 1/4 statute mile with fog, and a vertical visibility was 100 feet; the special observation was not provided to the flight crew.  At the time the special METAR was taken, the airplane was inside the final approach fix and at an altitude less than 459 feet above ground level. The pilot advised he was flying the airplane at Vref plus 4 knots, and both he and copilot reported the runway environment became visible when the flight was approximately 200 feet agl.  During the flare for landing, the flight entered heavy fog.  The pilot further reported that he could not determine the point of touchdown; however, while on the ground, the airplane passed the 1000 foot-remaining marker. Full braking and reverse was applied; however, the airplane traveled off the end of the runway onto wet grass and collided with a localizer antenna 557 feet past the departure end of the runway. The pilot further reported there was no preimpact failure or malfunction of the aircraft, aircraft systems, or engines. He also reported that the reason for the overrun was not due to the additional 4 knots, but was due to the fact that while flaring to land with the engines spool down, full flaps extended, and the indicated airspeed below Vmc, fog rolled over the runway severely limiting my view of it.

He stopped the turn and noted that the engine was at flight idle as indicated by the dual tachometer.  He verified the throttle was full open, and maneuvered the helicopter towards an open area.  He bled off main rotor rpm to clear obstacles that were ahead, and decelerated at 10 feet above ground level.  The helicopter touched down with little forward movement, coming to rest upright with the skids and tailboom separated.

Witnesses described hearing the airplane, but they could not see the airplane due to the inclement weather. The airplane impacted the ground in a left-wing-low and nose-down attitude, indicating that the airplane likely stalled.

The commercial pilot contacted the approach controller and stated that his attitude indicator was \"not helping\" and needed \"a little bit of help with trying to keep it straight.\"  The pilot was instructed by approach control to maintain an altitude of 3,000 feet msl.  The approach controller confirmed with the pilot that he could not fly headings, and instructed the pilot to turn right.  Seconds afterwards, the pilot was instructed to turn left and the controller would tell him when to stop the turn.  The pilot acknowledged.  There were no further communications between the pilot and air traffic control.  The airplane initially impacted in a near vertical attitude into a wooded area adjacent to a rural paved road, slid across the road, and impacted a residence.  Radar data showed that the airplane's magnetic heading was erratic throughout the 5-minute flight.  The gyro instruments found at the accident site were the co-pilot's direction gyro (vacuum), a turn and bank indicator (electric), and the pilot's attitude indicator (vacuum).  The gyros were disassembled, and visually examined.  The co-pilot's direction gyro examination revealed rotation signatures on the gyro and the gyro housing.  The turn and bank indicator revealed a \"faint\" rotational signature on the gyro.  The pilot's attitude indicator gyro had no rotational signatures, and exhibited blunt impressions corresponding to the gyro buckets on the inside of the gyro-housing wall.  A maintenance repair data plate (\"Functional Tested\") was found on the attitude indicator's instrument housing dated 12/2/02.  Due to the extent of the fire damage, no instrument readings could be obtained.  Seven days prior to the accident flight, a company pilot who flew the accident airplane reported that the pilot's attitude indicator (part number 102-0041-04, serial number 92B0346) \"rotated\" and the flight was aborted.  The next day, the attitude indicator was removed and bench checked, cleaned, and adjusted.  The attitude indicator was reinstalled and an operational check on the ground was performed.  Three days prior to the accident the pilot's attitude indicator was again removed for an overhaul.  According to company maintenance personnel, the attitude indicator was reinstalled the night prior to the morning of the accident, and an operational check on the ground was performed.

The pilot stated that he made the decision to prepare for an emergency landing and initiated a descent into a large wheat field that he deemed was best suited for an off-airport landing.  The pilot added that while approaching the wheat field, \"my motor started to flutter so I got down to the wheat field and that's when my tires got into the wheat and it flipped us over.\"  Examination of the airplane by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who responded to the accident site, revealed that the airplane left wing spar was bent, and the engine firewall was displaced.

During landing, the pilot lost airplane control and subsequently struck a parked ground vehicle. A pilot in another airplane that had been cleared to land reported that he saw two airplanes in front of his airplane: a light-colored high-wing airplane that was turning from the right base to the final leg of the traffic pattern, and a high-wing airplane, which was the accident airplane, directly in front of him on the right downwind leg. The pilot of the trailing airplane stated that the air traffic controller was providing instructions to the pilots of the other two airplanes simultaneously and that it appeared that the controller was concerned about the spacing between the two airplanes ahead of him and the fact that his airplane was a faster airplane than the other two airplanes.

The pilot reported that he tried to pull back on the yoke and use the manual trim to regain control, but the airplane did not respond.  The pilot said he lost complete pitch control when he attempted to flare during the landing.  The airplane abruptly nosed down and impacted the runway surface.  An examination of the wreckage revealed that the control yoke's movement was restricted.  Only partial up-elevator travel could be obtained.  One side of the autopilot's servo bridle cable for the elevator was found frayed and broken, and was detached from the servo capstan bridle cable locking pin.  The other servo bridle cable was found attached to the main elevator control cable and servo, but it was twisted and deformed.  Both servo capstan bridle cable guide pins were bent full forward.  One nylon guide pin guard was missing and was found in the fuselage belly.  The pitch servo (actuator) was removed from the airplane and examined at a repair station.  Upon investigation it was determined that the bridle cable had not been wrapped correctly and continued excessive unwrapping of the bridle cable from the capstan had caused it to fray and eventually break.  The servomotor initially would not start running until approximately 12 volts of direct current (DC) were applied to the motor.  The servo is designed for 28-volt DC operation.  After several on-and-off cycles of DC, the motor started running with approximately 5 to 6 volts DC applied.  However, even at the full 28 volts, the motor operated slowly.

He estimated that the airplane had about 30 to 32 gallons of fuel prior to departure from the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport (BJC), Denver, Colorado, about 1825 mst . During the flight, intermittent electrical issues were experienced including static in the headsets, flickering instrument panel lights and a fluctuating ammeter gauge. Attempts were made to alleviate the electrical issues to no avail. A touch and go landing was made at the Kit Carson Airport (ITR), Burlington, Colorado, and a decision was made to shorten the flight and return to the departure airport. The pilot reported that the fuel gauges indicated that the airplane had about 8 gallons remaining in each fuel tank about his time. After 20 minutes had elapsed from the departure from ITR, the fuel gauges showed empty. About 2035 mst, the engine stopped producing power and the pilot switched to the opposite fuel tank. The engine restarted and the flight continued for about 4 to 5 more minutes when the engine again stopped producing power. During the forced landing attempt the airplane struck wires and subsequently impacted the ground. The pilot and the flight instructor stated that the airplane's fuel load prior to departure should have been sufficient for a flight of about 3 hours. The total duration of the accident flight was about 2.25 hours. Examination of the airplane subsequent to the accident revealed no fuel remaining in either wing tank. There was no evidence of a fuel spill and no preimpact anomalies were found with respect to the airplane's fuel system. The pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented by ordering more fuel prior to departure or obtaining fuel at ITR. The airplane was equipped with electrically powered fuel level gauges and electrical fuel level sending units. Federal Aviation Administration regulations for visual flights during night conditions require carriage of sufficient fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and an additional 45 minutes. Based on the available information, it is likely that the airplane's fuel supply was exhausted resulting in a complete loss of engine power.

Shortly afterward, the controller advised the crew that aircraft capable of required navigation performance (RNP) approaches to runway 13C would be accepted to MDW. The flight crewmembers mistakenly loaded and briefed a different procedure, the area navigation (RNAV) global positioning system (GPS) approach, before entering the holding pattern. While in the holding pattern, the flight crew performed a landing distance assessment using the onboard performance computer (OPC). The calculation results showed sufficient runway length for the landing in accordance with the flight manual procedures. Data from the cockpit voice recorder and the OPC indicate that the crew performed the assessment correctly.After receiving air traffic control (ATC) clearance to leave the holding pattern and begin the approach to MDW, the flight crewmembers discussed confusion about the approach instruction, likely because they had loaded and briefed the wrong approach procedure. The flight crew then identified the proper approach procedure chart. The crew subsequently reprogrammed the flight management system for the correct approach and amended some of the procedure crossing altitudes in order to follow ATC instructions. These activities at this point in the approach resulted in extra workload for the flight crew.Later, as flight 1919 neared the runway, the flight crew set flaps to 15. The flight crew of a preceding Southwest Airlines 737 arrival reported \u201cfair\u201d braking action on runway 13C to ATC. The air traffic controller did not advise the flight 1919 crew of the braking action report transmitted by the previous arrival; however, the incident crew overheard the report and correctly recalculated the landing distance assessment, which again indicated sufficient runway length available. The incident crew also set the airplane autobrakes appropriately for the conditions.In addition to discussion regarding the approach procedure automation, the crew had additional operational distractions in the final minutes of the approach. These included a momentary flap overspeed as the first officer attempted to set flaps to 25, assessment of a rain shower passing over the airport, and incorrect settings for minimum altitude reminders. The delay in setting flaps to 25 as the first officer waited for airspeed to decay occurred about the same time that the crew normally should have been executing the Before Landing checklist, which includes the item \u201cspeedbrake\u2014armed.\u201d No mention of speedbrakes or the Before Landing checklist is heard on the cockpit voice recording, and data from the flight data recorder (FDR) indicate that the speedbrakes were not armed.The airplane touched down within 500 feet of the runway threshold. After touchdown, the captain perceived a lack of braking effectiveness and quickly applied full manual brakes. Speedbrakes did not deploy upon touchdown, nor were thrust reversers deployed. About 16 seconds after touchdown, thrust reversers were manually deployed, which also resulted in speedbrake deployment per system design, when the airplane had about 1,500 feet of runway remaining. As the airplane neared the end of the pavement, the captain attempted to turn onto the connecting taxiway but was unable. The airplane struck a taxiway light and rolled about 200 feet into the grass.FDR data and component examination revealed that all airplane systems operated as expected. The automatic speedbrakes were not armed and, therefore, would not deploy upon touchdown without crew action. Extending the speedbrakes after landing increases aerodynamic drag and reduces lift, which increases the load applied to the main gear tires and makes the wheel brakes more effective. A lack of speedbrake deployment results in severely degraded stopping ability. According to the flight operations manual, braking effectiveness is reduced by as much as 60 percent. The flight crew\u2019s delay in applying reverse thrust also contributed to the amount of runway used.Simulation studies concluded that the airplane would have stopped with about 900 feet of runway remaining if the speedbrakes had been deployed at touchdown (without reverse thrust) or with about 1,950 feet remaining if both speedbrakes and reverse thrust had been deployed at touchdown, per standard procedures. The calculated braking coefficient of the incident airplane was consistent with a \u201cfair\u201d braking action report, as given by the preceding Southwest Airlines 737 arrival. The braking coefficient is also in accordance with the OPC calculations.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight crew's delayed deployment of the speedbrakes and thrust reversers, resulting in insufficient runway remaining to bring the airplane to a stop.Contributing to the delay in deployment of these stopping devices was the flight crew's inadequate monitoring of the airplane's configuration after touchdown, likely as a result of being distracted by a perceived lack of wheel braking effectiveness.Contributing to the incident was the flight crew's omission of the Before Landing checklist, which includes an item to verify speedbrake arming before touchdown, as a result of workload and operational distractions during the approach phase of flight."

He secured the #2 engine & made an uneventful landing. Examination of the failed Williams-Rolls FJ44-1A engine revealed it had sustained an uncontained high pressure turbine (HPT) disk blade retention post failure. Examination of the HTP disk (PN 48629) showed that a blade retention post had fractured adjacent to the bottom of the blade slots & that 3 adjacent HPT blades had broken loose. Subsequently, the upper portion of the fuel-oil heat exchanger mount pad was fractured, which resulted in an oil leak. Metallurgical examination revealed the primary failure was the release of a blade retaining lobe just below a fret zone. Creep fatigue was found at the failed blade retaining holes. No evidence of gross overheating was noted. The failed disk was of an 'older' design. As a result of the incident, Williams-Rolls Alert Service Bulletins No. FJ44-A72-30 and -31 were issued to describe a procedure for eddy current inspection (ECI) of the high pressure turbine (HPT) disk blade retention posts to locate possible cracks and to describe a procedure for replacing the existing HPT disks with an advanced-design HPT disk.

He stated he intentionally flared the gyroplane \"too high\" at an altitude of 10 feet above the runway.  The CFI stated the student quickly corrected so he added a \"little more flare\" overlooking that the gyrocopter had already begun to settle.  He reported the gyrocopter then descended vertically making hard contact with the runway.  The left landing gear axle separated and the gyrocopter rolled onto its left side.   The CFI reported he will no longer teach the recovery of an improper flare at low altitude and will put greater emphasis on the understanding and recovery of being \"behind the power curve.\"  The gyrocopter sustained substantial damage to the rotor mast assembly.",
            "probable_cause": "The CFI's failure to maintain control of the gyrocopter which resulted in settling with power and the subsequent hard landing.  Factors associated with the accident were the CFI's decision to excessively flare the gyrocopter at a low altitude."

He also reported that after the engines to the airplane were started, the airplane stayed on the ramp and idled for 10 to 15 minutes. No one saw the pilot taxi to the runway, but he taxied to the north end of Runway 18 for a downwind takeoff to the south. Examination of the accident site found the wreckage oriented along a path consistent with an extended centerline of runway 18. The airplane was found along a fence line approximately 1/4 mile from the departure end of Runway 18.  The airplane's track was along a 183-degree bearing, and there was a large burn area prior to and around the debris zone along the wreckage path. Examination of the cockpit revealed a 9/16-inch hex-head bolt inserted in the control lock pinhole for the control column.
