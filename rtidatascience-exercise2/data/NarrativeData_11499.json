The airplane was equipped with four fuel tanks; left main and left auxiliary tanks and right main and right auxiliary tanks. Two fuel quantity gauges indicated fuel quantity in either the main tanks or the auxiliary tanks based upon the position selected on a separate switch on the pilot's sub-panel.   Approaching the airport the pilot completed the pre-landing checklist and confirmed the fuel selectors were on the main tanks.  He had not changed the fuel selector valve handle positions since before takeoff, 45 minutes earlier, and believed he had been feeding fuel from the main tanks the entire flight.  He turned on the fuel boost pumps to the \"low\" position and confirmed the fuel quantity gauge select switch was also set to indicate fuel quantity in the main tanks.  As the airplane entered the landing pattern on crosswind leg, 1/2 to 1 mile from the departure end of the runway, the left engine began to \"surge.\"  The fuel gauges read 1/3 tank and the pilot, believing fuel supply was not the problem, elected to feather the left propeller and secure the left engine.  Continuing the approach, the pilot extended the downwind leg and turned onto base leg about 1.5 miles from the landing runway threshold.  As the airplane was turning onto final approach he lowered the landing gear and, as the gear was extending, the right engine began to surge.  He then believed he did have a fuel starvation problem and attempted to unfeather and restart the left engine.  The airplane was settling rapidly and he realized he wouldn't be able to reach the runway or restart the engines.  He located a clearing beyond some houses and landed the airplane there.  The person who recovered the wreckage reported draining 23 gallons of fuel from each main tank , 1/2-gallon from the left auxiliary tank and 1 cup of fuel from the right auxiliary tank.  The fuel selector valve handles were in the main tank position and the fuel quantity gauge selector switch was in the main tank position.  It is possible on this model airplane to select the fuel quantity gauges to indicate fuel quantity in the main tanks while the engines are, in fact, receiving fuel from the auxiliary tanks.  Both engines were subsequently installed on a test stand and operated satisfactorily.  No mechanical defects were noted on the airframe or engines.",

The flight instructor and student pilot were fatally injured. The airplane was registered to WBR Interests LLC and operated by United Flight Systems, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, without a flight plan. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local area training flight that had departed DWH at 1900.According to preliminary air traffic control (ATC) data, the purpose of the instructional flight was to remain in the local traffic pattern to practice nighttime takeoffs and landings. At 1900:24, the tower controller cleared the accident flight for takeoff and to remain in a left traffic pattern for touch-and-go landings on runway 17R (7,009 feet by 100 feet, asphalt). The accident airplane was first observed on radar about 150 feet above ground level (agl) while on the upwind leg. The airplane continued to make left traffic for runway 17R before being cleared for the first touch-and-go landing at 1904:40. At 1906:48, the airplane descended below available radar coverage while on a 1/4 mile final for runway 17R. The airplane reemerged on radar at 1908:15, about 1/4 mile south of the runway departure threshold at about 250 feet agl. The airplane continued to make left traffic for runway 17R before being cleared for the second touch-and-go landing at 1911:10. At 1913:48, the last radar return was recorded for the accident flight about 1/3 mile north of the runway approach threshold at about 150 feet agl. At 1914:42, the flight instructor told the tower controller that they were having \"engine problems\" and requested to make a 180-degree turn back to the airport for a landing. (The airplane had completed the touch-and-go landing and was on initial climb when the flight instructor reported the loss of engine power.)A witness reported hearing the accident airplane while it was on a left downwind leg for runway 17R and remarked that the sound of the engine was abnormal. The same witness reported that the engine continued to run rough while the airplane was on initial climb following a touch-and-go landing. Several witnesses to the accident reported seeing the accident airplane in a steep left turn before it entered a near vertical descent into terrain. Two of these witnesses reported seeing the wingtip navigation and strobe lights in a near vertical line (indicating a near 90-degree bank angle) before the airplane banked past 90-degrees and descended nose-low into the terrain.At 1853, the DWH automated surface observing system reported: calm wind, visibility 10 miles, sky clear, temperature 23 degrees Celsius, dew point 21 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 29.89 inches-of-mercury. The United States Naval Observatory reported that the sunset and end of civil twilight at DWH was at 1725 and 1751, respectively. The moonrise was at 1742 for the full-phase moon.",

The first two takeoffs and landings occurred normally; however, after the third takeoff, just after the airplane had lifted off the runway, the pilot's seat slipped all the way to the rear stops.  The pilot then pulled the throttle back to prevent a further climb, and the airplane landed hard on the runway.  A subsequent examination of the seat rails, seat rail pinholes, seat adjustment pin and coil spring by a manufacturer's representative and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed no anomalies.

They established visual contact with two airplanes that had announced their positions in the traffic pattern; one on the downwind leg and one on short final. The airplanes were also identified by the traffic avoidance system onboard the helicopter. The pilot followed behind and north of the second airplane and continued to the west side of the airport to complete a landing at the helipad. During the descent, about 500 feet above ground level (agl), the pilot \"saw about 2 feet of white wing right outside.\" He \"pulled power\" and then felt contact with an airplane. The airplane's right wing separated before it departed controlled flight and descended to the ground, fatally injuring both occupants. The helicopter subsequently landed with minor damage and no injuries to the 3 occupants. Interpolation of radar data revealed that the accident airplane departed from the same airport about 21 minutes prior to the accident and completed a right downwind departure, contrary to the established left traffic pattern. The airplane\u2019s transponder appeared to be off for about 3 minutes after takeoff before transmitting the visual flight rules transponder code (1200) for the remainder of the observed flight; the transponder appeared to be on and functioning at the time of the collision. The airplane proceeded north of the airport before reversing course and returning to approach the airport from the northeast. The last target was observed about 1.2 nautical miles north of the airport on a track leading toward the west side of the landing runway at an altitude of 500 feet agl. About 25 seconds later, the helicopter passed northeast of the airport on a modified left base, about 500 feet above traffic pattern altitude (1,500 feet agl), crossed the final approach course, and turned parallel to and on the west side of the runway. Although only the helicopter was observed by radar at the time of the collision, extrapolation of the accident airplane\u2019s previously observed targets and flight path placed the airplane at the accident site about the same time the helicopter was observed there. An analysis of the relative positions of the airplane and helicopter based on radar data indicated that the airplane remained below the helicopter pilot's field of view as the helicopter overtook the airplane from behind and descended upon it from above. Although the data indicated that the airplane would likely have been visible to the pilot of the helicopter, it is important to note that the onboard traffic avoidance system (TAS) did not provide the pilot with any alert of its presence because the system operated on line-of-sight principles. If an intruder aircraft\u2019s antenna was shielded from the TAS antenna, the ability of the TAS to track the target would be affected. If a TAS equipped aircraft was located directly above an intruder, the airframe of one or both of the aircraft could cause the TAS\u2019s interrogations to be shielded, depending on antenna location (either bottom or top-mounted). All other airplanes in the traffic pattern were acquired visually by the pilot and crew as their positions were confirmed by the helicopter's onboard traffic avoidance system and the position reports provided by the pilots of each airplane. Because of the high-wing structure of the airplane, and its relative position and altitude, the helicopter's image was either blocked from the airplane pilot's view by the left wing, or was above and behind the airplane in the seconds before collision. Further, no radio position reports from the accident airplane were confirmed. The helicopter pilot\u2019s unalerted detection of the airplane against a complex background of ground objects would have been difficult because of both the lack of apparent contrast between the airplane and the ground, its size in the windscreen, its relative lack of movement within the pilot\u2019s field of view, and the position and angle of the sun. In addition, the helicopter pilot\u2019s familiarity with the customary routes used by fixed-wing pilots to fly into and out of the airport also made detection of the airplane less likely, because the airplane was not in a location that normally contained conflicting traffic. Finally, before the helicopter turned and overtook the airplane, the helicopter pilot\u2019s visual attention would have likely been directed toward the landing area, which would also have limited opportunities for detection of the airplane. The airplane's departure and arrival were contrary to published Federal Aviation Administration guidance, the airplane owner's guidance, and the airplane pilot's guidance to his own students with regard to pattern entry at the destination airport.",
            "probable_cause": "The inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept, which made it difficult for the helicopter pilot to see the airplane before the collision. Contributing to the accident was the airplane pilot\u2019s non-standard entry to the airport traffic pattern, which, contrary to published Federal Aviation Administration guidance, was conducted 500 feet below the airport's published traffic pattern altitude and in a direction that conflicted with the established flow of traffic.

The private pilot was fatally injured. The aircraft was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed during the landing approach and the flight was operated on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight originated from the Florence Regional Airport (FLO), near Florence, South Carolina about 0609.Preliminary radar flight track data indicated that the airplane departed FLO about 0609 and proceeded on a west-southwest track before turning to a westerly track, and ultimately a west-northwest track toward ELD. The airplane came to rest in a densely wooded area about 2,200 feet from the approach end of runway 31 at ELD. The trees were estimated to be about 100 feet in height. The accident site was on airport property, but outside of the airport boundary fence. The airplane had impacted in a near vertical attitude as evidenced by the lack of damage to the tall trees. The airplane came to rest in an inverted position and the engine was beneath portions of the fuselage. An outboard section of the left wing was separated and located about 50 feet from the main wreckage. The inboard section of the left wing was located with the main wreckage and still had the flap and aileron attached to it. The right wing was predominately intact and the flap and aileron remained attached. The nose landing gear and the left main landing gear were noted in the extended position. The right main landing gear was in the wheel well. The flaps appeared to be retracted. The tail surfaces were still attached to the aft fuselage and the elevator and rudder remained attached. The fuselage cabin section was almost completely consumed by fire. The airplane was removed from the accident scene for further examination. The engine cowling was removed and an attempt to rotate the engine was unsuccessful. Following removal of the fuel pump, magnetos, vacuum pump and starter drive adapter from the rear accessory case, the engine was able to rotate freely. The upper spark plugs were removed and exhibited a normal but worn appearance. The engine was rotated and valve movement was verified on all cylinders. Suction and compression were verified on all cylinders except for the no. 2 cylinder. The rocker arms for the no. 2 cylinder were removed and the valves \"staked\". The engine was again rotated and compression was verified on the no. 2 cylinder. The fuel hoses from the airframe to the mechanical fuel pump, and to the fuel servo were damaged by the post-impact fire. The fuel distribution manifold on top of the engine was intact. The cover was removed and no fuel was observed within the assembly.The airplane had a two bladed constant speed propeller. The blades were predominately straight with no apparent evidence of rotation at impact. The spinner nose cone was crushed and also had no apparent evidence of twisting.The airplane's control system was examined. Control continuity was verified from all primary control surfaces (rudder, elevator, right aileron, left aileron) to the cockpit area where cuts in the cables to facilitate wreckage removal had been made. The aileron sprocket from the control yoke was found along with the associated chain/cable assembly. The chain was intact. The cables were intact from the chain to the cuts that had been made for wreckage removal and each cable remained attached to the chain.The separated portion of the airplane's left wing exhibited a semicircular indentation consistent with a tree strike. The angle represented by the indentation was consistent with an inverted left wing low impact angle. No apparent pre-impact structural defects were identified.The airplane's instrument panel was destroyed by the post-impact fire.",

After descending from traffic pattern altitude, the airplane landed and took off again. The airplane was then observed flying in a level attitude, over the runway at approximately 30 feet above ground level, and witnesses heard the engine pop, sputter, and then hesitate. The pilot reported to air traffic control that he was experiencing problems, and during the pilot's transmission, a sound similar to the engine losing power was audible.

            "narrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHTOn October 29, 2014, at 1711 Pacific daylight time, a Hawker Hunter MK.58, single-seat turbojet fighter airplane, registration N332AX, operated by ATAC (Airborne Tactical Advantage Company) under contract to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), crashed while on approach to Naval Air Station, Point Mugu (NTD), Oxnard, California (NTD). The sole occupant pilot aboard was fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and post-crash fire. The flight was conducted under the provisions of a contract between ATAC and the United States Navy to provide ATAC operated aircraft to support adversary and electronic warfare training with Carrier Strike Group 15 (CSG15). The airplane was operating as a non-military public aircraft under the provisions of Title 49 of the United States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 40102 and 40125.The accident airplane departed NTD at 1500 as the wingman in a flight of two Hawker Hunters, intending to participate in an adversarial support air defense training exercise off shore in warning area W291. The flight's radio call sign was \"ATAC 11\"; the accident aircraft was \"ATAC 12.\"The accident occurred during the arrival phase of the flight using the overhead break arrival to land on runway 21. The normal procedure for a flight of two Hawker Hunters to perform an overhead break arrival to runway 21 is for the flight leader to approach the runway break point and to make a left descending 270-degree turn until established on the downwind leg for runway 21. The second Hawker Hunter is to wait a pre-briefed period of time (2-4 seconds) before making the left turn entry. At the initiation of the base leg the pilot is to make a continuous descending 180-degree turn and roll out on final to land on runway 21. The flight was briefed for the arrival to maintain 180-170 knots in the turn, no slower than 160 knots on final with half flaps, or no slower than 150 knots on final with full flaps.Witnesses reported watching both airplanes make the approach and noted that ATAC 12's approach seamed lower and slower than the lead aircraft. ATAC 12 was observed in a left wing low bank followed by the wings rocking from side to side, and then a quick roll to the right when the airplane nosed down and impacted the ground.A video recording of the accident sequence was recovered from a fixed location near the accident site. The recording is consistent with witness statements, and is being analyzed for further detail.The aircraft was equipped with a single Garmin G3X panel-mount glass display, which has primary flight display (PFD) with attitude/directional guidance with electronic engine monitoring and moving map multifunction (MFD) capabilities. The installed configuration recorded 57 parameters at 1-second intervals (1Hz). The data card for the Garmin G3X was recovered at the accident site. The data was recovered and reviewed by the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC), and it included the entire flight, as well as the previous flights made by the accident pilot.A review of the data recorded for the last 30 seconds of the flight indicated the airspeeds started at 153 knots and decreased to 122.1 knots just before impacting the ground.PERSONNEL INFORMATIONThe operator reported that the 45-year-old pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane multiengine land, and commercial privileges for airplane single-engine land, and instrument airplane. The pilot held a first-class medical certificate issued on May 21, 2014. It had the limitations that the pilot must wear corrective lenses.The operator reported that the pilot had a total flight time of 3,727.1 hours, and an estimated 15.1 hours in the accident make and model. The pilot had recently retired from the United States Air Force after serving 21 years with a majority of his flight time in F-16's. The pilot was hired by ATAC on September 22, 2014, and started his initial training on September 23, 2014, and had completed training on October 7, 2014. The pilot then reported to ATAC at Point Mugu, Naval Air Station (NAS), Oxnard, to begin his operational training.The accident flight was the pilot's fifth flight with ATAC since reporting from his initial training. The pilot flew one mission on October 28, 2014, totaling 1.8 hours. Records show this was his only completed overhead break arrival. On October 26, 2014, the pilot flew two missions, totaling 3.7 hours, which included one overhead break arrival. On October 23, 2014, the pilot flew one mission totaling 1.8 hours. WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATIONThe accident site was located in a planted strawberry field located just east of Highway 1 and north of the final approach path to runway 21.Investigators examined the wreckage at the accident scene. The first identified point of contact (FIPC) was a ground scar with components of the right wing located in the ground scar. The debris path was along a magnetic heading of 290-degrees and was about 325 feet in length. The FIPC was 0.7 NM from the approach end of runway 21, on a magnetic heading of 035 degrees.The engine remained in the fuselage and was visually examined. The engine exhibited signatures consistent with the engine operating at a high power setting at the time of impact. The airframe flight control components were examined on scene with no abnormalities noted.The ejection seat system was examined on scene, and recovered for detailed examination. The results of the ejection seat system indicated that the ejection seat had activated as a result of the ground impact, and not due to pilot intervention.",

The airplane impacted the runway 6,300 feet from the start of the takeoff roll and burned.  The pilot was hired to ferry the airplane on an FAA issued Special Flight Permit from Japan to Illinois.  The pilot held a FAA airframe and power plant technician certificate with inspection authority, and was to supply and install the fuel tank system necessary for the long-range trans-Pacific flight.  While en route to Honolulu, he diverted to Johnston Atoll, due to a fuel flow problem from the ferry tanks to the aircraft fuel system.  The pilot discussed the problem with the aircraft owner, and the routing of the ferry fuel tank hoses and potential interference by airplane structure and landing gear was discussed as a possible problem area. After an 18-day delay, and prior to departure, the airplane was fueled with 50 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel sent to Johnston Atoll by barge, and 50 gallons of automotive fuel provided by the military.  The airplane was then flown to Honolulu, where the pilot locally purchased and installed an additional 45-gallon fuel tank, then on to Hilo.  The departure at Hilo was for the estimated 2,023-mile leg to Oakland, California.  The airplane was operating in an over-gross weight condition, which was within the authorized ferry flight weight limitation; however, the CG was in excess of 2 inches aft of the aft limit.  The CG variance was not authorized in the ferry permit.  The left engine was removed and successfully run meeting all Continental test parameters.  Disassembly of the left propeller disclosed marks consistent with operation at, or very near, low pitch stop at the time of impact, indicating something less than full power.  Automotive type rubber hoses were found routed and draped from ferry fuel tanks to the main gear wheel wells and through the airplane center section.  An auxiliary tank hose was found draped through the left landing gear retract brace.  The hose had evidence of being compressed by interference with the airplane structure and the gear retract braces.  No vapor return line to the left tank was found. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper fuel system modifications resulting in inadequate fuel flow to the left engine during a critical phase of flight.  Factors in the accident were the operation at an over gross weight condition with a CG more than 2 inches aft of the rear limit. "

The pilot noted various obstacles at the approach end of the landing zone; two trees about 50 feet apart from each other, which he intended to fly between, a 6-foot-high mound, followed by a 2-foot hole, and another 2-foot mound, and then a flat area with no additional obstacles.  On the approach, the wind shifted from a headwind to a tail wind.  The pilot reported that the airspeed dropped below ETL (effective translational lift) and resulted in a loss of lift.  He pushed the cyclic forward to gain forward airspeed and applied cyclic and power to avoid contacting the terrain below the top of the plateau.  This maneuver assisted in gaining altitude, placing the helicopter above the plateau, but not above the 6-foot mound.  He flared the helicopter, and as it passed over the mound, the tail rotor guard struck the top of the mound, which placed the helicopter in a nose down attitude.  One of the landing gear skids collided with the 2-foot mound, which broke off the tailboom.

The pilot was seriously injured and his three passengers were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.The takeoff at 68FD was performed by the pilot on runway 27 which was a turf covered runway and at the time of the accident had only 2,600 feet of its 5,280 foot runway available for use. Obstacles in the form of 70 foot tall trees existed at the departure end of the runway and were part of a heavily forested area which extended to the west of 68FD. According to witnesses the takeoff was uneventful, and when the airplane reached the trees at the end of the runway, it cleared them. Moments later the witnesses observed however that the airplane had begun to sink into the top of the trees and then roll to the right. It then disappeared from sight and the sound of impact was heard. Black smoke was then observed to rise up from behind the trees. Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that the airplane first made contact with a group of 70 foot high trees with the outboard portion of the right wing, then yawed and rolled to the right. It then struck several other trees on a magnetic heading of 305 degrees, separating the left outboard portion of the horizontal stabilator. The airplane then struck terrain 80 feet later in a right wing down, nose low attitude, then rotated to the right around its vertical axis and came to rest on a 119 degree magnetic heading. It was then partially consumed by a postcrash fire. Further examination also revealed the presence of propeller strikes on broken off tree branches and tree trunks that littered the ground, along with areas of burned underbrush and fire damaged trees along the flight path. No evidence of any preimpact failures of the airplane structure was discovered and all major portions of the airplane's structure were present at the accident site. Examination of the flight control system revealed no evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction of the system and control continuity was established from the control wheel to the ailerons and stabilator, and from the rudder pedals to the rudder. The wing flaps were in the up position.Examination of the propeller and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions. The propeller remained attached to the propeller flange. One propeller blade exhibited twisting, S-bending, and chord wise scratching and the other propeller blade displayed forward bending, and chordwise scratching. Oil was present in the rocker boxes and oil sump, and the coarse and fine oil screens were absent of debris. Crankshaft and valve train continuity was confirmed and examination of the interior of the cylinders with a lighted borescope did not reveal evidence of any preimpact damage to the piston domes, cylinder walls, or valves. The spark plugs were normal in appearance. The magnetos were fire damaged and could not be tested.The pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land.

Within a few seconds after landing on the water, the helicopter rolled inverted, the pilot and passengers exited, inflated their personal life vests, and waited for rescue.  The pilot and one of the passengers drowned prior to rescue personnel arriving about 2 hours after the accident.  Surviving passenger statements indicated that they were not aware of an emergency lift raft on-board the helicopter, and that the skid-mounted emergency float system was not inflated prior to landing.  Rescue personnel reported high wind and rough seas in the area of the accident.  Examination of the wreckage revealed that the float \"ARM\" switch was found in the disarmed position and its cover closed.   The skid-mounted emergency floats were found inside their protective bags.  The float system tested functional, and no anomalies were found during airframe component examinations.  Download data from the ECU showed  that engine performance prior to the loss of power was normal and the engine was operating in a steady state condition prior to the initial deterioration of NG.  Detailed inspection of the engine revealed progressive turbine wheel damage throughout the power turbine.  The damage varied from approximately 95% of the airfoil material missing on the 1st stage wheel to approximately 10% of the material missing on the 4th stage wheel.  The damage observed in the gas producer turbine section was consistent with the separation of one or more of the first stage wheel airfoils.

Fracture surfaces of the 1st stage wheel airfoils did not reveal the presence of fatigue.  Detailed metallurgical examination revealed the presence of sulfides on the 1st and 2nd stage turbine wheel surfaces.  According to the manufacturer, the presence of sulfides is evidence that sulfidation has occurred.  Damage on the concave surface adjacent to the fractures near the leading edges of the airfoils was found consistent with type 1 hot corrosion (sulfidation) damage.  Examination of radial cracks at the trailing edges of the airfoils revealed heavy oxidation consistent with thermal fatigue.

The commercial pilot, the sole occupant, received fatal injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by the Arkansas Forestry Commission as a public-use aircraft. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area near the accident site at the time of the accident. The pilot filed a company visual flight rules flight plan. The airplane departed from the Malvern Municipal Airport (M78), Malvern, Arkansas, at 1240, on a local fire detection flight.The pilot originally scheduled for the flight needed to cancel due to sickness. The accident pilot was contacted on the morning of the accident and was asked if he wanted to take the flight. He agreed to take the flight, and he arrived at the airport at 1200 to check weather and preflight the airplane. There is no aviation weather reporting station located at M78. The closest weather reporting station is located in Hot Springs, Arkansas, located 19 nautical miles (nm) to the northwest of M78. At 1153, the Hot Springs surface weather observation was reporting a ceiling of 1,500 feet above ground level (agl). At 1153, the Mount Ida surface weather observation was reporting a ceiling of 1,100 feet agl. The 1155 surface weather observation at Mena, Arkansas, was reporting a ceiling of 500 feet agl.  The pilot departed M78 at 1240 to conduct a fire detection flight of Fire District 2 (D-2) using a predetermined flight route. The pilot reported his flight progress to the dispatch center which provided flight following. The pilot reported entering the eastern boundary of the forest district at 1253. At 1258, he reported checkpoint 2, which is located at Mt. Ida, Arkansas. The pilot turned north toward checkpoint 1, located 32 nm to the north at Danville, Arkansas. At 1303, the pilot reported to the dispatch center that he was 20 nm from checkpoint one and he was turning back due to low ceilings. At 1311, the pilot reported that he was 3 nm west of Oden, Arkansas, which is about 16 nm southwest of his last reported position on a magnetic bearing of 244 degrees. There were no further radio transmissions from the pilot. The accident site was located about 13 nm from the last reported position near Oden, Arkansas, on a magnetic bearing of 171 degrees.  The airplane impacted trees on a ridgeline, which had an elevation of 1,473 feet. The outboard section of the left wing was found on top of the ridge line. The main wreckage was located 0.3 mile south of the ridgeline at an elevation of 686 feet on a 175 degree magnetic bearing. There were no witnesses to the accident. When the pilot did not check in with the dispatch center after 30 minutes from his last communication, the dispatch center attempted to contact the pilot. At 1431, the Federal Aviation Administration's Flight Service Station was contacted about the overdue airplane and the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center was notified. Ground and aerial searches were made for the missing airplane, but weather conditions over the next 11 days hampered the search effort. The airplane wreckage was located on February 11, 2014. The 1153 surface weather observation at the Hot Springs Memorial Field Airport (HOT), Hot Springs, Arkansas, located 35 nm miles on a 082 degrees magnetic bearing from the accident site, was wind 150 degrees at 4 knots; 10 miles visibility; overcast 1,500 feet; temperature 10 degrees Celsius (C); dew point 5 degrees C; altimeter 29.97 inches of mercury.

The fixed base operator's (FBO) receptionist heard a voice on the Unicom frequency say, \"We're crashing, we're going in,\" or words to that effect. Witnesses saw the airplane descend vertically and impact an open field in a residential area. They said the engine was developing full power. During wreckage examination, a brass nut was found in the crushed skin of the empennage. The nut was identified as coming from an air hose assembly. Many of the airplane's systems were pneumatically operated (i.e., engine start, flaps/landing gear extension/retraction). On one end of the assembly was a brass adapter that consisted of a nut and fitting.  According to a partner of Squadron 52 LLC, the adapter portion of the assembly was always connected to, and was an integral part of, the hose assembly.  Although not normally carried in the airplane, an air hose assembly was usually carried on cross-country trips in the event the air tank developed a leak and there was insufficient pressure to start the engine.

A witness reported observing the airplane in level flight about 1,000 feet above ground level before it entered a steeply banked turn. The airplane was halfway through the turn when the right wing folded up over the fuselage. The wing departed the airframe, and the airplane rapidly descended to the ground. The right wing was located about 1,090 feet from the main wreckage. The owner/pilot was not the builder of the airplane, and he had no record of aerobatic flight experience. The pilot-rated passenger's logbook indicated that he had made a single 0.5-hour flight in another RV-6 that included performance of rolls and wing-overs. The operating limitations document for the airplane noted that aerobatic flight was prohibited unless such flights were satisfactorily accomplished and recorded in the aircraft logbook during its flight test period. No entries were found in the logbook that would satisfy this requirement. Postaccident examination of the separated right wing determined that the upper and lower spar-caps had failed in buckle and overload. Although the airplane was registered with the Federal Aviation Administration by the builder as an RV-6-CH model, the design of its spar caps was found to be substantially different from the kit manufacturer's design for the RV-6 model airplane, a model which can be approved for aerobatic maneuvers. Rather the design was similar to the wing cap spar design for the older RV-3 model airplane, a design which was found to be susceptible to failure in buckle when exposed to aerobatic flight. Following a number of inflight wing failures in RV-3 airplanes during aerobatic flight, the kit manufacturer recommended that no aerobatic maneuvers be performed in RV-3 model airplanes until wing spar modifications that increase the spar's stiffness and resistance to buckling have been accomplished. Because the purpose of the flight was performance of an aerobatic maneuver (rolls) and because the airplane's wing spar cap design was not suitable for aerobatic flight, it is likely that at some point during the flight, an aerobatic maneuver was performed that weakened the wing, and the final steep turn was then sufficient to overload the wing.Toxicology results showed that the owner/pilot had therapeutic levels of diphenhydramine, a sedating antihistamine, in his system; however, it could not be determined if he was flying at the time of the accident or if this impairment contributed to the accident.",

The pilot then performed a forced landing to trees.  Examination of the Lycoming IO-540 series engine revealed that the zinc-plated crankshaft gear attachment bolt was fractured, and that the crankshaft no longer drove the gear.  Fracture surface analysis revealed intergranular separation due to hydrogen-assisted cracking.  Engines had previously been built with cadmium-plated bolts, but zinc-plated bolts were being used because they were readily available, and had a \"positive impact\" on production.  Lycoming received 8,500 zinc-plated bolts between November 1996 and July 1998.  Lycoming manufactured or re-built/overhauled 1,088 engines with zinc-plated bolts, and shipped 2,667 zinc-plated bolts as spares.  Two zinc-plated gear bolt failures were documented in helicopter engines in 1998, due to hydrogen embrittlement.  One bolt failed at 30 hours of operation, and the other at 19 hours.  Lycoming and FAA personnel believed the failures occurred due to the higher loads generated by helicopters.  Based upon the two failures, Lycoming removed the bolts from its stock as a \"precautionary measure\" in July 1998.  Bolt recalls were issued by the helicopter manufacturer and Lycoming in July 1998.  The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive (AD) in February 1999 to replace the crankshaft bolts in affected helicopter engines worldwide.  In July 1999, a Piper PA-32R-301 bolt failed due to hydrogen embrittlement at 327 hours.  Between March 2000 and January 2001, two bolts failed on Royal Jordanian Falcon trainer airplanes, at 292 and 179 hours.  As a \"precautionary measure,\" Lycoming replaced the crankshaft gear bolts in the five-airplane Jordanian Falcon fleet about February 2001.  Lycoming and FAA personnel believed the failures did not extend beyond helicopter and aerobatic applications, although the PA-32R-301 failure occurred in 1999.  In June 2002, another bolt failed on a Piper PA-32R-301, at 448 hours.  The engine was examined by Lycoming and FAA personnel, and a Lycoming laboratory report stated the failure was due to hydrogen embrittlement.  In September 2002, this accident occurred, and as a result of the investigation, about 2 weeks after the accident, Lycoming issued a Service Bulletin (SB) to replace bolts on certain 540-series engines.  In October 2002, the FAA issued an Emergency AD to also replace the bolts.  The common cause for hydrogen embrittlement is a missed or under baked condition.",
            "probable_cause": "the improper manufacturing of the crankshaft gear bolt, which resulted in the failure of the bolt due to hydrogen embrittlement, and the subsequent loss of engine power.  Also causal was the engine manufacturer's failure to remove the affected bolts from fixed wing engines during the 4-year period that transpired between the initial failures and removal of the bolts from stock for installation, until the accident flight.  A factor in the accident was inadequate oversight (lack of action) by the FAA during the 4-year period in which the bolts remained in serviceable engines."

The private pilot/owner was seriously injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. According to the chief pilot of Velocity Aircraft, the airplane was recently purchased by the pilot. The sale was brokered by the previous owner, and the airplane was flown to the Velocity facility for a conditional inspection, the installation of new door latches, and delivery to the new owner. The pilot was provided with 3.6 hours of familiarization training in a Velocity company airplane over the two days prior to the accident. The accident flight was witnessed by the chief pilot and others, and their descriptions of the event were consistent throughout. The airplane departed runway 28 after a ground roll of approximately 1,000 feet and passing the intersection of runway 05/23. Immediately after rotation, the witnesses watched the right cabin door open. The airplane maintained runway heading briefly, then began a \"slow, lingering\" left turn back towards runway 05. One witness described the engine sound as increasing and decreasing between idle and full power. The airplane would alternately roll left, then wings level, and roll left again before it ultimately descended to ground contact south of runway 05. The airplane impacted trees near the airport perimeter, where the right wing separated and the fuselage was substantially damaged. Immediately after the accident, a responding police officer asked the pilot what happened. The pilot reported that he was taking off, and when the airplane reached about 50 feet, at approximately 80-90 knots, \"the door blew open.\" In a subsequent interview with a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation safety inspector, the pilot said the airplane \"pitched up violently\" on takeoff, and wouldn't respond to nose-down pitch trim.Examination of the airplane by the FAA inspector revealed that control continuity could be established from the flight control surfaces on the left wing to the cockpit area and from the flight control surfaces in the right wing to the break. The control stick was broken off in the cockpit.The latch mechanism on the right cabin door was found intact and fully functional. The pitch trim was found in a nearly full nose-up setting. Electrical power was applied, and when activated the pitch trim motor ran through its full range at its \"normal\" rate. The pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane. Examination of his logbook revealed 935 total hours of flight experience, of which 9 hours were in the accident airplane make and model. His most recent FAA third class medical certificate was issued on January 31, 2015.The airplane was manufactured in 2007 and was equipped with a Superior IO-360 series, 180 hp, reciprocating engine.

When he was about one-half mile from the airport, he inadvertently allowed the airspeed to drop below stall speed (Vs), and the airplane stalled and mushed into the terrain. A postaccident inspection of the latch found it to be fully functional, with no evidence that it would not latch the canopy if the canopy was firmly closed.  The latching mechanism is of a spring-loaded self-activating design that automatically slides over the top of a tang attached to the canopy when the canopy is firmly closed by the pilot. The mechanism then remains in the latched position until the pilot moves the release ring into a position that causes the latch to release.  The latching mechanism is located about a foot above, and six inches behind, the right shoulder of a pilot sitting in the left seat. In this position the latch is not easily checked visually, thus dictating that the pilot close the canopy firmly, and then push up on the canopy firmly in order to ensure that the latching mechanism has become fully engaged.  Discussions with the manufacturer disclosed that since the time that this airplane was manufactured, but prior to this accident, the manufacturer redesigned the airplane canopy latching system. The new design incorporates two latching mechanisms that are located just forward of the pilot on the left and right side fuselage surfaces upon which the canopy rests when closed. The mechanisms are not self-locking, and are instead positive-action latches that must be engaged by the pilot.",

The flight instructor, who was seated in the left seat in the Cessna 172RG, and the pilot-rated student reported that they departed the airport and then proceeded to a practice area northwest of the airport heading in a westerly direction at 3,500 ft mean sea level (msl). After reaching the practice area, the flight instructor made two position reports on the local practice area frequency; he received no radio acknowledgement of his position reports and heard no radio transmissions from any other aircraft in the area. The pilot receiving instruction then began to conduct clearing turns. The pilot made a right turn to a northerly heading and then turned the airplane back to the left and leveled off on the original westerly heading at 3,400 ft msl. The flight instructor reported that he was looking to the front and left, which was his normal traffic scan practice. When the airplane leveled off, he heard a \u201cloud bang\u201d and felt something hit the left side of the airplane. The flight instructor looked outside at the left wing and noted that it was damaged from the wing root outboard, the pitot tube was missing, and the left side windscreen was broken with metal\u00a0protruding into the airplane. The flight instructor took control of the airplane and determined that it could not maintain altitude, so he made a forced landing onto a nearby golf course.The Cessna 172M was operating as a personal flight. A review of radar data showed the Cessna 172M approaching the practice area on an easterly heading and climbing from 3,200 feet msl. When it reached 3,400 feet msl, it collided with the Cessna 172RG. The Cessna 172M subsequently made a sharp left turn and descended rapidly into terrain. A postcrash fire consumed the wreckage. Postaccident examination of both airplanes\u2019 airframes and engines revealed no mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Postaccident examination of the Cessna 172RG identified scratch marks and paint transfer marks on the left wing. Four pieces from the Cessna 172M\u2019s right horizontal stabilizer and elevator were found at the golf course; scratch marks were noted along the upper outboard portion of the largest horizontal stabilizer piece. Based on the paint transfer and scratch marks on both airplanes and radar data, the airplanes converged with about a 50-degree angle relative to their longitudinal axes, and the collision angle between the two airplanes was 80 degrees relative to the horizontal plane.The radar data indicated that, before the Cessna 172RG initiated the clearing turns, the pilots in both airplanes should have been able to see the other airplane in the distance. However, the pilot of the Cessna 172RG would not necessarily have recognized that the Cessna 172M was climbing.

For the final maneuver of the demonstration, each of the first four airplanes performed a \"pop up break,\" in order to return for landing. The fifth airplane, however, continued straight ahead in a slight descent, and did not pull up or \"break.\" The airplane continued in a constant descent, with the wings level and in a slight nose down attitude. The airplane impacted the ground and erupted in flames. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures. A Review of the pilot's personal and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical documents revealed that the pilot had falsified information on at least three applications for medical certification regarding his evaluation and treatment for cardiac conditions. The FAA denied his application for a medical certificate when it became aware of the falsification, and the pilot submitted medical records in order to regain his medical certificate. Those medical records documented, in part, a long history of exertional chest pain with normal coronary arteries by cardiac catheterization, an enlarged heart, intermittent atrial fibrillation treated with a blood thinner and a beta-blocker medication to reduce heart rate, and use of an alpha-blocker medication that also reduced blood pressure. After submission of those records, the pilot was granted (approximately 14 months prior to the accident) an Authorization for Special Issuance of a (second-class) medical with a requirement to not operate an aircraft if he had new symptoms or changed medication. No restrictions were placed by the FAA on the pilot with regard to aerobatic flight, though records submitted to the FAA clearly noted the pilot's participation in aggressive flying at airshows. The aviation medical examiner (AME) who issued the pilot's most recent medical certificate approximately 8 1/2 months prior to the accident was also a pilot who had previously participated in formation flights with the accident pilot in the accident airplane make and model. There was additional information pertinent to the pilot's condition available prior to his most recent medical certification that was not submitted to the FAA or the AME by the pilot or his cardiologist, but the FAA clearly had sufficient information to justify restricting the pilot from commercial and/or aerobatic flight. Following his most recent medical certification, in the 6 months prior to the accident, the pilot had experienced increasing symptoms (treated by increases in his beta-blocker dose), and had received at least one new diagnosis (pulmonary hypertension). Additionally, the pilot had visited his cardiologist 3 days prior to the accident, complaining of multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation over the previous three months with fatigue and shortness of breath lasting anywhere from several hours to up to 36 hours at a time. At the time of the accident, the pilot had completed over 15 minutes of high performance flight, including nearly two minutes of increased G-loading (up to 2.9G), and had just completed the longest sustained-G maneuver of the show (30 seconds of 2G loading).",

The destination area was covered by a marine cloud layer, with cloud tops of 5,500 feet. En route, the pilot cruised at 7,000 feet. Initially, all air traffic control (ATC) communications with the pilot were routine. An airport located about 6 miles from the accident site reported a broken sky condition at 2,500 and 3,100 feet, and an overcast sky condition at 4,800 feet. As the pilot entered this area, located about 29 miles north of his destination, he informed the terminal radar approach controller that he was descending from 6,200 to 4,000 feet msl. A radar controller acknowledged the pilot's statement. Two and one-quarter minutes later the radar controller instructed the pilot to descend to 2,600 feet, and \"keep your speed up.\"  About 5 seconds later, the pilot responded \"two thous.\" The remainder of the pilot's transmission was either interrupted or not recorded, and there were no further communications with the pilot. A review of the recorded radar data and the wreckage distribution evidence indicated that the airplane broke apart after entering instrument meteorological conditions. The structural failure occurred while the airplane was descending at 6,000 feet per minute and in a clockwise turn. The subsequent examination of the airplane revealed that both wings failed in an upward (positive G) direction, consistent with a pilot-induced structural overload.

Forty-five minutes after the last day landing, he took off for a night flight. During the first attempted landing, he misjudged the flare, and the airplane bounced. He subsequently performed a go-around and again misjudged the landing flare. The airplane subsequently bounced hard on the runway, which resulted in a flat nosewheel tire and firewall and right main landing gear damage. Although examination of the right main landing gear leg revealed several manufacturing defects that have since been addressed by the landing gear leg manufacturer, the accident was likely caused by the pilot\u2019s misjudged landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing and the subsequent right main landing gear damage.

The flight instructor stated that the helicopter abruptly yawed to the left.  He reported that he transitioned to a shallow approach and executed a run-on landing without further damage to the helicopter.  A post-incident inspection revealed that the cable connecting the right anti-torque pedal to the tail rotor assembly had failed.  The failure point was located in the tail boom at the pulley installed immediately forward of bulkhead 5.  The opposite cable, connecting the left anti-torque pedal to the tail rotor assembly, showed signs of wear at the same location.  Both cable assemblies were removed and replaced.  The manufacturer's inspection procedures required review of the tail rotor cables for wear and proper tension every 100 hours.  Replacement was based on cable condition.  Due to this incident, the operator has indicated that they plan to replace the tail rotor control cables every 300 - 400 hours regardless of condition.  The helicopter was originally certified with a fairlead configuration at the point at which the tail rotor control cables pass through the aft bulkhead.  A production design change subsequently revised this to a pulley configuration due to indications of cable wear at the fairleads.  This pulley configuration was installed on the incident aircraft.  A logbook entry or major alteration record (FAA form 337) denoting retrofit of the pulley configuration on the incident aircraft was not found. The manufacturer released a service bulletin requiring operators of F-28F, 280F and 280FX model Enstrom helicopters, produced and type certified with the pulley configuration, to inspect the tail rotor control cables for signs of accelerated wear.  Since the incident helicopter was an F-28C, the inspection outlined in the service bulletin was not applicable and, therefore, was not performed.  Enstrom has reissued the service bulletin in order to include earlier model helicopters which have been modified to include the pulleys.  Several FAA Service Difficulty Reports related to wear of the tail rotor control cables have been filed by mechanics.  Reports indicated replacement of cables at 300 - 400 hour intervals has been required due to wear.",
