The survey was to be done in accordance with a grid pattern, at an altitude of 1000 feet.  Once whales were spotted, the flight would descend to 500 to 750 feet, with flaps extended to 10 to 20 degrees, and right turns using a 45-degree bank would be conducted.  According to recorded radar data, the flight departed from the grid pattern and did right circling turns in a one mile radius at 1000 feet.  The flight descended and leveled at 800 feet before descending to 500 feet with a ground speed of 61 knots last recorded.  Toxicological testing on the pilot revealed:  0.008 ug/ml dextromethorphan detected in blood, dextromethorphan present in urine, ephedrine detected in blood and urine, phenylpropanolamine detected in urine, pseudoephedrine detected in blood and urine.  The presence of these drugs indicated the pilot likely used at least one medication for upper respiratory symptoms and one herbal supplement (possibly ephedra) within the 24 hours preceding the accident;  however, the pilot was probably not impaired by these substances.

A post-accident inspection of the engine determined that the carburetor had separated from the engine in cruise flight, due to the fact that there were no longer any nuts on any of the four carburetor mount retaining lug bolts. The carburetor mounting flange holes all remained intact, and none of the four mounting bolts showed any signs of damaged or distorted threads.

The pilot increased the mixture setting to \"full rich\", and applied carburetor heat, but the engine continued to lose power.  He was unable to maintain altitude and executed a forced landing to a service road on Interstate 10.

There was a post impact fire.  The airplane was loaded with a pilot, three passengers, luggage, miscellaneous items, and fuel.  A determination of the amount of fuel on board could not be made.  If the airplane took off with full fuel, it would have been over gross weight with the center of gravity outside of the envelope (aft).  With 30 gallons of fuel on board, the airplane would have been within the gross weight; however, it would still have been out of the center of gravity envelope (aft).  The pilot and front seat passenger were fatally injured.  The rear seat passengers survived.  The rear seat passengers indicated that on the morning of the accident the airplane was turned so that the sun could melt the ice on the wings.  They went to eat and when they returned, they noted a layer of 1/4- to 1/2-inch of ice still covering the airplane.  The pilot and two passengers removed some of the ice from the wings and tail sections; however, the rear seat passengers reported that no ladders were used to remove the ice from the tops of the wings.  The weather conditions during the preceding 24 hours were conducive for the formation of frost, snow, and ice on the lifting surfaces of the airplane.  Numerous witnesses observed 1/4- to 1/2-inch of snow and ice on the surfaces of other airplanes parked at various spots on the airport the morning of the accident.  Public deicing facilities were not available at the airport.  Investigators noted no mechanical discrepancies during the engine inspection that would have precluded it from producing power, and no discrepancies were found with the airframe.  Research has shown that that frost, snow, and ice accumulations on the leading edge or upper surface of the wing, no thicker or rougher than a piece of coarse sandpaper, can reduce lift by 30 percent and increase drag up to 40 percent.  Larger accretions [of snow, ice, or frost] can reduce lift even more and can increase drag by 80 percent or more.

The engine was running smoothly, with no vibrations.  About 35 to 40 seconds later, there was a loud explosion, and blue and yellow flames emanated from both sides of the engine compartment.  The pilot turned the airplane towards a field he had seen earlier.  During the turn, there was a second explosion.  The engine, which had continued to run smoothly after the first explosion, quit.

Upon reaching 10,000 feet, the crew reset the BSCU per the cockpit operational manual (COM); however, the BSCU channel 2 fault returned and they could not turn off the auto brakes, nor could they change the brake setting from \u201cMaximum.\u201d The crew confirmed that they had \u201cyellow\u201d brake pressure (alternate brakes and parking brake), and believed that they would be landing with alternate brakes. Because turning the antiskid and nosewheel steering to the \u201cOff\u201d position would also turn off maximum braking, they discussed landing with the antiskid and nosewheel steering selected \u201cOff\u201d if necessary. When the crew extended the landing gear during the first approach, they received a landing gear shock absorber fault indication and the auto throttles and autopilot turned off. The crew then contacted air traffic control (ATC) and requested a climb to assess the situation. The captain stated that the landing gear remained down and the flaps were raised. The first officer continued to perform the procedures in the COM and contacted maintenance control to inform them of the landing gear shock absorber fault. The autopilot and auto throttles remained inoperative. The flight crew then requested and received vectors to final approach. The captain stated that they set the flaps to full and completed the landing checklist. He stated that they planned to keep the brake pressure low during the landing and continue the landing roll with manual braking until they came to a stop. They then intended to turn the nosewheel steering on and taxi to the gate. The captain stated they anticipated an uneventful landing and did not advise ATC of the situation. After landing, the crew felt a vibration when the nosewheel touched down and ATC informed them of flames near the nose gear. The airplane came to rest on the runway with the nose gear strut turned 90 degrees to the direction of landing. The lower half of both the nose gear tire and wheel assembly was ground away due to runway contact. The nose gear was the only part of the airplane that sustained damage.Postincident examination and testing of the nose landing gear systems revealed an unidentified and intermittent failure of an integrated circuit on the BSCU monitor board. This failure most likely resulted in frozen BSCU System 1 analog and discrete outputs. If the BSCU System 1 commands had frozen, the BSCU System 2 would have been able to detect the System 1 failure but would not have been able to take control. As a result of this incident, the aircraft and the nose gear manufacturers established a program intended to increase the reliability of the BSCU.

The speed calculated by the flight management system (FMS) was 230 knots, 5 knots above the Vmin speed for the configuration and weight of the airplane.  Both pilots expected the FMS to automatically default to the ICAO maximum holding speed of 265 knots, as described in the company flight manual.  However, the captain decided to command the FMS to maintain 240 knots to increase the buffer between the holding speed and Vmin. Upon reaching the pattern fix, the airplane automatically banked left to enter holding and the captain noticed that the airspeed was lessening from 240 knots.  He expected the airspeed to recover once the turn was completed.  He also expected the bank to be limited to 15 degrees, but the autopilot actually commanded 23 degrees.  Upon completing the turn, the airspeed was approximately 5 knots below Vmin. The captain expected the airspeed to recover now that the airplane was wings level.  However, this did not occur, and when appropriate, the airplane started to automatically turn to the inbound holding heading. The crew then requested and was granted a clearance to descend to FL320 in the holding pattern.  The captain then selected level change on the FMS to 320 and he also reduced the autobank controller to 15 degrees, from 23 degrees. During the descending turn, with the airspeed at about 220 knots, the first officer recommended extending the slats.  The maximum slat extension speed at that juncture was 270 knots, according to the captain.  When the slats extended, the maximum slat extension speed indicator on the airspeed indicator fell to below 220 knots.  The captain then immediately ordered the first officer to retract the slats.  He stated that at this point the airplane began to buffet, and an autoslat extension alert occurred.  The first officer requested a further descent and was cleared to FL290.  The captain then selected a level change on the FMS to 290.  The buffeting ceased when the airplane was passing approximately FL300 during this descent.  The flight landed uneventfully; however, the buffeting had caused substantial damage to both elevators and right horizontal stabilizer that was discovered during a post-flight inspection. According to the flight data recorder data and an analysis of that data by the airplane\u2019s manufacturer, the slats were extended by the flight crew when the airspeed was 205 knots, well below the maximum slat extension speed of 260 knots.  However the Mach number at that time was 0.59, well above the 0.51 Mach minimum slat extension speed.  The target Mach then became 0.51, and the autothrottles reduced from 100% N1 rpm to about 50% N1 rpm.   When the slats were retracted by the flight crew, the autothrottles advanced the thrust back to 100% N1 rpm.  However, by the time the engine thrust had recovered, the airspeed had dropped to about 180 knots.  The stick shakers activated about 5 seconds later and continued to operate for approximately one minute.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight crew's failure to adequately monitor the airplane's airspeed during the holding pattern, leading to the onset of an aerodynamic stall and subsequent structural damage to the tail from buffet."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The helicopter was descending to the planned destination during the on-demand air taxi flight when witnesses reported hearing a loud pop, followed by flames emitting from the back of the engine. The helicopter subsequently collided with the ground.A surviving passenger reported that just after the loud pop, the pilot told passengers that he was going to autorotate. The helicopter entered a descent at an altitude witnesses on the ground estimated at 200 to 400 feet above ground level. During the descent, the pilot had to clear numerous obstacles, including buildings and power lines, to reach an open field located beyond the obstacles but short of the normal landing area. The ground witnesses stated that the helicopter was in an area near the shoreline when they witnessed the flames and heard the loud pop; however, the exact location in reference to the shoreline could not be determined.Since the pilot stated to passengers that he was going to autorotate, it is likely that the helicopter experienced a loss of power after the loud pop. In the event of a loss of engine power, the pilot must enter an autorotation by immediately reducing the collective pitch to maintain main rotor speed to avoid a main rotor stall. The collective pitch must be reduced to the point required to maintain, or regain a safe main rotor speed. This would allow the pilot to maintain sufficient rotor speed while maneuvering to a suitable landing area, and to arrest the descent when needed.  If the main rotor blades stall, this will ultimately result in a loss of control and uncontrolled descent.Because of the relatively low altitude at which the loss of power occurred, it is likely that the accident pilot had to trade rotor rpm to maintain the altitude needed to clear the obstacles and reach the open field. This would have resulted in a lack of sufficient rotor rpm to arrest the helicopter\u2019s descent rate as it approached the ground.  Further, examination of the main rotor blades at the accident scene did not show evidence of high rotational energy at impact.Postaccident inspection of the turbine engine revealed localized damage to four consecutive power turbine blades. Two of the blades were fractured transversely across the airfoil above the blade root platform and two were fractured higher up their respective airfoils near the blade tips. Generalized damage was observed to the remaining power turbine blades; however, all blades were in place and remained secured to the power turbine wheel. A Safety Board materials engineer's examination of the fractured blades revealed striation features typical of fatigue cracking on the pressure (concave) side of the airfoil. The fatigue crack features emanated from the boundary area between the base material and a casting pin. Further analysis disclosed that the fracture was the result of fatigue cracking that emanated from two platinum casting pins on the pressure side of the blade adjacent to the platform. The fracture face of the blade contained isolated regions of fatigue cracking that were separated by fracture regions and showed oxidation damage consistent with fatigue. Additional testing of the fractured blade(s) indicated that the microstructure in the airfoil portions showed no evidence of operation above a temperature profile expected for this stage of the engine. The fracture features of the remaining turbine blades were consistent with overstress separation. Review of maintenance records indicated that, the engine's cycle counting process, inspection requirements, and compliance with airworthiness directives and service bulletins were all satisfactory. More specifically, due to the power turbine blade failures, the life and maintenance history of the power turbine rotor, including the power turbine blades, were assessed. The information contained in the maintenance records, as well as the information provided by the manufacturer on the history and inspection requirements of the power turbine blades showed that they were operated in accordance with the requirements set forth by the manufacturer.\\Following the accident, Honeywell Aerospace issued Service Bulletins; LT 101-71-00-0252 and LTS101-71-00-0253. The Service Bulletins require the removal and inspection of the turbine assemblies, \"To address a service related difficulty with Power Turbine Rotor Blade Part No. 4-141-084-06 cracking at the mid span of the airfoil that can lead to a blade separation and subsequent inability to maintain powered flight resulting in potential injuries and damage to the aircraft.\"Additionally, two FAA Airworthiness Directives pertaining to this issue are pending.",

The pilots were members of the German Air Force (GAF) and the flight was a low level navigation mission as part of an initial air force pilot training course.  The flight syllabus called for the flight to complete the route at 500 feet agl.  Another airplane with two GAF instructors aboard departed immediately after the accident airplane.  The two instructors in the second airplane initially flew north of the standard route and then turned south to intercept it.  They were about 1,500 agl.  As they turned south, they observed the accident airplane proceeding on a southeasterly course.  Both instructors said that they were looking down at the other airplane, and both estimated its altitude was 500 to 700 agl.  Both instructors said the accident airplane was in straight and level flight on a southeasterly heading.  As the airplane crossed the ridge, the airplane went from straight and level to a 30- to 40-degree angle of bank.  The bank angle seemed to increase to 60 degrees and continued to 135 degrees as the nose went down.  It appeared to the pilot in the left seat that the maneuver was abrupt, but he saw nothing to account for it.  He didn't observe any obstacles to avoid, any smoke or flames coming from the airplane prior to impact, and he did not see anything falling from the airplane.  The weather was clear and there was no turbulence.  The airplane came to rest in an upright position.  Vegetation ranging between 3 and 20 feet in height, and within 5 to 30 feet both behind and in front of the wreckage, was scorched but undamaged.  Examination of the wreckage and ground scars disclosed that the airplane impacted the hillside in an attitude level with the slope and with a large vertical energy vector.

On the day of the accident, after flying locally for about 3 hours, the glider was about 1 mile from the departure airport when witnesses reported that the glider started rolling back and forth into 90-degree banks. After three or four rolls, the glider descended nose-down to the ground and impacted a field in a flat attitude. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.\u000b\u000bAbout 3 years before the accident, the pilot underwent a procedure to repair an aneurysm of the ascending aorta combined with placement of a single vessel coronary artery bypass graft. He subsequently received a medical certificate and reported the surgery and that he was taking metoprolol (a beta blocker used to treat hypertension and prevent heart attacks), simvastatin (a cholesterol lowering drug), and lisinopril (a blood pressure medicine). Although the pilot\u2019s medical certificate had expired about 1 month before the accident, he was not required to possess a current medical certificate as a glider pilot. Before the accident flight, the pilot remarked to a friend that he was not feeling well. The friend added that the day was very hot and that the pilot did not drink water before the flight or bring any water with him. Autopsy results indicated that there was no evidence to suggest any direct effect of the pilot\u2019s cardiovascular disease (heart attack) in his ability to control the glider. \u000b\u000bToxicological testing revealed levels of diphenhydramine in the pilot\u2019s blood that were well above therapeutic levels.

Birds in Paradise, LLC., owned by the accident pilot, was operating the trike under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The certified light sport instructor and student pilot sustained fatal injuries; the trike was destroyed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the instructional flight. The trike departed Port Allen Airport, Hanapepe, Hawaii about 0850 and the introductory flight was intended to take 60 minutes before returning to the airport.A second Birds in Paradise certificated flight instructor (CFI) was giving instruction in another trike while flying in close proximity with the accident trike. He stated that about 0615 that morning he met up with the accident pilot at the company's facilities. They began to take their respective trikes out of the hangar and he noticed the accident pilot was on a ladder routing compressed air into the accident trike's fuel vent. The second pilot commented to the accident pilot that the fuel cap was still affixed on the tank and removed it for him, which produced a \"pop\" sound from the compressed air escaping the system. They wheeled the trikes over to the staging area and greeted their student pilots shortly thereafter. After fitting the students with flight suits and helmets, the pilots gave them a briefing and departed around 0850. After departure, the accident pilot told the second pilot that he was going \"on company,\" meaning that they would communicate to one another on the company frequency 123.450; this was the last transmission the CFI heard from the accident pilot. Approaching the Barking Sands class D airspace, the second pilot transmitted over the company frequency that he was switching to the Barking Sands frequency to receive a clearance from the control tower, to transition through their airspace as a flight of two. As the CFI's trike was approaching the northwest side of Polihale Beach , he descended to about 600 feet above ground level (agl) and observed the accident trike about 1,000 feet agl and 75 feet away horizontally at his 1-o'clock position; that was the last time he saw the accident trike flying. The CFI and his student performed two near-360 degree turns over the ocean and attempted to contact the accident pilot over the radio. They noticed smoke on the base of the ridgeline and maneuvered over to the area. The trike came to rest at the base of a ridgeline about one nautical mile east of Polihale State Park. The main wreckage was consumed by fire but all major structural components were located within the wreckage debris area. The accident pilot had recently had problems with the fuel system suctioning the fuel supply out of the main vent line (located in the belly of the aircraft). In an effort to rectify the problem, he routed the vent line up the mast and through the keel pocket toward the trailing edge. The wreckage and a camera were recovered for further examination.",

The pilot did not use carburetor heat since the checklist said to only apply it \"as necessary\" and there was no indication of carburetor icing. As the airplane turned on to the base leg, the engine stopped producing power and the pilot made a forced landing to a plowed field. During the landing the airplane nosed over. The engine was later test run on the airplane using fuel from the right wing tank. The engine started immediately and ran smoothly. No anomalies were noted except that when carburetor heat was applied a drop followed by a rise in rpm was noted, which is consistent with ice buildup in the carburetor.

They next performed some stuck-pedal exercises on a parallel taxiway, and then performed a series of run-on landings to runway 30. The last maneuver was a full-down autorotation to runway 30. The maneuver was initiated about 300 feet above ground level (agl), and the flare was started about 50 feet agl. According to both the student and the instructor, the flare and touchdown were performed correctly, and were uneventful. The helicopter then slid directly down the runway for about 150 feet, but just prior to coming to a normal stop (at about five knots), the left skid sank into some soft tar on the runway surface. The helicopter then veered abruptly to the left, and rolled over onto its right side. When the occupants got out of the helicopter, they found that the tar in the area where the aircraft rolled over was thick, soft, and sticky. In a post accident interview, both the student and the instructor said that when they departed Medford for Ashland, they were not aware that the Ashland Airport runway surface was made of chip-seal (a combination of tar and crushed rock). According to the instructor, although the runway surface did not seem to present any problem during the run-on landings, he did notice that when they came around the pattern for subsequent maneuvers that he could see imprints in the surface from the previous skid contacts. The instructor further noted that the temperature at the time of the accident was just over 90 degrees, and that on the previous two days the temperature had reached about 100 degrees.

The commercial pilot, and three passengers were fatally injured, and another passenger was seriously injured. Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the personal flight which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight departed Tallahassee Regional Airport (TLH), Tallahassee, Florida, around 1600 eastern standard time, with the intended destination of Mount Vernon Airport (MVN), Mount Vernon, Illinois.Preliminary information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that at 1750, the pilot contacted air traffic control and requested vectors to the nearest airport in visual flight rules (VFR) weather conditions due to \"problems\" with both engines. The controller advised him that Kentucky Dam State (M34) was 11 miles west of his position. The pilot announced he had the airport in sight, and that the airplane's right engine had stopped producing power. The controller then cleared the airplane for a visual approach. The pilot acknowledged the clearance, advised that he had lost sight of the airport, and asked for the airport common traffic advisory frequency. There were no further radio communications from the airplane. At 1755, after several attempts to contact the airplane, the controller advised that radar contact was lost. The airplane was last observed descending through 2,700 feet approximately 10 miles west of M34.According to FAA records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, multiengine land, and instrument airplane. In addition, the pilot held a flight instructor certificate for airplane single engine, multiengine, and instrument airplane. His most recent third-class medical certificate was issued on February 4, 2014. On that date, the pilot reported 2,300 hours of total flight experience, of which, 50 hours were in the previous six months. According to FAA records, the airplane was manufactured in 1979 and was registered to a corporation on October 29, 2012. It was equipped with two Continental Motors Inc. TSIO-360-series, 210- horsepower engines, with two 2-bladed Hartzell controllable pitch propellers. The most recent annual inspection was performed on March 16, 2014, and at 7573.4 total aircraft hours. The airplane came to rest inverted with the landing gear retracted, and was examined at the accident site on January 4, 2015. There was a strong odor of fuel, and all major components of the airplane were accounted for at the scene. The wreckage path was oriented 228 degrees, was approximately 300 feet in length, at 480 feet elevation. The fuselage and empennage were largely intact, but heavily damaged by impact. The right outboard fuel tank was destroyed by impact and displayed evidence of a small post-crash fire. Flight control continuity was confirmed from all flight control surfaces to the cockpit through tensile overload breaks and cuts made by recovery personnel. Examination of the cockpit and cabin areas revealed that both control yokes were attached to their respective columns and that the throttle, mixture, and propeller levers were intact in the throttle quadrant, and in the full forward position. The seats were anchored in their mounts, the seatbelts were buckled, and all were cut by rescue personnel with one exception. The forward-facing right aft seat belt was intact and unbuckled.The left engine was separated from all engine mounts but remained attached to the left wing through wires and cables. The left engine turbocharger was removed from the engine and examined. Rotational scoring was noted on the interior of the turbocharger near the turbine vanes. The left propeller was separated from the left engine and was in the vicinity of the main wreckage. The propeller blades exhibited a slight s-bend on one blade and the other exhibited chordwise scratching. The spinner was impact damaged. The right engine remained attached to all engine mounts and was attached to the right wing. The engine cowl was removed to facilitate further examination. All major engine components remained attached to the engine. The right propeller was separated from the right engine and was located forward of and in the vicinity of the right engine. The right propeller spinner exhibited impact damage and both propeller blades were bent in the aft direction. The airplane was recovered from the site, and fuel was noted draining from the ruptured fuel tanks. A detailed examination of the airplane was conducted in Springfield, Tennessee, on January 5, 2015. The right engine was removed from its nacelle, and prepared for shipment and examination at a later date. A Garmin 696 GPS, a Garmin 496 GPS, and an iPhone were also retained for examination at a later date. According to Lockheed-Martin Flight Service, they did not provide any type of services to the pilot on the day of the accident. However, the pilot filed his IFR flight plan around 1540 eastern standard time with an online commercial vendor prior to departure, but there was no evidence that a weather briefing was obtained at that time.A preliminary examination of weather data by an NTSB Senior meteorologist revealed a forecast of IFR conditions along the entire route of flight. In addition, Airman's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisories for IFR, icing, and mountain obscuration conditions were in effect around the time of the accident. At 1753, the weather conditions reported at Barkley Regional Airport (PAH), an airport approximately 29 miles west of the accident location, indicated wind from 060 degrees at 6 knots, visibility 6 statute miles in mist, ceiling overcast at 600 feet above ground level (agl), temperature and dew point 3 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.22 inches of mercury.

No information about the MET was distributed in any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) notices or other publications for pilots, and the MET was not equipped with any markings or obstruction lights for visual conspicuity. For these reasons, the pilot likely had limited opportunity to become aware of the MET before the flight, and his ability to detect it visually in flight was extremely limited. Although the pilot\u2019s toxicological results were positive for dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough suppressant) and dextrorphan (a metabolite of dextromethorphan) in the urine, the substances were not noted in the blood; therefore, it is likely that some time had passed since the pilot had used the medication. Additionally, these substances would not normally be expected to result in any impairment.METs are used to measure wind data throughout the United States. They can be assembled quickly and can be constructed of galvanized tubing with guy wires used as support. Because many METs (like the accident MET) are just below the 200-foot threshold at which FAA regulations would require the applicant to notify the FAA of the MET and to provide a lighting and marking plan for FAA assessment, many METs are unmarked, unlighted, and not referenced in any FAA notices or publications for pilots. Although the FAA in 2011 approved an update to Advisory Circular (AC) 70/7460-1K, Obstruction Marking and Lighting, that will provide recommended guidance on marking METs, ACs are only advisory in nature. Because of this, MET constructions will likely continue to meet only the minimum requirements and, thus, will remain a hazard to pilots operating at low altitudes. In March 2011, the NTSB published Safety Alert SA-016 to educate pilots about the flight-safety issues presented by METs.

The pilot reported that just after lift-off the left wing stalled, and the airplane settled to the ground.  He said that he realized after touchdown he would be unable to stop the airplane before reaching the end of the site, so he elected to make a hard turn to the left in an attempt to ground loop the airplane.  During the ground loop, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the right wing struck the ground.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.  In the pilot's written statement to the NTSB, the pilot wrote, in part: \"It is believed that we lost a cylinder, will confirm when able to do a test.\" On January 14, 2004, a  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector examined the accident airplane and engine after the airplane had been recovered from the accident site.

About 10 seconds after the student pilot lifted the helicopter into a stable hover with a left crosswind, the helicopter began a slow yaw to the right that the student was unable to arrest through the application of the left anti-torque pedal. As the rate of the yaw increased, the flight instructor took control of the helicopter and attempted to stop the yaw with the application of additional left anti-torque pedal, to no avail. The flight instructor then reduced engine power, arresting the yaw, and performed an autorotation to the ground after an estimated 1 3/4 total revolutions.

Post-accident examination of the aircraft and engines provided no evidence of a malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation of the engines.  Review of the closest weather facility's recorded weather data (located 17 nautical miles away) revealed the flight had a likely headwind of 11 knots and a computed density altitude of 4,903 feet.  The calculated performance data revealed that the airplane should have been able to climb about a rate of 850 feet/minute with both engines operative and at normal climb speed of 109 miles/hour.",

Although the 747 crew did not have the 172 in sight, the flight instructor in the 172 spotted the 747 soon after being advised of its presence by the tower. The instructor maintained visual contact with the descending 747, and as the 747 neared a point where it would pass the 172, the instructor elected to continue the VFR approach at about the same altitude and on the same course as before. The instructor then watched as the still-descending 747 passed upwind of the 172 at a slightly higher altitude than the 172 was at. When the 747 reached a point about one-quarter mile in front of the 172, the 172 encountered the wake vortices from the 747, and immediately departed controlled flight. Recovery was completed about 150 feet above the terrain. At the time that the 747 passed the 172, the instructor was aware that there was a nine knot wind blowing almost directly across the parallel flight paths of the two aircraft, and although the instructor had requested a low approach at the runway, the instructor did not take evasive action when the 747 passed the 172 while on approach.",

While on the 45-degree approach to the downwind leg, he turned on the fuel boost pump and switched the fuel selector from the left tank to the right tank, since the checklist called for switching the fuel selector to the fullest tank. During the flare, the airplane was descending too fast, and a gust of wind caused it to drift left, so the pilot initiated a go-around. As the airplane was making a climbing, left-crosswind turn at 500 feet above ground level, the engine made a loud \u201cpopping sound\u201d and immediately lost all power. The pilot initiated a forced landing and attempted to restart the engine but was not successful. The airplane hit trees and power lines before it came to rest inverted. The postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the fuel tank selector valve was in a partial OFF position (between the right tank and OFF position). When the valve was rotated, it was stiff to move and there were no apparent detents for either the fuel tanks or the OFF position. A teardown of the fuel selector valve revealed that the inside of the valve contained dirt and contamination, and that the position washer was worn. The airplane manufacturer issued Service Bulletin No. 355 on June 5, 1972, that stated: \u201cInspect position washer to ascertain that it will not allow the valve to rotate beyond its stop positions. Also, inspect position washer inner perimeter surface for indications of extreme wear; should this be evident, replace position washer.\u201d The service bulletin called for repetition of this inspection at 100-hour intervals and for replacement of the position washer if the valve was difficult to rotate or if the washer did not allow the valve to rotate beyond the stop position. The fuel tank selector valve was reassembled and tested with the fuel selector handle in the same position as it was found at the accident site. The test indicated that the stream of fluid exiting the fuel selector valve was at a greatly reduced flow rate as compared to when the handle was positioned on the left or right fuel tank. The test indicated that there was not enough fuel flow to the engine at maximum power used during the go-around, which resulted in the engine\u2019s total loss of power. The pilot reported that when he switched the fuel selector valve from the left tank to the right tank during the accident flight, he did not look to confirm the position of the lever. ",

The fuel quantity gauges indicated decreasing quantity of fuel during the flights and the gauges indicated more than 1/2, and less then 1/4 respectively sometime during the last flight.  The accident pilot relieved the pilot who had flown the 10 sightseeing flights, at that time the airplane had been operated for 3.75 hours since fueling.  The accident pilot reported he visually checked the fuel tanks though all the adult passengers stated he did not.  The flight departed and at 200 feet msl, the pilot later stated that the engine quit when he reduced power to 25 inches manifold pressure.  He maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing in a field, and touched down with full flaps at an indicated airspeed of 80 knots.  The airplane touched down, the nose landing gear separated from the airplane, and the airplane then collided with a 6-8 feet high sand dune.  The airplane came to rest inverted on top of the sand dune.  Examination of the fuel lines at the fuel selector valve, at each reservoir fuel tank, and at the fuel control unit revealed no fuel.  No fuel was found in the auxiliary fuel pump, engine driven fuel pump, or reservoir tanks.  The fuel selector was found positioned to the right fuel tank which was calculated to contain 7 gallons of fuel; the unusable amount of fuel in the tank is 3.5 gallons.  The engine was placed on a test stand, impact damaged components were replaced or repaired and the engine was started and found to operate normally, no discrepancies were noted.  Testing of the fuel gauges revealed they were operative.  Testing of the fuel transmitters revealed several discrepancies.  The average fuel consumption over a 9-day period was 15.14 gallons per hour; the airplane had been operated for 3.79 hours since fueling at the time of the accident.  The operator had a procedure in place that required the pilot to dip the tanks during preflight and the chief pilot to randomly dip the tanks during the day; the pilot did not dip the tank before the flight and the chief pilot did not randomly dip the tanks throughout the day.  The dipstick used to dip the tanks was in fact a wooden paint stirrer with a \"full\" mark annotated.  No graduate marks beneath the full mark was noted.

During the forced landing, the airplane landed hard, nosed-over and came to rest in the inverted position.  Examination of the engine revealed that the input fuel line to the fuel transducer was not  properly torqued during the manufacturing process and had loosened to the point where the engine was starved of fuel.

            "narrative": "On April 11, 2015, about 1307 eastern daylight time, an Aeronca 7AC, N82658, was substantially damaged during landing rollout when the right main landing gear collapsed after a loss of power and forced landing near Spring City, Tennessee. The private pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 which departed Western Carolina Regional Airport (RHP) Andrews, North Carolina destined for Warren County Memorial Airport (RNC), McMinnville, Tennessee.According to the pilot, the purpose of the flight was to return the airplane to his home airport, as the airplane had been at RHP since August of 2014 having the fabric covering replaced and receiving an annual inspection.The pilot and his wife had driven over to RHP on the day before the accident. On the morning of the accident at approximately 0824 the pilot called the RHP automatic weather observing system to check on the weather conditions that existed at the airport.  The weather forecast called for a slight wind from the NNE with clear visibility and barometric pressure reading of 30.20. He advised that he had chosen this day to pick up the airplane due to a clear national weather service forecast with low wind speeds for both RHP and RNC.He arrived at RHP at approximately 1000 to preflight the airplane.  After meeting with the maintenance provider's personnel and picking up the airplane's logbooks, they pushed the Champ out of the hangar and conducted a preflight walk around check. The pilot then taxied the airplane to the fixed base operator's facility and topped off the fuel.  After fueling was completed, the pilot started the engine and taxied out to Runway 8 and performed a pretakeoff procedure check. The pilot advised that the wind was basically calm (3 to 5 knots from the northeast).   Then after the pre-takeoff check was performed, he took off.  He flew a right hand traffic pattern three times, making three takeoff and landings (two three point landings and one wheel landing) to ensure all was well for the upcoming flight to RNC.  The pilot stated that \"the champ performed flawlessly.\"He taxied back to the maintenance provider's facility, to indicate all was well.  After a brief discussion about how great the airplane was flying, the pilot then started the engine, taxied out, did another pre-takeoff check and then departed at approximately 1200 for RNC.The pilot further stated that since RHP lies in a valley, you must fly the valley at Vx (50mph) best angle of climb to gain altitude to clear the mountains.  He climbed to 6,500 feet above mean sea level (msl) and then flew over them. Once he was out of the mountains he decreased engine rpm and leveled off at an altitude of approximately 2,500 feet msl and flew at a cruise speed of 74 knots indicated airspeed at 2,150 rpm for approximately 30 minutes.  When he was approximately 50 nautical miles from RNC, an increase in altitude was needed to climb over the Cumberland Plateau at a safe altitude.  He applied climb power and the engine started sputtering and losing rpm.   The oil pressure gauge and temperature instruments indicated that oil temperature and pressure were fine, so he applied carburetor heat. The engine rpm then increased and he gained altitude momentarily, but the engine started sputtering again, and this time, the carburetor heat had no effect. He then checked  the fuel cutoff value to make sure it had not moved to  the off position, then quickly checked the magnetos by rotating the magneto switch from \"both to left and then back to right\".  No change in the engine sputtering was noticed when moving the switch from left magneto to the right magneto so he moved it back to both.  He also checked his fuel quantity by visually looking at the fuel gauge, and cork fuel float gauge which was physically located on the fuel tank. Both indicated that almost a half a tank of fuel was left remaining.He was losing altitude, so he began to look for a place where he could land safely.  No radio transmissions were made by the pilot as he was totally devoted to flying the airplane.  He was over a populated area and he could see that people were outside. The engine was still sputtering with low rpm and he was losing altitude.  He felt he had no choice but to attempt an emergency landing.  He spotted a farmer's field with a barn on the south end of the field where two farmers were working with their cattle.  He turned north into the wind and began a glide to put it down in the field, gliding right over a barn.  His speed was a little above the Vg (60 mph) recommended landing approach glide, but he had to put it down quickly since the field was short and he had to clear the barn.  When he landed the right main landing gear collapsed and forced the right wheel up into the right wing strut which bent. The airplane then did a flat, slow, 180 degree ground loop to the right.  The pilot then unbuckled his shoulder straps and seat belt and exited the airplane.According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and pilot records, the pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on March 3, 2015. He reported that he had accrued 1,188 total hours of flight experience, 480 of which were in the accident airplane make and model.According to FAA and airplane maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 1946. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on April 4, 2015. At the time of the inspection, the airplane had accrued approximately 2134.5 total hours of operation, and the engine had accrued approximately 255.3 total hours of operation since major overhaul.",

He was advised that runway RVR was 4,000 feet (about 3/4 mile visibility), but was not provided other current weather or airport information. In preparation for the ILS, he was instructed to descend & maintain 9,000 feet, then to reduce his speed 20 knots as he was closing on an MD-80, 3 miles ahead. About 2 minutes later (without issuing a clearance for the ILS approach), the pilot was transferred to tower frequency. Soon thereafter, the tower controller advised the pilot that radar showed he had deviated from the localizer course & inquired about his intentions. The pilot said he was going to make a missed approach. To ensure separation from other traffic, the controller told the pilot to turn left to 090 degrees, climb, & maintain 9,000 feet. Seconds later, the controller noted the pilot was below minimum vectoring altitude & told him to start his climb. The pilot acknowledged. About a minute later, the controller asked the pilot for his heading; the pilot replied '...190 heading to 090.'  The controller told him to 'Start a left turn now. You're headed towards the mountains.'  The pilot acknowledged, but moments later, radio & radar contact with the airplane were lost. The airplane impacted a small hill about 5 miles north of the airport on a magnetic heading of 080 degrees. Although the pilot was certificated to fly multiengine airplanes in instrument meteorological conditions, FAA records revealed he had once failed the instrument practical test; had made an inadvertent wheels up landing in the airplane; had failed an instrument procedures refresher course; and had once failed the multiengine practical test.

The pilot initiated a return to the runway, during which time the engine lost all power. The pilot unsuccessfully attempted to restart the engine and subsequently performed an off-airport landing. The airplane's right main landing gear collapsed during the landing roll, resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. Examination of the engine revealed that the left carburetor was detached from the engine inlet manifold. The impact trajectory, coupled with a lack of witness marks indicating the carburetor had struck any part of the airplane, make it most likely that the carburetor detached in flight. The owner/pilot reported that he had experienced excessive engine vibration and \"kickback\" during prior startups. He had considered a number of remedial measures to rectify the problem, but had not performed any of these measures prior to the accident flight. He additionally reported that he could have reduced the likelihood of the carburetor separating by more thoroughly examining the tension of its mounting hardware.",
