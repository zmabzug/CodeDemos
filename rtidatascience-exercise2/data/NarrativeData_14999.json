Even though the flood lights were \"limiting\" his vision, his first landing was successful. After the first landing, the pilot hovered near the touchdown point for a few minutes, and then was cleared by the tower to proceed around the pattern for another landing. When the pilot was on short final for the second landing, while the helicopter was still about 50 feet above the ground, he saw the low rotor rpm light flicker. He therefore reduced collective and checked the rpm gage, which showed that both the engine and rotor rpm were where they should be. Soon thereafter the helicopter impacted the runway surface. The flickering of the warning light, along with the pilot's glance at the rpm gage, caused him to momentarily be distracted, and that, along with the effect of the food lights and the dark night, resulted in him not seeing the ground in time to initiate a landing flare.",

The pilot made a forced landing about 3 miles west of the airport in an open field; during the landing rollout, the airplane struck a culvert and nosed over, coming to rest inverted. The student pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured. Sierra Academy of Aeronautics operated the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as an instructional flight. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the tail section and wings. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local area flight, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight departed from MER about 1630. According to the student\u2019s written statement, he performed a weight and balance calculation and a preflight of the airplane, which included an addition of 4 quarts of oil. He also reported checking the fuel and observing that each fuel tank was 1/2 full. He flew for about 20 minutes, and then became lost. The pilot contacted NorCal approach (Northern California Terminal Radar Approach Control) for assistance back to MER. He contacted MER tower, and then reported that the engine stopped. The pilot advised tower personnel that the engine had failed and he did not have the airport insight. Tower personnel, provide him with a heading to the airport, and he located the airport. The pilot reported that he pitched for best glide speed, and realized that the airplane was too low to make it to the runway, so he decided to make a forced landing in an open field.The flight school was given permission to recover the airplane to their facility. An interview with the chief pilot revealed that upon his  arrival at the accident site, he noted no smell of fuel present and that the fuel tanks had not been compromised. Once the airplane was righted, he was able to drain a total of 1 gallon of fuel; \u00bd gallon from each wing's fuel tank.According to the 1978 Cessna pilot\u2019s operating handbook, the maximum of unusable fuel is 1.5 gallons.",

He stated that during rollout the airplane \"started to veer toward the right\" and that he \"incorrectly applied the right rudder instead of left.\"  The pilot decided to perform an aborted landing in order to \"demonstrate a better landing.\"  The pilot reported he applied full engine power and \"lifted the flaps briefly (but not fully).\"  He stated that he thought the flaps were \"up more\" and that he became \"flustered\" as the airplane \"pitched up.\"  He reported that the airplane \"stalled\" about 30-50 feet above the ground, and that he was \"able to pull the nose up so that we landed hard on the [landing] gear.\"",

Another pilot suggested that the pilot consider two airports within 5 miles.  The pilot elected to return to the home base, about 15 miles away.

The pilot had initially reserved a Cessna 172 equipped with 50-gallon fuel tanks and initially planned the trip with that airplane in mind.  His passenger called  to ask if his friend could accompany them.  The pilot stated that he would have to get back with him after checking the weight and balance.  He reworked his weight and balance calculations and determined that they would be 66 pounds over gross with full fuel, golf clubs, and an additional person.  The pilot went to the airport to check on the airplane and see how much fuel was on board.  When he got to the airport he saw that the accident airplane, which had 40-gallon fuel tanks, had just returned from a flight.  He talked to the pilot about how the airplane handled and what the fuel level was.  The pilot that had just returned in the airplane stated that it was running fine and he had flown about 1 hour 50 minutes.  The pilot recalculated the weight and balance and found that the accident airplane would be within limits with his two passengers and their baggage.  He estimated his trip time would be 3 hours with a fuel burn of 6 gallons per hour.  The pilot subtracted the 2 hours of flight time from the previous flight, in addition to his trip time of 3 hours, and calculated he would have 1.6 hours of reserve fuel on board at the completion of his trip.  The pilot determined that this would be plenty of fuel to make the trip.  Prior to takeoff the pilot conducted a preflight inspection, which included visually checking the fuel level.  The aircraft arrived at the destination after an 1 hour 15 minute flight, and the pilot did not have the airplane refueled.

The pilot, who built the airplane, stated that he designed the ignition system's electrical circuit with the intention of providing electrical redundancy to the ignition system.  Examination and testing of the design as installed demonstrated that a minor voltage differential between the main and redundant power source created a condition that routed the current flow for both ignition sources through a single fuse, resulting in a single point of failure.

Several witnesses described the accident takeoff in written statements.  When the airplane reached an altitude of approximately 100 to 150 feet, they stated the airplane pitched up to an 'extremely' nose high attitude.  Four witnesses described the pitch angle as '...well over 45 degrees...', '...45 to 60 degrees...', '...60 to 70 degrees up...', and '...60 degrees at least...'.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.Shortly before embarking on the flight, the instrument-rated pilot filed an instrument flight plan and checked the weather using a computer-based filing system. At that time, the destination airport was reporting visual meteorological conditions, with similar conditions forecast for the planned arrival time. The pilot did not list an alternate airport in the flight plan. About halfway through the flight, the pilot contacted the air traffic controller responsible for the destination airport\u2019s airspace. By that time, the weather conditions at the destination had deteriorated, with reports of snow and fog and visibility below the instrument approach minimums. The controller provided updated weather information and asked the pilot if he wanted to continue with the initial approach. He responded that he did and that he would divert to an alternate airport if necessary. The pilot was then cleared for the approach, and the airplane began to descend toward the initial approach fix (IAF).Shortly thereafter, a scheduled air carrier airplane destined for the same airport contacted the same controller. The controller relayed the weather information, and the crew of that airplane responded that they would delay the approach to see if the weather conditions improved. About that time, the accident airplane reached the IAF and began the approach. The air carrier pilot then requested and received approval to divert to an alternate airport due to the weather conditions. The accident pilot most likely did not hear this exchange because he had switched to the airport frequency. Due to limitations in radar coverage, the air traffic controller was not able to see the airplane once it had descended to the approach altitude.About 4 minutes after the air carrier airplane began to divert, the accident pilot reported that he was performing a missed approach. The controller provided missed approach instructions and asked for the pilot's intentions. The pilot read back the instructions but did not state his intentions. The controller asked if he would like to divert to the alternate airport, and, after a series of delayed and partial responses from the pilot, a call of \"Mayday Mayday\" was heard on the controller's frequency. For the next 35 minutes, the controller unsuccessfully attempted to contact the pilot. During that period, an air medical flight also canceled a landing approach into the airport due to deteriorating weather conditions. Multiple witnesses reported the sounds of a loud, low-flying airplane northwest of the airport about the time of the landing attempt. The witnesses reported the sudden onset of a gusting wind, heavy snow, low visibility, and ice accumulations during that period.The airplane wreckage was located a few miles from the witnesses, about midway between the airport and the missed approach hold location. The wreckage distribution and flight instrument readings were indicative of a high-speed, steep nose-down, left-turning descent into the ground, with a heading almost opposite the direction of the missed approach route. Engine instrument indications, and both the engine and propeller damage signatures, were consistent with the engines producing similar amounts of power at the time of impact. The airplane was equipped with instruments and systems required for flight in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and flight into known icing. Additional equipment included an autopilot and a global positioning system (GPS) navigation and communication transceiver capable of receiving and displaying current weather information via satellite. Impact damage prevented a determination of the operational status of those systems.Available ground-based radar tracking data indicated smooth heading and altitude changes and minimal altitude deviations prior to the pilot being cleared for the approach, consistent with autopilot use. According to the prior owner of the airplane, the autopilot was susceptible to becoming disengaged during turbulent conditions, and, as such, it is possible that at some point during the approach the pilot was forced to revert to flying the airplane manually. Under such circumstances, the pilot's workload would have rapidly increased. Additionally, the likely accumulation of ice on the airplane's airframe would have reduced flight performance and added to his workload as he attempted to monitor the ice accumulation and operate the deice system. The pilot had recently purchased the airplane and likely had minimal solo experience flying it in IMC.The airplane was about 2 months overdue for its annual inspection, and 12 months overdue for its transponder, static, and altitude reporting systems check. However, postaccident examination of the airframe remnants did not reveal any failures or malfunctions which would have precluded normal operation. The engines exhibited indications of wear that would have resulted in a gradual reduction in engine power over its life, rather than a sudden loss of power.Although the severe weather conditions were not forecast, the pilot was accurately advised of the deteriorating conditions by the controller prior to the approach, and he would have had access to airport terminal reports via the airplane's radio and his GPS navigation system. The lack of a filed alternate airport indicates that the pilot was not prepared for the severity of the weather conditions. The airplane was carrying ample reserves of fuel, with enough to return to the departure airport if necessary.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's loss of airplane control during the missed approach for undetermined reasons. Contributing to the accident was the rapid and unforecast deterioration of the weather conditions to below the landing minimum and the pilot's decision to attempt the approach despite his knowledge of those conditions."

The severity of the leak increased, and 5 minutes later oil had covered the front windshield thus precluding visibility.  One minute later, the pilot announced that he had \"totally lost oil pressure.\"  Prior to the engine seizing, the pilot attempted to make a forced landing on an interstate freeway.  During flare, the airplane impacted three automobiles, cartwheeled, and came to rest upside down.  Three days before the accident, the pilot had flown his airplane from Torrance, California, to Bullhead City, Arizona.  En route, an engine oil leak became evident, which inhibited the pilot's ability to see through the front windshield.  The pilot believed that engine oil was leaking past the engine's crankcase nose seal, aft of the propeller, and that replacing the seal would resolve the leakage problem.  (Seepage had been documented in this crankshaft area during the last annual inspection that was completed 21 engine operational hours earlier.)  The pilot flew 16 miles to near Needles, California, where repair services were available.  Upon arrival, oil was dripping off the engine, and the pilot was advised by an engine shop to have the engine removed and repaired.  The pilot declined indicating that he had insufficient funds.  Instead, the pilot purchased the nose seal parts from the engine shop, and he hired a local independent mechanic to install them in his airplane.  Upon completion of the maintenance, the mechanic requested that the pilot perform a ground run-up to check for leaks.  The pilot declined and took off.  The accident occurred about 40 minutes later, 92 miles from Needles.  In 1986, about 537 engine operational hours earlier, the airplane's landing gear collapsed and the propeller was damaged.  The crankcase was found cracked on its front, right side, and the engine was overhauled.  The case was repaired, according to the maintenance records.  During the last annual inspection, oil seepage was noted on the front, right side of the case.  During the accident investigation, a weld was noted on the front, right side of the case, and electrical arc marks were noted about 2.3 inches inside the crankshaft bore.  The crankshaft was found to have fractured, and the fracture had originated at the site of the arc marks creating a stress riser in the crankshaft.  As the fracture progressed, it provided an avenue for oil to escape from the crankshaft and propagate through the nose seal.",
            "probable_cause": "The crankshaft's fatigue failure at the site of an electrical arc mark stress riser, during cruise flight.  Contributing factors were the pilot's inadequate preflight inspection, improper decision, and maintenance."

An emergency was declared.  The aircraft landed safely at the intended destination.   Evidence of a water leak was identified by the cabin crew approximately 5 hours from the destination.  Efforts to control the leak were effective, however it was not completely stopped.  Water was reported coming from the upper deck and flowing through the main deck ceiling.  The flight was subsequently directed by air traffic control to make an enroute course change.  However, when this command was entered in the Flight Management Computer (FMC) the aircraft began a shallow left turn instead of a right turn as required.  Initial attempts to disconnect the autopilot were not successful and the autopilot was manually overridden.  The relief first officer at the controls stated the controls \"felt unusual\" and \"stiff.\"  The captain reported elevator and rudder were normal, but bank angle was limited.  The landing was accomplished smoothly and safely according to the captain, and the aircraft was taxied to the gate without incident.  After landing, the captain noted the controls felt normal.  Ramp personnel reported a significant amount of water draining from the fuselage and the drain masts at the gate. A post-incident examination of the aircraft revealed that areas of the main deck carpeting was saturated.  The canted pressure deck overboard drains were not obstructed.  A 6-inch long by 0.125-inch wide gap was located along the outboard edge of the canted pressure bulkhead on the right side of the aircraft.  The seam was not sealed as required.  Immediately aft of the canted pressure bulkhead were aileron and flight spoiler control cables.  Four (4) circuit breakers common to the external drain line heaters were found open.  The external drain lines route wastewater from the cabin overboard.  The breakers were pulled in conjunction with routine cleaning of the drain lines prior to departure.  Ground functional testing of the aileron controls, the aileron trim and the autopilot did not find any anomalies.  A flight test was completed to verify in-flight operation of the flight controls and potable water system.  No anomalies were noted.  Airline procedures related to the routine inspection and cleaning of the external drains were reviewed.  Resetting of the drain heater circuit breakers was the last item.  A service bulletin had been issued which recommended testing, cleaning and inspection of the canted pressure deck drainage system (overboard drains), general visual inspection of the deck structure a pressurization test.  Service bulletin instructions included a visual inspection for loose, missing or cracked sealant.  The airline was in the process of incorporating the service bulletin into its maintenance program.  As a result, the initial service bulletin procedures had not been completed prior to the incident.  An airworthiness directive (AD) which required cleaning of \"the cavity aft of the wing center section\" and verification that all drains were open and clean was in effect at the time of the incident and had been complied with.

The impact appeared to be just less than a 45 degree angle, nose first.\"  A performance study revealed that while the airplane was on downwind, the airplane started to bank to the left.  The bank angle indicated a constant left bank angle of about 24 degrees as the airplane turned to base leg.  Twenty-three seconds later, the bank angle began to increase further as the airplane turned to final approach, overshooting the runway, while the angle of attack reached stall angle of about 17 degrees.  The flight path angle then showed a decrease by 22 to 25 degrees, the calibrated airspeed showed a decrease by 40 to 70 knots, and the vertical speed indicated a 3,000 feet per minute descent rate just before impact.  Examination of the airframe revealed the flaps were in the 20 degree position, and the landing gear was retracted.  According to the airplane flight manual, during the base leg, the flaps should remain in the 5 degree position and the landing gear extended; and when landing is assured, the flaps then extended to 20 degrees and maintain 125 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) during final and 110 KCAS when over the runway.

The helicopter was on the ground with its engines at operational power, when a mechanical malfunction occurred. The pilot was unable to maintain roll control, and the helicopter initiated an uncommanded slow rollover onto its side. The helicopter was operated and maintained by its owner pursuant to a specific maintenance program. A component of this program involved examining each main rotor servo mount pin for rust and corrosion, and performance of dimensional checks prior to reinstallation of the inspected components. The company mechanic reported that he completed the inspection and found no faults.  The records reflect that the components were reassembled and installed on the helicopter that was then returned to service. The accident occurred about 8 operational hours and 2 days following the reported maintenance inspection. During the accident investigation, components that secured one of the three main rotor blade pitch change servo units to the helicopter were found a few yards away from the main wreckage. The components consisted of a nut, bolt, pin, and plate. The components had secured one of the servo units to the helicopter transmission on one end and the helicopter swash plate on the other end. Separation of these components from the helicopter resulted in separation of the servo unit, and consequently resulted in a loss of main rotor blade pitch control. Upon the subsequent visual examination of components, evidence of severe wear and corrosion was detected inside of the nut holding down the retainer mounting strap, which indicates that this area had not been inspected for some time.

Prior to takeoff, the pilot reported that the fuel tanks were full and that he took off with the fuel selector on the right fuel tank. About 1/2 hour into the flight he reported to air traffic control that he was at 10,600 feet and had an anomaly with the airplane. The controller reported that over the next hour, the pilot could not determine the nature of the emergency. According to the controller, with each successive pilot transmission, the pilot's voice was sounding more uneven and his speech rate was slowly deteriorating. Thereafter, the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Radar track data of the airplane's flight revealed various circles and a zigzag-like pattern leading up to the area of the crash site. A witness who saw the airplane land stated that the airplane fully stalled just above a wheat field. The airplane struck the ground extremely hard and nosed over. When the witness arrived on scene the pilot was unconscious. The witness also noted that he did not notice any gas leaking from the wings nor did he smell gas. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the fuel selector valve was on the right tank and the right fuel tank was empty. Very little damage was noted to the propeller. The pilot reported that he has no recollection of any of the events leading up to the accident after the initial position report.",

He touched down at 80 knots with 30 degrees flaps, about 150 feet beyond the runway threshold.  After the aircraft bounced several times, he added 'some' power to stabilize the oscillations.  Now nearing the departure end of the runway, he became concerned that he would not be able to stop.  He applied power to abort the landing and raised his flaps to 20 degrees.  During the abort, the aircraft stuck a car that was traveling along the airport boundary. After striking the vehicle, the elevator controls became jammed.  The pilot reduced power and made a forced landing.  A witness estimated winds as from the east at 10 knots gusting to 15.

Prior to takeoff the pilot received a computerized weather briefing that showed generally good conditions.  The tower controller cleared the pilot to taxi to the active runway (runway 21) and issued winds, which were 300 degrees at 10 knots, a direct crosswind.  During the initial climb after liftoff, the pilot saw that the airplane had stopped climbing and he asked for and received the wind information again.  With the airplane not climbing and headed directly for some trees, the pilot maneuvered the airplane towards a clearing but the left wing hit a tree and the airplane descended into the ground.  The pilot reported no mechanical problems with the airframe and engines.  The density altitude was calculated to be 9,481 feet.  The aircraft's gross weight at the time of takeoff was 6,000 pounds.  Review of the Airplane Flight Manual climb performance charts for that aircraft weight at the pressure altitude and reported outside air temperature discloses that the airplane should have had a positive rate of climb of about 1,100 feet per minute.  The airport was equipped with a wind information recording system, which had four sensors.  Three sensors recorded wind information at ground level only.  They were placed, one each, at the approach, middle, and departure ends of the runway.  Wind data was recorded every 10 seconds.  The system does not have the capability to predict or warn of wind shear events.  During the aircraft's departure, the approach end sensor recorded winds at 068 degrees at 1 knot; the middle sensor recorded winds at 293 degrees at 5 knots; and the departure sensor recorded winds at 302 degrees at 2 knots.  At the next data sampling (10 seconds later), the departure end sensor recorded a wind increase of 10 knots, and the approach end recorded a wind shift from a headwind to a tailwind at 10 knots.

The two pilots and two mission specialists aboard the Sabreliner were fatally injured. The pilot of the Cessna, the sole occupant of the airplane, was fatally injured. The Sabreliner was being operated as a public use flight by the U.S. Department of Defense in support of the U.S. Navy. The Sabreliner was registered to BAE Systems Technology Solutions & Services, Inc. The Cessna was registered to Plus One Flyers, Inc., of San Diego, California, and operated by the pilot as a personal flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Both airplanes were destroyed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at SDM. Both airplanes departed SDM earlier that day and a mission flight plan was on file for the Sabreliner; no flight plan was filed for the Cessna 172. A controller in the SDM air traffic control tower (ATCT) was in contact with both accident airplanes prior to the collision.Witnesses observed the accident airplanes on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern at SDM. The witnesses turned momentarily, but then observed an explosion followed by sections of the airplanes falling to the ground. Another witness located about 2 miles east-northeast of SDM observed both airplanes at the same altitude, flying towards each other. The smaller airplane was flying from the airport, and the larger airplane was flying to the airport and descending. He stated that both airplanes did not appear to have made any avoidance actions prior to the collision. After the collision, the smaller airplane broke apart; the larger airplane banked left, impacted the ground and exploded. The accident site consisted of two debris fields. The Cessna's debris field was located about 400 feet northeast of the Sabreliner's debris field. The Cessna's debris field was about 1,200 feet in length on a magnetic heading of 055 degrees, and contained parts from the Sabreliner. The Cessna was highly fragmented throughout the debris field. The Sabreliner's right wing was found in the Cessna's debris field. The Sabreliner's debris field was contained within a radius of about 100 feet, and no Cessna parts were located within that radius. The Sabreliner came to rest at a magnetic heading of 060 degrees. The wreckage of both airplanes was recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

During his last takeoff at 93 percent power, while at an altitude of about 500 to 700 feet AGL, the turbine started to spool down to about 61 percent (flight idle). He said he initiated emergency procedures to include pushing the left throttle full forward, with no increase in power being realized. He said he then brought the left throttle to flight idle, feathered the propeller, flipped and activated the isolate switch to the on position to bypass the normal fuel delivery system, and then advanced the right throttle full forward. He said the lock clip detent was secure, but this produced no increase in power or thrust, Thrust remained at about 61 percent, with no change being noted in fuel power through either the normal and emergency isolate positions  in fuel flow to the turbine.

After recovery from the water, postcrash examinations of the airframe, engine, and accessories were performed by the manufacturer, and the examinations revealed the presence of \"slime\" in the common airframe fuel filter which received fuel from the normal fuel supply line, as well as the separate emergency fuel supply line that bypassed the fuel control unit, to directly feed the turbine.

The pilot reduced engine power, verified the airplane\u2019s flight controls were still operational, and declared an emergency with the air traffic controller that he was in contact with. As the vibration continued, the pilot elected to shut down the engine and, as the propeller was windmilling, the vibration continued.

As soon as the propeller stopped windmilling, the vibration ceased. The pilot landed the airplane without incident and it was towed to the fixed base operator. A postincident engine teardown revealed that there were no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Examination of a fracture surface on one of the propeller blades revealed that the blade tip failed as a result of fatigue cracking that initiated at the leading edge of the blade.

He selected a forced landing site and entered autorotation as the engine \"sputtered\" and stopped producing power.  The helicopter touched down on an upslope with forward motion, then rolled over on to its side.   A split engine oil suppy line was identified at the site, and examination revealed that beneath the torn fire sleeve and damaged outer braiding material, there was longitudinal cracking about 1 inch in length due to fatigue.  Positioning of the oil line on the accident helicopter was different than a factory-assembled version that was examined, but because the helicopter was amateur built, there was no standard.

He had received several hours of flight training and completed a flight review in the airplane the day before the accident. The accident flight was uneventful until about 20 miles from the destination, at which point the engine began to run rough. The pilot determined that the choke had \"worked its way back about 3/4 of an inch.\" He \"eased\" the choke off and the engine roughness stopped. The engine lost complete power about 5 miles from the destination as the pilot entered the downwind leg for landing on runway 16. The pilot reported that he attempted to glide to the airport; however, the sink rate was excessive and he located a small clearing in the boulders on the bluff ahead and elected \"to stall in vertically rather than to tumble over the rocks horizontally.\" He intentionally stalled the airplane at an altitude of 10 feet above ground. The airplane impacted the terrain, nosed over and came to rest inverted.

He thought that the rpm drop was less than the drop before the engine was overhauled, yet he chose to make the flight. After takeoff, the pilot climbed the airplane to about 3,000 ft mean sea level, where he determined that the optional carburetor temperature gauge was inoperative. He subsequently applied carburetor heat in 5-minute intervals when he changed tanks, which he did twice at 20-minute intervals. \u000b\u000bNoting precipitation in the area, the pilot decided to cut the flight short and return to the departure airport. He applied full carburetor heat before descending the airplane using the descent procedures checklist. About 9 nautical miles (nm) from the runway, with carburetor heat applied and the fuel tanks set to \u201cboth,\u201d he continued a slow descent with 10-degrees flaps. About 6 nm from the runway, the pilot felt a \u201cpower drop.\u201d The engine was still running, but the airplane was descending faster than anticipated. The pilot applied more throttle and felt a \u201cslight boost,\u201d but the airplane continued to descend and subsequently impacted trees. During the descent, the pilot repeatedly checked the controls, \u201cpulling them in and out to make sure they were not stuck,\u201d including the carburetor heat, throttle, prop pitch (fully in), and fuel mixture (full-rich). \u000b\u000bNo evidence of any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation was found. Although the pilot subsequently noted that he was concerned that a preexisting crimp in the scat tube leading from the heat manifold to the carburetor might have caused the engine to lose power, this scenario was unlikely due to the relative size of the crimp and the fact that the pilot did not note any engine anomalies when he applied carburetor heat during cruise flight with higher air flow requirements.\u000b\u000bThe temperature and dew point at the time of the accident were conducive to the accumulation of serious carburetor icing at glide power, and the make and model of airplane is known to be more susceptible than most airplanes to carburetor ice formation. In addition, although the pilot reported adding carburetor heat before initiating a long descent, he did not report\u00a0adding engine power periodically to warm the engine during that descent; thus, it is likely that the carburetor heat manifold cooled to a point where the air being supplied to the carburetor was insufficiently heated to protect it from icing. \u000b\u000bA review of Federal Aviation Administration, manufacturer, and advocacy group carburetor icing publications revealed disjointed and incomplete information. The lack of comprehensive, easily accessible carburetor icing information in a single location likely affects the overall pilot community\u2019s understanding of the subject and could have affected the pilot in particular. \u000b",

He overflew the airport and observed the tetrahedron and windsock, which indicated that the wind was about 13 knots straight down runway 21. He said that he erroneously concluded that the wind was lighter than it was and decided to land on runway 03, which was the only runway he had utilized during the day. The instructor had briefed him that the winds could reverse from morning to afternoon. He said that he turned base too short, and was very high. With the tailwind, he began to run out of runway. He slipped once, and then brought the glider to level. He was about 50 feet above ground level (agl) at the midpoint of the runway. He slipped hard again, and noted as he came out of the slip that he had turned the glider to the right. He flew between a hangar and a clubhouse, and the left wing tore a gash in a trailer with a glider in it. The left wing and tail sustained substantial damage. The pilot sustained cuts on both hands, abrasions on his right leg, and whiplash to his neck.",

The private pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which departed Rutherford County Airport Marchman Field (FQD), Rutherfordton, North Carolina, about 1015. The personal flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The pilot stated that he departed 56NC for a pleasure flight, and stopped at FQD for fuel before returning to 56NC. He initially reported to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that, while landing on the private, 1,500-foot long turf runway, he landed hard and subsequently experienced a loss of directional control. The airplane ground looped and came to rest inverted, resulting in substantial damage to the left wing. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right main landing gear wheel had separated upon touchdown. Examination of the four bolts that secured the wheel assembly to the gear leg revealed elongation of the bolts and stripping and rounding of the threads. The bolts were retained and sent to the NTSB materials laboratory for examination. The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land. His most recent FAA third class medical certificate was issued in August 2013. He reported 254 total hours of flight experience, of which 39 hours were in the accident airplane make and model. The amateur-built, tailwheel-equipped airplane was manufactured in May 2006, and was powered by a Continental IO-240, 125 hp reciprocating engine.

While diverting to Springdale, the pilot informed his passengers that the aircraft was going to 'run out of gas.' Approximately 2.5 miles north of the Springdale Airport, the engine lost power.  A forced landing was initiated, and during the landing roll, the aircraft went through a barbed wire fence and the right wing struck a tree.  The amount of fuel onboard the aircraft prior to departing Malvern was undetermined. Examination of the aircraft by the FAA inspector revealed no evidence of usable fuel in the fuel tanks.  Repeated attempts to obtain a completed Pilot/Operator Report, NTSB Form 6120.1/2, were unsuccessful. ",

The glider lifted off before the tow airplane and then ascended to between 20 and 50 feet above the ground very quickly, and at a \"high\" angle of attack. The glider then yawed to the left and the left wing dropped before it began a slow roll to the right. The glider continued to roll right until it reached an attitude where the wings were perpendicular to the ground. It then sank down until the right wing impacted the ground. The glider \"cart wheeled\" onto its nose before coming to rest inverted. Examination of the glider revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomalies, and that the tow rope disconnected at the glider end at some point during the accident sequence. Toxicological testing of the pilot revealed the presence of a prescription antidepressant. The extent to which the drug may have affected the pilot, if at all, could not be determined.",

The pilot requested assistance from the certified flight instructor (CFI) who directed a go-around. After the pilot began the go-around procedures, the CFI took control of the airplane and reduced the flap setting. The airplane was flown in ground effect as the airplane drifted to the left of the runway. The airplane was not at a safe flying airspeed to maneuver away from a gazebo and windsock. The airplane's left wing collided with the gazebo and the right wing collided with the windsock. The CFI performed a forced landing and the airplane skidded to a stop. The airframe sustained substantial crushing damage to both wings and the forward fuselage, including the firewall. A postaccident examination of the engine and airframe did not reveal any anomalies that would have prevented normal operation.",

Prior to departure, he purchased 100 gallons of  fuel but did not obtain a weather briefing or file a flight plan.  While en route, as day turned into night, the pilot, who was receiving flight following services from air traffic control (ATC), announced to ATC that he needed to divert to another airport that was 40 miles south of his position for fuel.  He also stated that he needed to descend to a lower altitude.  A review of ATC and weather radar data revealed that as the airplane proceeded toward this airport, he flew  through an area of light to moderate rain activity.  Radar data revealed that the airplane unexpectedly initiated a left turn toward  the east-northeast  and disappeared from radar.  According to the last 60 seconds of radar data, the airplane made several climbs and descents and the ground speed decelerated from 173 knots to 113 knots before the data ended.  The airplane came to rest in a heavily wooded terrain on a heading of 331 degrees, approximately 2 miles northwest of the last radar return and approximately 16 miles southeast of another airport that offered fuel services.  The airplane impacted terrain in a near vertical descent, and the entire engine assembly, including two propeller blades, were imbedded about 8-10 feet into the ground.  There was no evidence of a fuel spill at the accident site.  The airplane was reported to have a fuel endurance range of 2.5 hours.

As the pilot made an approach for a water drop, witnesses said the engine made a \"high-pitch whine,\" there was \"a loud pop,\" they saw the rotor blades \"slowing down,\" and heard the blades making a \"thump, thump, thump\" sound. The pilot was heard to say he was \"going down.\" Witnesses reported seeing purple or blue flames shooting 2 to 3 feet from the exhaust stack. After the helicopter struck the ground and rolled over, witnesses heard the engine spooling down and saw flames coming from the engine \"like a blowtorch.\" A post-impact ground fire, confined to the cockpit area, was quickly extinguished. An examination of the helicopter engine revealed evidence of heat distress aft of the labyrinth seal. The turbine section had a \"corn cob\" appearance. The first and second stage nozzles showed heat damage. The third stage nozzle was totally destroyed. According to the engine manufacturer, the turbine blades were exposed to \"around 1,000 degrees C., about 400 degrees C. beyond the normal operating temperature over a short period of time.\" According to \"Helicopter Aerodynamics,\" if the rate of descent exceeds 1/4 of the hover induced velocity, the flow conditions are such that the air is going both up and down through and around the rotor in a disorganized and unsteady manner. This is called vortex ring state. It exists until the helicopter is descending at about twice the hover-induced velocity. In the vortex ring state, the helicopter pilot may find himself in the unusual situation where pulling up the collective pitch does not slow the rate of descent. This is known as settling with power. The pilot has entered \"a flight condition where the required power is more than the available power.\" According to the Artouste IIIB Training Manual, engine rotation (nominal) speed is 33,500 rpm, plus or minus 200 rpm. The fuel control unit maintains this speed. If a load is placed on the engine, the fuel-metering valve opens, fuel flow increases, and engine torque increases. Variation from this speed must not exceed 1,000 rpm. The time it takes to return from a speed variation to the nominal engine rotation speed is less than 4 seconds.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's abrupt collective input during water application to a forest fire. Contributing factors were encountering a vortex ring state, the inadvertent settling with power, the low altitude, and the mountainous terrain."
