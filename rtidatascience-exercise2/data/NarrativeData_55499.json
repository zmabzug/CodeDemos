The flight made two intermediate stops during the trip due to adverse weather, and, each time, witnesses reported observing the accident pilot having difficulty controlling the airplane at low speed and while landing. The other airplanes landed without incident. When one of the other pilots in the group asked the accident pilot about his difficulty during the previous two landings, the accident pilot stated that he was having difficulty controlling the airplane with a passenger onboard and that the additional weight was \"throwing him off.\" The pilots subsequently took off. The weather conditions at the final destination airport included wind aligned within 20 degrees of the runway heading at 11 knots, gusting to 19 knots. One of the pilots chose to land on the airport's 5,000-foot-long paved runway and did so without incident. The accident pilot and two of the other pilots chose to land on a 2,000-foot-long auxiliary turf runway in use exclusively for the fly-in event. Due to space constraints, pilots were advised to avoid overflying areas with aircraft and personnel, which required a traffic pattern that was closer than customary to the auxiliary runway. The other two pilots landed their airplanes without incident; however, the accident pilot made two aborted approaches. Witnesses reported that, during the two aborted approaches, the airplane appeared to enter an aerodynamic stall as it turned onto the final approach to the runway. During the third and final attempted landing, the airplane appeared to enter a stall while turning from the downwind to the base leg of the traffic pattern and subsequently entered a spin and descended into terrain.The pilot's logbook showed that he had not logged the required number of takeoffs and landings for carrying passengers before departing on the morning of the accident flight. In addition, the pilot had not logged the completion of a flight review in nearly 5 years. Witness observations of the pilot's flying performance on the day of the accident indicate that he also was not proficient in the airplane's operation, particularly with a passenger aboard. The pilot missed several opportunities to avoid or mitigate the outcome of the accident. He could have taken additional recurrent flight training offered to him before and on the day of the accident flight. Additionally, upon recognizing his difficulties with the initial two diversionary landings, the pilot could have chosen to perform some additional practice with a flight instructor who was traveling with the group, or return home, rather than continuing the flight to the more demanding environment of a fly-in event. Further, upon recognizing his difficulties while unsuccessfully attempting to land the airplane twice with the nontraditional, constrained traffic pattern offered by the auxiliary turf runway, the pilot could have chosen to land on the longer, paved runway.",

The feathered propellers indicated that, despite the pilot\u2019s statement that the engine did not have power, the engine likely did have power but no thrust. Followup discussions with the pilot revealed that he had been improperly using the propeller controls as the throttles, with the throttle controls in the full-forward position, during the flight. Additionally, the pilot had pulled both propeller controls to the full-feather position upon touching down on the runway and then abruptly advanced them when he initiated a go-around rather than using the throttle as required. The pilot reported that he had an extensive amount of flight time in another airplane make and model that was configured with the propeller and throttle controls oriented in a position directly opposite their position in the accident airplane. The pilot\u2019s mismanagement of the throttle and propeller controls during the attempted go-around after encountering turbulence resulted in insufficient airspeed and degraded climb performance and a subsequent forced landing and impact with terrain.

During rollout the airplane veered immediately right when the power levers were brought into beta.  The captain corrected with rudder and braking but was unable to maintain directional control.  The aircraft ran off the right side of the runway and collided with a ditch and an embankment. After deplaning, the crew found that the winds were a 60-degree tailwind on runway 12.  The windsock's pivot point on the pole was rusted and would not rotate.  The aircraft with the same landing weight and a 60-degree 10-knot tailwind would require a 1,600-foot landing roll on the 2,350-foot runway without the assistance of both props in beta.

Postaccident examination of the wreckage found that the mast had fractured below the point where it extended from the transmission and just above the mast seal retainer plate. Examination of the fracture surfaces revealed that an area of fatigue extended about 95 degrees around the mast\u2019s circumference. The remaining portions of the fracture were identified as low cycle fatigue and overload. The fracture had multiple origins at corrosion pitting on the threads of the mast. The source of the corrosion could not be determined. Maintenance records indicated that the most recent overhaul of the main rotor mast assembly was completed 1,486 hours before the accident. At that time, a magnaflux inspection was performed on the main rotor mast with no discrepancies noted. The records indicate that, during reassembly, a sealant was applied to the threads for corrosion protection.When the mast is installed on the helicopter, the location where the corrosion and fracture occurred is hidden. To fully inspect the area, the mast assembly must be removed from the helicopter and completely disassembled. A second mast failure on a helicopter of the same make and model series occurred on January 20, 2012, in Brawley, California (WPR12LA096).

The pilot was fatally injured. The aircraft was registered to and operated by Semper Fi Aviation, LLC, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an agricultural application flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was not operated on a flight plan. The flight was originating at the time of the accident.A witness observed the airplane climbing out, slipping \"slightly to the right,\" when the right wing dropped \"sharply.\" The airplane descended and impacted the ground. A postimpact fire ensued.The airplane impacted a grass field about 0.12 nautical miles north of the departure end of runway 30 at 5V8. A ground impact mark was located about 20 feet south of the main wreckage. Linear ground impressions emanated toward the south from the ground impact mark consistent with impact of the wing leading edge. The linear marks were oriented consistent with an approximate 270-degree heading on impact. A postimpact fire consumed a majority of the fuselage, as well as the inboard portion of both wings and horizontal stabilizers.The airplane came to rest on its nose with the fuselage and empennage oriented vertically.  The nose was crushed aft approximately in line with the wing leading edges. The wings were in position relative to the fuselage. The engine remained attached to the airframe via the engine mount, which was deformed. The propeller remained attached to the engine. All control surfaces remained attached to the airframe.The accident airplane was a 1972 Bellanca model 7GCBC airplane, serial number 358-72. The airframe incorporated a single-engine, high wing design configuration, with two-place tandem seating and a conventional (tailwheel) landing gear arrangement. The airplane was powered by a 150-horsepower Lycoming O-320-A2B four cylinder, reciprocating engine. Thrust was provided through a two-bladed, fixed pitch McCauley model 1A175/GMA8040 propeller assembly. Agricultural spray equipment was installed on the accident airplane in October 2014.",

The takeoff roll on the 3,040-foot long asphalt runway seemed long with less than normal power to the flying pilot (left seat).  The aircraft was rotated at 65 knots but settled back to the runway at which time the right seat pilot took control and established a shallow climb rate toward the rising terrain west of the airport.  Both pilots felt that an aborted takeoff would result in an overrun into a grassy area containing vehicles and pedestrians.  The flying pilot (right seat) then banked to avoid a large tree and the aircraft settled into the treetops eventually coming to rest inverted in a bog.  Post-crash examination and test run of the engine revealed that the number one cylinder could develop no more than 25-35 pounds of compression.  Further examination revealed the number one cylinder intake seat had dropped down out of its normally seated position at an angle preventing the valve from seating evenly during the compression stroke.",

Radar data revealed that the airplane approached from the north, and was never stabilized during the approach.  When it was about 7 miles from the airport, its altitude was 1,800 feet mean sea level (msl), at a ground speed of 76 knots.  Approximately two minutes later, when the airplane crossed over the final approach fix, about 4.5 miles north of the airport, it was at an altitude of 2,100 feet msl, at a ground speed of 78 knots.  When it was approximately 2.3 miles north of the airport, it was at an altitude of 900 feet msl, and at a ground speed of 81 knots.

About 15 minutes after takeoff, the crew declared an emergency because the airplane had been struck by lightning and requested to divert to Little Rock, Arkansas. After landing, the airplane was inspected and found to have sustained damage from the lightning strike requiring repairs to the left wing skin and rivets and replacement of the left wingtip and aileron. At the time of the incident, the airplane was being handled by controllers at the Fort Worth Air Traffic Control Center. Significant convective weather was in the area and along the airplane's route, resulting in closures of several routes into and out of the Dallas area. The controllers did not provide specific information on the location of the convective activity along the airplane's route until the crew asked for the information. However, in response to a question, the controllers did advise the crew that there was moderate to heavy precipitation ahead. The crew attempted to identify areas where they could divert to avoid the convective activity, but the controller was unable to approve significant deviations because of other traffic flows in the vicinity. Shortly afterward, the lightning strike occurred. Because of the lightning strike and requests for weather deviations by other aircraft flying through the same area, the center's Traffic Management Unit began rerouting aircraft away from the area and toward other routes less affected by convective weather. When interviewed, traffic management staff noted that this pattern was normal: it was not unusual to wait until pilots refused to fly a route because of weather impact before discontinuing its use.This incident was included as an example in a recommendation letter to the FAA, available at http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/recletters/2012/A-12-018-020.pdf, which recommends improved transmission of real-time lightning data to both controllers and pilots.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight's continued operation through an area containing substantial convective weather activity. Contributing to the accident was the air traffic control/traffic management unit's lack of awareness and recognition of the effect of weather movement on the departure route in use and the flight crew's acceptance of a route and limited weather deviation that was inadequate to maintain a safe distance from the thunderstorms in the area."

Winds aloft, up to 9,000 feet, were from the north between 15 and 29 knots.  The balloon flight manual states that the maximum surface wind speed for takeoff and landing is 15 knots.

Once airborne he stated that the flight will be shorter than usual because of the winds.  In fact the balloon had covered the distance that usually takes 1 hour in about 20 minutes.

Examination of the fractured tail boom and tail rotor segments revealed overload fractures consistent with a hard, vertical landing, near 70 percent main rotor rpm. Even though the pilots were not performing an autorotation, the conditions at touchdown were similar to procedures outlined in the Bell 206 Rotorcraft Flight Manual, which instructed pilots to adjust collective pitch during an autorotation maneuver as required to maintain 90 to 107 percent rpm. It was also recommended that a level touchdown be made prior to passing through 70 percent rotor rpm.

Examination of the turf runway after the accident failed to reveal any skid markings that could be associated with the airplane's ground track.  Local law enforcement surveyed the accident site and determined that the airplane touched down with 1,072 feet of runway remaining.  According to the airplane's operating handbook, at maximum gross weight the airplane required about 600 feet to stop on a paved, level, and dry runway.  The operating handbook did not provide landing performance data for a turf runway.  Local weather observations indicated that the surface wind was from the west-northwest at 9 knots.  The airplane was equipped with a hand brake and dual toe brakes.  The hand brake can also be used as a parking brake in conjunction with a locking ratchet system.

Attempts to restart the engine were to no avail, so the pilot made a forced landing on an access road near the runway. During the landing roll, the right wing struck an approach light T-bar. While the airplane sat on the ground, the pilot tried to start the engine. He was not successful.

The pilot reported that he was \"pulling the airplane up into a right hand turn\" at the end of a spray run when he heard a loud \"bang\" and the engine started to run \"really rough.\"  He executed a forced landing to a field.  The landing gear broke off due to the soft field conditions.  The engine was a 450 horsepower Pratt & Whitney R-985-14B engine.  The engine was overhauled 43 hours prior to the accident.  At overhaul, the engine had accumulated a total time of 7,027.1 hours.  The engine logbook noted that AD 78-0807 was complied with.  AD 78-0807 was effective May 2, 1978 for ultrasonic and visual inspections every 150 hours time in service to detect cracking and \"to prevent cylinder head separation from the barrel.\"  The logbook did not contain specific information on the previous histories of the installed cylinders.  The inspection of the airplane revealed that the number 2 cylinder was broken at the third large cooling vent up from the bottom.  The upper portion on the head assembly had separated from the sleeve.  The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Materials Laboratory report noted that the fracture faces were covered by extensive and heavy combustion products and required extensive cleanings to reveal fracture details.  Examinations of the fracture faces revealed features and topography indicative of a large area of fatigue progression.  The fatigue area was on the aft side of the cylinder, biased toward the exhaust valve.  Fracture face markings indicative of multiple fatigue initiation at the inner diameter threads along a wide arc of approximately 140 degrees.  Progression was radial through the head with complete penetration over and arc of about 60 degrees centered in the fatigue region.

The airplane nosed over abruptly, and the cabin immediately filled with water. The pilot estimated the wind to be from 130 degrees at 10 knots, with peak gusts between 12 to 14 knots. However, a pilot-rated witness who observed the accident from the southeastern shoreline of the lake reported that the wind was strong and gusty out of the northeast at 20 to 25 knots at the time. He thought the accident airplane was on a downwind leg, but it was on final approach. He said that the airplane had a very fast ground speed and touched down slightly nose down in a left-float-low attitude. The nose of the left float dug into the water, the left wing struck the water, and the airplane rapidly nosed over. A postaccident examination revealed no evidence of a mechanical malfunction or failure with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. Based on the pilot-rated witness\u2019s statement and the damage to the airplane and its floats, it is likely that the pilot misjudged the wind conditions and landed with a strong, gusty tailwind.

After the accident, the pilot and three of the passengers were able to egress the airplane by bending that door and sliding through the small opening that they created.

The witnesses stated that the airplane then underwent a short series of attitude excursions, rolled right, and descended steeply into a lagoon. All radio communications between the airplane and the air traffic controllers were normal. Ground-based radar tracking data indicated that the airplane's climb to about 500 feet was normal and that it was airborne for about 40 seconds. Postaccident examination of the airframe, systems, and engines did not reveal any mechanical failures that would have precluded continued normal operation. Damage to both engines\u2019 propeller blades suggested low or moderate power at the time of impact; however, the right propeller blades exhibited less damage than the left. The propeller damage, witness-observed airplane dynamics, and the airplane\u2019s trajectory were consistent with a loss of power in the right engine and a subsequent loss of control due to airspeed decay below the minimum control speed (referred to as VMC). Although required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved Airplane Flight Manual, no evidence of a cockpit placard to designate the single engine operating speeds, including VMC, was found in the wreckage.  The underlying reason for the loss of power in the right engine could not be determined.The airplane's certification basis (Civil Air Regulation [CAR] 3) did not require either a red radial line denoting VMC or a blue radial line denoting the single engine climb speed (VYSE) on the airspeed indicators; no such markings were observed on the airspeed indicators in the wreckage. Those markings were only mandated for airplanes certificated under Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23, which became effective about 3 years after the accident airplane was manufactured. Neither the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) nor the airplane manufacturer mandated or recommended such VMC or VYSE markings on the airspeed indicators of the accident airplane make and model. In addition, a cursory search did not reveal any such retroactive guidance for any twin-engine airplane models certificated under CAR 3. Follow-up communication from the FAA Small Airplane Directorate stated that the FAA has \"not discussed this as a possible retroactive action... Our take from the accident studies is that because of the accident record with light/reciprocating engine twins, the insurance industry has restricted them to a select group of pilot/owners\u2026\" Toxicology testing revealed evidence consistent with previous use of marijuana by the pilot; however, it was not possible to determine when that usage occurred or whether the pilot might have been impaired by its use during the accident flight.",

During a required roll maneuver, as the airplane passed through about 90 to 120 degrees of roll at an estimated speed of 220 to 230 miles per hour, the right wing separated from the airframe, followed almost immediately by the left wing. The amateur built experimental airplane was fitted with an in-flight adjustable pitch trim system, which was a deviation from the original ground-only trim adjustment design.  The trim system, designed by the airplane's builder, allowed the pilot to adjust the pitch trim by moving the horizontal stabilizer in flight.  The in-flight system was composed of a lever attached to the fuselage structure, and its movement was restricted with friction washers between the fuselage and the lever.  Full travel of the lever resulted in one inch of vertical movement of the horizontal stabilizer's leading edge.  The manufacturer of the airframe kit stated that the trim system installed on the accident airplane was not of their design.  They further stated that any movement of the horizontal stabilizer during an abrupt maneuver could produce an extremely high amount of G-forces and possibly exceed the structural design limits of the airplane.

While on the downwind leg for runway 24, the tower controller asked the pilot if he could make a visual approach to runway 15.  The pilot replied that he could accept the visual approach to runway 15, and made a left hand turn towards the runway.  During the final approach to runway 15, the pilot recalled that his approach speed was approximately 90 knots, and he was slowing the airplane for landing.  Suddenly, and without warning, the left wing dropped, and the pilot was unable to control the airplane with aileron inputs.  The airplane descended, and impacted the ground about 900 feet prior to the runway threshold.  The pilot added that the engine was producing power at all times and when the left wing dropped he applied full power.  The pilot subsequently stated on his submission of NTSB Form 6120.1/2, that during the turn to runway 15, he reduced the speed to 90 knots, and performed s-turns to lower his altitude.  Approximately 15 seconds before landing, the airplane encountered a wind shear, \"one wing went down, one wing went up,\" and the ailerons did not seem to respond to inputs.  One wing then struck a tree, and the airplane landed in bushes prior to the runway.  According to an air traffic controller at the airport, the winds were fluctuating, with gusts to 20 knots.

Since the turf runway had a significant slope and was bordered by trees on three sides, landings were conducted in the uphill direction, which was to the southeast. The narrowness of the runway, coupled with the proximity of trees to the runway edges, necessitated that pilots taxi uphill to the southeast end, in order to turn around and exit the runway at the northwest end.
