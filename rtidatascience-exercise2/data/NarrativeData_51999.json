The private-rated passenger seated in the left seat and commercial-rated pilot seated in the right seat were fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to Spatial, Inc., and operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed. The time of departure from Merritt Island Airport has not been determined.A friend of the pilot reported seeing the airplane at the departure airport at 1930; though the time of departure was not determined. The owner seated in the right seat was checking out the left seat occupant who intended on renting the airplane for personal use.The direction of flight after takeoff was not determined. One witness reported to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector-in-charge observing the airplane flying 200 feet above ground, then bank to the east. The nose then pitched down, and during the nose-low descent, the witness reported hearing a popping sound from the engine which became quiet and then popped again.Another witness, reported to the FAA-IIC observing the airplane flying about 300-400 feet above the ground with the aircraft spinning in a nose down attitude. He then lost sight of the airplane.Still another witness reported to the FAA-IIC hearing a swooshing sound and realized it was an aircraft. He noted that the engine was not running and the airplane was a couple hundred feet in the air as he saw it go straight down like from 12 to 6 o'clock. He called 911 to report the accident.The homeowner adjacent to where the airplane crashed reported to NTSB that on the date and time of the accident, he was inside his house in his kitchen. He reported it was still light out, and he heard a loud sound that shook his house. He reported prior to the impact he did not hear an engine sound. It took him about 1 minute to find his phone, and he called 911 at 2036.FAA personnel reported there was no record of any ATC contact, no flight plan, and no contact with Lockheed Martin Automated Flight Service Station, or either Direct User Access Terminal (DUAT) vendor.",

About 300 feet above the ground, the engine suddenly quit. The pilot switched fuel tanks, activated the engine boost pump, and began a turn into the wind.  The engine did not restart.  The pilot selected an open area of marsh for an emergency landing area.  When the airplane touched down, the nose wheel separated from the nose wheel strut, and the airplane nosed down in the soft terrain.  The airplane received damage to the engine, propeller, and the left wing.  A postaccident examination of the engine by a mechanic found corrosion, and blockage of the vent hole of the engine manifold valve housing.  The manifold valve is comprised of a fuel inlet, a diaphragm chamber, and outlet ports for fuel lines to each cylinder.  The spring loaded diaphragm operates a valve in the central bore of the lower chamber of the valve body.  Fuel pressure below the diaphragm opens the valve to allow fuel to flow to each cylinder.  A spring above the diaphragm retains the valve in the closed position, absent any fuel pressure.  The upper chamber of the valve housing, containing the spring, is vented to the atmosphere. ",

It then flew to a point about midway along the trail, where trail maintenance was taking place, and began maneuvering about 50 feet, over 50-foot trees.  It entered a steep turn, there was a loud 'bang', and the helicopter descended almost vertically into the woods. The main wreckage was found upside down, and the tail boom was located about 150 feet away.  There were paint transfer marks where the tail boom had separated, which matched the paint on the end of a main rotor blade.  That blade exhibited downward bending near its inboard end, and upward bending near its outboard end.  The blade's leading edge had impact marks and paint transfer marks from the tail boom.  There was no evidence of in-flight blade failure or separation.  Fuel was found onboard the helicopter, and the engine exhibited scoring marks consistent with a sudden stoppage. The student pilot had 64 hours of flight time, and had been to the kit manufacturer's facility three times for training.  He had been endorsed for hovering flight, flight through translational lift and quickstops, provided he remained within 35 feet of the ground at all times.  He had previously had an accident while hovering the helicopter.  Another builder/pilot, who had flown with the student pilot, stated that his 'ability to maintain proper rotor rpm was a problem.'  An onboard recording of throttle positions revealed that the throttle had been opened to 29 to 32 percent, for the first 4, of the last 5 minutes of flight, consistent with the helicopter transiting the area.  From 56 seconds, until 6 seconds prior to the last recording, the throttle position was approximately 38 to 40 percent, consistent with the use of added power for maneuvering over the trees. Three seconds before the last recording, the throttle had been closed to 7 percent, before it was returned to 38 percent for the last two seconds of the recording. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain proper rotor rpm while maneuvering, which resulted in main rotor blade flapping, and its subsequent impact with the tail boom.  A factor was the pilot's lack of experience in maneuvering flight. "

At the completion of that check, she inadvertently forgot to reposition the right engine fuel selector to the \"ON\" position, but instead left it in \"Cross-Feed.\" Therefore, as the flight progressed with both engines using fuel from the left tank, it ultimately led to the consumption of all usable full in that tank. Therefore, the left engine lost all power during the initial climb after takeoff from a practice short-field landing. When the engine lost power, the student realized the right engine fuel selector was in \"Cross-feed\"and repositioned it to the \"ON\" position, but did not advise the flight instructor that she had done so. The flight instructor, who took control of the airplane after the loss of power, was unable to get the left propeller to fully feather due to the low oil pressure created by the low engine rpm. He therefore decided to attempted to turn back to the airport, but in doing so turned left (into the failed engine), and the airplane therefore began to descend at a rate that made it unlikely that he could safely reach the runway. He therefore landed in a nearby open field, whereupon the airplane encountered rough terrain and experienced a collapse of the left main landing gear. The commercially produced expanded checklist that the student was using did not have an added step in the \"Before-Takeoff\" section calling for a recheck of the fuel valves in the \"ON\" position. The expanded checklist produced by the airplane's operator did have such a step, but the operator did not have a written policy requiring the use of their checklist.",

The private pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was substantially damaged by impact and a post impact fire. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by T & G Flying Club, Inc. The pilot rented the airplane and was flying it on a personal flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight which was not operating on a flight plan. The flight was originating at the time of the accident. The pilot reserved the airplane from T&G; Flying Club, at 2022 using an online reservation system. He reserved the airplane for 4 hours, beginning at 2030. The employees of the flying club had left for the evening by time the pilot and passengers arrived.Two witnesses, stated that shortly after 2100, they saw 4 males walk across the ramp toward the tie-down area near hangar 7. One of the males had a carry-on type suitcase. The pilot and passengers then boarded a Cessna 172. One of the witnesses stated the airplane stayed on the ramp for about 30 minutes with the engine running. They did not see the airplane after this time.At 2146, the pilot called ground control for a takeoff taxi clearance stating he was on the ramp south of the T&G; Flight Club. The controller issued the pilot a clearance to taxi to runway 6 via the Alpha 7 taxiway to the Alpha taxiway. The controller also issued the wind condition as 140 degrees at 8 knots along with the altimeter setting. The pilot stated his radio was a little \"fuzzy\" and he asked the controller to repeat the clearance. The controller repeated the taxi clearance, which the pilot subsequently repeated. About 4 minutes later, the controller informed the pilot that he is taxiing to the wrong runway. After asking the controller to repeat what he said, the pilot stated \"Thank you I'm sorry.\" The controller then issued taxi instructions back to the approach end of runway 6.At 2156, the pilot radioed that he was ready to takeoff on runway 6. The controller asked the pilot what his direction of flight was going to be. The pilot responded that they were going to fly east to sightsee and that they would be back in a little while. The controller issued the takeoff clearance with a right turn after takeoff. At 2158, the pilot radioed that they were not climbing fast and they wanted to immediately make a left turn to turn around. The controller approved the left turn. The controller stated it appeared the airplane began a left turn when it descended to the ground. The controller reported that during the takeoff, the airplane became airborne about 100 feet past taxiway Alpha 6, which was approximately 2,000 feet down the runway.The airplane impacted the ground, a chain link fence, a guy wire, and a telephone pole prior to coming to rest about 1,000 feet on a bearing of 20 degrees from the departure end of runway 6. This location is just north of the intersection of Bishop Road and Curtiss Wright Parkway. The wreckage path was along a 210 degree heading. The left wing tip, including the position light, was embedded in the ground at the first impact mark. This mark was east of the chain link fence. The airplane then traveled through the fence, with the left wing contacting one of the fence posts. The main impact crater was in the west side of the fence. Adjacent to the crater were two slash marks in the soft ground. Both marks were about 12 inches long. One of the slash marks was about 7 inches deep and the other was about 4 inches deep.

The group planned to land at an interim stop before continuing to the fly-in the following day. The accident airplane was the fourth to land. During the approach, the airplane impacted the ground about where a base-to-final approach turn would have been expected. GPS data showed that the airplane entered a descending left turn that reached a turn rate of about 900 degrees per minute and a descent rate of about 1,300 feet per minute before impact. The pilot of the fifth airplane and his passenger commented that the final radio transmissions over the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) from the accident pilot seemed out of the ordinary and that he was fumbling for words. They said that this was not common for the accident pilot and that he was usually very precise in his radio transmissions. The accident pilot\u2019s wife reported that he had complained that he was not feeling well and had chest pain 2 days before the accident flight. Reportedly, he thought the chest pain was from a pulled muscle. The wife reported that the chest pain had resolved and that the pilot was feeling better by the time of the flight but that he had not seen a physician. Autopsy findings revealed that the pilot had left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary artery disease that put him at risk for an acute cardiac event; such an event would leave no evidence visible on autopsy. In addition, the pathologist\u2019s autopsy findings stated, \u201cWhile no acute ischemic changes are found, the interstitial fibrosis is consistent with prior ischemia, and cardiac hypertrophy is associated with arrhythmias\u2026Thus, it appears possible, given the information that decedent\u2019s radio transmissions on the CTAF prior to the accident indicated he was fumbling for words, that he suffered a cardiac arrhythmia prior to the accident.\u201d\u00a0Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

During the approach, the airplane was initially fast as the first officer had increased engine power to compensate for wind conditions. Descending below the minimum descent altitude (MDA), the first officer momentarily deployed the speed brakes, but stowed them about 200 feet above ground level (agl), and reduced the engine power to flight idle. The airplane became low and slow, and developed an excessive sink rate. The airplane subsequently landed hard on runway 22, which drove the right main landing gear into the right wing, resulting in substantial damage to the right wing spar. The first officer reported intermittent airspeed fluctuations between his airspeed indicator and the captain's airspeed indicator; however, a subsequent check of the pitot-static system did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airspeed indicators. About the time of the accident, the recorded wind was from 190 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 24 knots; and the captain believed that the airplane had encountered windshear near the MDA, with the flaps fully extended. Review of air traffic control data revealed that no windshear advisories were contained in the automated terminal information system broadcasts. Although the local controller provided windshear advisories to prior landing aircraft, he did not provide one to the accident aircraft. Review of the airplane flight manual (AFM) revealed that deploying the speed brakes below 500 feet agl, with the flaps in any position other than the retracted position, was prohibited.",

She talked with the pilot about 1000.  The pilot stated he had landed at Norwood, Massachusetts, due to snow and the poor weather conditions and that he had hoped to complete the flight before the weather moved into the area.  At that time, the pilot stated he had called for a rental car and was waiting for it to arrive, so he could drive home.  She next talked to the pilot about 1430, and was informed that he was still waiting for a rental car to arrive.  She stated that the pilot was \"very frustrated;\" and they talked about him possibly renting a room at a local hotel.  The pilot stated he would call her when the rental car arrived.  At approximately 1612, the pilot requested a \"special visual flight rules\" (SVFR) clearance to depart the airport to the southwest.  The controller noted that the ceiling was 400 feet overcast, and observed, \" what appeared to be up to 2 inches of slush and snow on the airplane's wings and control surfaces.\"  The controller denied the SVFR clearance and advised the pilot of the low ceilings and snow/slush contamination he observed on the airplane.  However, the pilot departed, without a clearance and turned southwest.  There were no further known communications with the airplane.  Several residents reported seeing and/or hearing a low-flying airplane to local authorities.  The last visual sighting, and radar contact with the airplane occurred between 1930 and 2000.  The body of the pilot was located in Buzzards Bay, on May 27, 2001, and as of May 8, 2002, the airplane had not been located.  The pilot was instrument rated and reported 15,000 hours of total flight experience on his most recent FAA second class medical certificate.

            "narrative": "On June 25, 2015, about 1215 Alaska daylight time, a single-engine, turbine-powered, float-equipped de Havilland DHC-3 (Otter) airplane, N270PA, sustained substantial damage when it impacted mountainous tree-covered terrain, about 24 miles northeast of Ketchikan, Alaska. The airplane was being operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135, as an on-demand visual flight rules (VFR) sightseeing flight when the accident occurred. The airplane was owned by Pantechnicon Aviation, of Minden, Nevada, and operated by Promech Air, Inc., of Ketchikan. The commercial pilot and eight passengers were fatally injured. Marginal visual meteorological conditions were reported in the area at the time of the accident. The flight departed a floating dock located in Rudyerd Bay about 44 miles northeast of Ketchikan about 1200 for a tour through Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness. A company VFR flight plan was in effect. At the time of the accident, the flight was returning to the operator's base at the Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base, Ketchikan. The flight was a sightseeing flight for passengers of a cruise ship that was docked in Ketchikan. The tour, named Cruise/Fly, consisted of two groups of passengers. One group departed Ketchikan onboard a marine vessel and the other group departed via airplane, with a predetermined rendezvous at the floating dock in Rudyerd Bay. Once at the floating dock, the two groups would switch transportation modes for the return trip to Ketchikan. The operator reported that the accident airplane departed Rudyerd Bay as the third of four float-equipped airplanes on air tour flights over the Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness. The airplanes departed about 5 minutes apart, and the standard route of flight was southwest, over an area of remote inland fjords, coastal waterways, and mountainous tree-covered terrain.  When the airplane failed to return to Ketchikan, the operator initiated a search for the missing airplane and heard an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal along the accident pilot's anticipated route of flight. A helicopter from Temsco Helicopters, Inc., of Ketchikan, was dispatched to the suspected accident site to search for the missing airplane. However, the helicopter pilot said that he was unable to search the upper levels of the mountainous areas due to low ceilings and poor visibility. The helicopter pilot said that, after waiting for the weather conditions to improve, he was able to search the upper elevations of the search area and located the wreckage about 1429. The Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad (KVRS) team members reached the accident site and confirmed that the airplane's occupants had sustained fatal injuries. The NTSB investigator-in-charge along with another NTSB investigator, with help from KVRS, reached the accident site on the morning of June 27. The airplane impacted trees and a near vertical rock face in a nose high, wings level attitude at an elevation of about 1,600 feet mean sea level and came to rest upright on top of its separated floats, in an area of heavily forested, steep terrain.  The accident airplane was equipped with an avionics package known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), which is also known as \"Capstone.\" ADS-B technology provides pilots with situational awareness by displaying the airplane's position over terrain, while using GPS technology, coupled with an instrument panel mounted, moving map display. The ADS-B equipment installed in the accident airplane included two Chelton multifunction display (MFD) units. One MFD provides the pilot with a moving map with terrain awareness information, and the other provides primary flight display information. The two MFD units were removed from the wreckage and shipped, to the NTSB vehicle recorder laboratory, Washington, D.C.  The accident airplane was equipped with a Pratt & Whitney PT6A-135A engine that produces 750 shaft horsepower. A comprehensive NTSB postaccident examination of the engine and airframe is pending, after the airplane wreckage is recovered to Ketchikan.  The closest weather reporting facility is Ketchikan Airport (KTN), Ketchikan, AK, about 24 miles southwest of the accident site. At 1153, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) at KTN reported in part: wind 130 degrees at 15 knots, gust 23 knots; visibility 6 statute miles, rain and mist, runway 11 visual range 4,000 variable to greater than 6,000 feet; few clouds 800 feet, broken clouds 1,200 feet, overcast clouds 2,700 feet; 61 degrees F; dew point 57 degrees F; altimeter 29.91 in Hg.

Witnesses said that the pilot had transmitted on Common Traffic Advisor Frequency the intention of practicing a loss of engine power after takeoff, and turning 180 degrees to return to the airport.  Another witness said that the airplane pitched up 30 degrees while simultaneously banking hard to the right in an uncoordinated manner.  He said that as the airplane rolled to the right, the nose of the airplane yawed down to nearly 45 degrees below the horizon.  Subsequently, the airplane's wings rolled level, but the aircraft was still pitched nose down.  He said the airplane appeared to be recovering from its dive.  A witness said that the airplane appeared to be in a landing flare when he observed dirt and grass flying up behind the aircraft.  He said the airplane's right wing tip and engine impacted terrain, and a fire ensued that consumed the airplane.  Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane's right wingtip hit a 10 inch in diameter rock and immediately impacted a wire fence 10 inches above the ground.  Approximately 120 feet of triple wire fence continued with the airplane to the point of rest.

The pilot diverted to an airport that had an ILS approach during the flight because of deteriorated weather.  The pilot stated that during the approach the airplane did not seem to be descending so he disconnected the autopilot and subsequently executed a missed approach.  The pilot reported that upon reaching 2,600 feet msl during the missed approach, he leaned the engine using turbo inlet temperature.  The pilot reported the engine began to sputter so he pushed the mixture to rich, adjusted the throttle, and switched the boost pump to LOW, but the engine continued to sputter.  He switched the boost pump to HI and the sputtering stopped momentarily before starting again.  The pilot informed ATC that he was having a fuel problem and he needed to land \"ASAP.\"  The approach controller issued a vector to turn N8018J onto the approach.  The pilot stated he switched the fuel selector to the left tank position and he attempted to restart the engine to no avail.  The pilot reported that during the emergency descent all of the airplane lights went out except for the GPS and EFIS which had independent lighting systems.  The airplane impacted the utility pole and slid across a county road before coming to rest.  A post impact fire and explosion ensued.  Usable fuel capacity for the airplane is 102 gallons.  The fuel tanks were last topped off on August 1, 2003, and there was an addition total of 151.7 gallons added since that time.  This resulted in the airplane having had 253.7 gallons of usable fuel on board since August 1, 2003.  The airplane was flown 12.1 hours with 8 takeoffs since it was topped off.   The pilot stated the fuel burn ranged from 12 to 30 gallons per hour with an average of 18 to 19 gallons per hour.   According to Beechcraft, an additional 4 gallons of fuel would be used for each taxi, takeoff, and climb sequence.   A fuel burn of 18 gallons per hour, would have resulted in the airplane using 249.8 gallons (217.8 gallons plus 32 gallons)  of fuel during the 12.1 hours of flight time.  A fuel burn of 19 gallons per hour would have resulted in 261.9 gallons (229.9 gallons plus 32 gallons) being used.  Inspection of the engine revealed only residual fuel was present in the fuel manifold and in the fuel metering unit.  There was no fuel present in any of the fuel lines or in the fuel pump.  Regulation 49 CFR Part 91.167 states no person may operate a civil aircraft in IFR conditions unless it carries enough fuel to complete the flight to the first airport of intended landing, fly from that airport to the alternate airport, and fly thereafter for 45 minutes at normal cruise.

            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inaccurate preflight planning which resulted in an inadequate fuel supply and subsequent fuel exhaustion.

The airplane was being operated by Hageland Aviation Services, Inc., dba RAVN Connect, Anchorage, Alaska as a visual flight rules (VFR) training flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The two crew members on board were fatally injured. Day, visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed, and company flight following procedures were in effect. The local training flight departed from the Bethel Airport, Bethel, Alaska at 1522.About 1745, personnel from Hageland Aviation in Bethel notified the Hageland Operational Control Center (OCC) in Palmer, Alaska that the accident airplane was overdue. At 1754, the OCC initiated a call to the Kenai Flight Service to initiate search and rescue operations. A company airplane was dispatched from Bethel to assist in the search, and at 1839 that airplane visually confirmed that the accident airplane had crashed. The Alaska State Troopers in Bethel, assisted by the Alaska Army National Guard arrived at the accident scene at 2105, and confirmed that both pilots had died at the scene. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), an inspector from the Anchorage Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), an investigator from Textron Aviation, and a representative of the operator traveled to the accident scene on the morning of April 10.The main wreckage was in an area of level, heavily wooded terrain situated along a river, at an elevation of approximately 75 feet mean sea level (msl). From the initial point of impact, the airplane traveled approximately 180 feet before coming to rest in an upright position. The majority of the fuselage was consumed by a post impact fire. An on-scene documentation of the wreckage was completed, and a detailed wreckage examination is pending, following recovery of the airplane.The accident airplane was not equipped, nor was it required to be equipped with, a cockpit voice recorder (CVR), or a flight data recorder (FDR). The accident airplane was equipped with automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) technology. In typical applications, the ADS-B capable aircraft uses an ordinary Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to derive its precise position from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellation, and then combines that position with any number of aircraft parameters, such as speed, heading, altitude and flight number. This information is then simultaneously broadcast to other ADS-B capable aircraft, and to ADS-B ground, or satellite communications transceivers, which then relay the aircraft's position and additional information to Air Traffic Control centers in real time. A preliminary review of ADS-B data archived by the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) showed that the accident airplane was transmitting data for the accident flight, and the airplane was flying at an altitude of approximately 3,400 feet mean seal level (msl) when a fluctuation in altitude, followed by an initial upset occurred. The airplane continued a rapid and steep descent until ground impact. A detailed NTSB analysis of the ADS-B data is pending.The nearest official reporting station is the Bethel Airport (PABE), about 27 miles northeast of the accident site. About 3 minutes before the accident, at 1553, an Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) was reporting: Wind, 020 degrees (True) at 8 knots; visibility, 10 statute miles; sky condition, clear; temperature, 19 degrees F; dew point, 3 degrees F; altimeter, 28.87 inches Hg.",

The pilot then performed a \"wheel landing\" to runway 10, a 4,300-foot-long, 75-foot-wide asphalt runway. However, by touchdown, the wind speed and direction had changed, which raised the left wing. The pilot corrected for the lifting of the wing, but the heading of the airplane diverged 10 to 15 degrees to the left of runway heading. At that point, the pilot elected to continue into the snow-covered apron, rather than struggle to maintain runway alignment, and risk the loss of aircraft control. The airplane's main landing gear \"caught\" as it entered the snow, the airplane nosed over, and came to rest inverted with substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer.

The pilot, who was the sole occupant, was fatally injured and the airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to Deadalus Air LLC, and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a business flight. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed en route. The flight departed the Cavern City Air Terminal (CNM), Carlsbad, New Mexico and was en route to LBB. According to the air traffic control recording, the pilot was executing the RNAV Y instrument approach to runway 35L. The controller vectored the airplane off of the first approach for re-sequencing. While the airplane was being vectored for a second approach, contact with the pilot was lost and the airplane was no longer visible on the radar display. Attempts to contact the pilot were unsuccessful. According to a witness who was in the parking lot next to the TV tower, he heard the accident airplane overhead and it sounded like the airplane's engine was operating. He looked up and saw a large flash of light that filled his field of view. He observed the TV tower's red beacon lights turn off and then the tower collapsed on top of itself. He described the weather as cold, very low clouds and no precipitation. According to surveillance video which was recorded 1.6 miles northeast of the accident site, the airplane was observed in a 30\u00b0 nose low descent near the tower.

The pilot used landing gear braking and reverse thrust to control the airplane, but it still continued to veer left and then off the runway. The airplane struck the airport perimeter fence and a tree and came to rest. Postaccident examinations and tests of the nosewheel steering system and its associated components revealed that the steering actuator did move uncommanded at varying rates and directions when electrical power was off and hydraulics were engaged to the nosewheel steering system. Further, this occurred as a result of the select/bypass valve's failure to seal properly when in an unpowered state due to incorrect shimming within the select/bypass valve, which allowed hydraulic fluid to enter the servo valve when the system was off. The available hydraulic pressure was then ported to move the steering actuator relative to the position of the servo valve spool. Examinations also confirmed that, when the servo valve was electrically powered off, the spool could slightly free-float, and the unpowered spool position could be biased in the direction of the last commanded travel from when the system was last engaged. Examination of the rest of the airplane revealed no other mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.The nose landing gear assembly was overhauled 7 days before the accident.

While in cruise flight, at 2,000 feet, both engines experienced a total loss of power.  The pilot attempted to autorotate to a field; however, the helicopter impacted trees and came to rest on its right side.  The pilot reported that he did not notice any warning lights immediately prior to or during the loss of engine power events.  However, it was noted during a post-accident examination of the helicopter that the pilot instrument light and console light variable resistor control was in the ON position.  This control dims the master caution and annunciator panel lights for night operations.  The NTSB IIC noted that the master caution and annunciator lights were not visible in daylight with the pilot and console variable resistor control in the ON position.  Although the two fuel transfer pump switches were found in the ON (normal operating) position, examination of the fuel system provided evidence that the dual engine power loss was the result of fuel starvation due to these switches not being ON during the majority of the flight.  The fuel supply lines to the engines were found empty, a nominal amount of fuel was found in the fuel filters, and  the fuel quantity indicator displayed 4, 0, and 15 gallons of fuel in the #1 supply, #2 supply, and forward main fuel tanks, respectively.  The function of the fuel transfer pumps is to transfer fuel from the forward main tank to the two supply tanks.  The fuel transfer pumps were operated during the post-accident examination by turning on their respective switches and it was noted that fuel began to flow into the supply tanks.  Additionally, it was noted that the fuel transfer pump caution lights (which are illuminated when the pumps are off) extinguished when the pumps were turned on.

The helicopter was on lease to the local sheriff\u2019s office, and was being flown by the chief pilot of the company that owned it. Two SAR personnel were passengers. After an initial but fruitless search to locate the snowmobile victim, the helicopter located members of the snowmobile party. After a landing and brief discussion with the snowmobilers, they agreed to lead the helicopter to the accident site on their snowmobiles. The helicopter lifted off to follow the snowmobilers, flying about 100 to 200 feet above the trees. Because the helicopter was faster than the snowmobiles, the pilot stopped several times in a hover to allow the snowmobiles to catch up. During one hover, the pilot experienced a slight left yaw, which he believed he corrected. The helicopter then began to spin rapidly and descended into the trees. The sheriff\u2019s office dispatchers used a commercial flight following system to track the helicopter, but system difficulties prevented them from detecting the accident via that system. The injured pilot climbed a nearby hill, and notified the dispatchers of the accident via radio. \u000b\u000bThe recovered wreckage was examined, and no evidence of any preimpact deficiencies or failures that would have prevented normal operation and continued flight was discovered. Data recovered from the engine control unit indicated that the engine operated normally until the accident, when parameter exceedances and torque spikes, consistent with main rotor blade strikes, were recorded. \u000b\u000bThe directional control actuator (DCA), which was the hydro-mechanical unit used to control the tail rotor, was removed and sent to the helicopter manufacturer for testing and examination. The DCA passed the functional checks, and no evidence of any anomalies that would have prevented normal operation was detected. \u000b\u000bA damaged tree near a trail sign in the search area suggested the possibility that the tail rotor might have struck the tree and been damaged just before the accident. However, examination of the damage to the tree and the tail rotor did not support that hypothesis. \u000b\u000bSingle-main-rotor helicopters are susceptible to a phenomenon known as \u201closs of tail rotor effectiveness\u201d (LTE), which can occur at low airspeeds, and is a function of relative wind direction. The loss of control occurred in a hover, but the relative wind direction could not be determined. LTE is more likely at high density altitude and/or gross weight. The accident occurred at a density altitude of about 9,000 feet, and at a weight about 800 pounds below the maximum certificated operating weight. In the accident helicopter, LTE would result in a nose-right spin direction. Both the pilot and surviving passenger recalled that the spin direction was nose left, which is contrary to LTE. However, neither was certain of the spin direction, and a ground witness reported that the spin direction was nose right, consistent with LTE. Examination of the wreckage did not provide conclusive evidence as to the direction of the spin, but did indicate that both the main and tail rotor were rotating under power at the time of impact. Based on the witness observation and the uncertainty of the helicopter occupants about the direction of spin, the high density altitude, and the lack of indications of a tail rotor mechanical failure, it is likely that the loss of control was due to LTE.\u000b",

It went off the runway, crossed the median and parallel taxiway, across the parking ramp, and collided with a hangar \"at a high rate of speed.\"  A sign, a pickup truck parked outside, and an airplane inside the hangar were also damaged.    After the collision, the rear engine continued to run at full power.  The witness drove to the accident site and tried to gain access to the cockpit from outside the airplane in an attempt to shut the engine down.  When this failed, he went inside the hangar, and tried to reach inside the cockpit.  The engine quit running shortly thereafter.  Another witness said he heard the airplane's engines running at \"full throttle\" and saw the airplane \"hopping and fishtailing\" across the ground.  When he arrived at the accident site, the rear propeller was striking a blue-colored pickup truck parked next to the hangar, and oil was \"spraying everywhere.\"  The engine eventually shut down, and the propeller moved to the feathered position.  The airplane was pulled from the hangar and examined.  No discrepancies were noted with the steering and brake systems.

The pilot indicated that during this time no carburetor heat was applied to the engine.  Thereafter, when he commenced taking off, full engine power was not produced.  The airplane climbed between 250 and 300 feet above the runway, descended and impacted trees, and then collided with terrain about 1,500 feet beyond the runway's departure end.  The pilot indicated that the accident could have been prevented had he, before initiating his takeoff and while waiting for landing traffic, applied carburetor heat to the engine.  At the time, the temperature and dew point were 9 and 1 degree Celsius, respectively.  According to a standard reference icing probability chart, the atmospheric conditions were in the range considered favorable for carburetor ice formation.  The pilot reported that no mechanical malfunctions or failures were experienced with the airplane.  The engine was subsequently examined, and no evidence of any internal mechanical malfunction was noted.  The mixture control cable was found improperly rigged.  As a result, when the cockpit mixture control was set to the full rich position, the mixture control arm on the carburetor was between the midrange position and 2/3 of the way to the idle cutoff position.  The significance of the incorrect rigging to the loss of engine power could not be established.",

Sounds consistent with engine operation during the descent were reported by witnesses. The aircraft wreckage was located directly under a designated practice area. The floor of the practice area was 2,500 feet above ground level (agl) and the upper altitude limit was 5,500 feet agl. According to the flight school director of operations, typical work done in the high-altitude working areas included stalls, slow flight, and steep turns. Examination of the airplane wreckage revealed that the flaps were in-between the takeoff and landing position; flap deployment is consistent with slow flight or stall practice. The intention of the instructional flight was to prepare the student for his private pilot practical examination. According to records maintained by the flight school, a majority of the student pilot's flights had been with the accident instructor; however, the certified flight instructor (CFI) provided extremely little documentation on the actual performance of the student during the flight portion of his training. A similar stall and spin event occurred 2 weeks prior to the accident where the same CFI and a different student lost control of the airplane during a slow flight practice; however, in that instance, the CFI was able to recover the airplane quickly. The CFI's most recent spin training was conducted 7 years prior to the accident, although the flight school required instructors to complete a flight check every 12 months for each course of training they were approved to teach.The flight school that operated the training flight did not have a functional mechanism to track safety incidents or a well advertised way for the students or staff to anonymously report aviation safety concerns. The director of safety did not convene regular safety meetings. Flight school management did not require CFIs to create written commentary regarding each student\u2019s performance. There was a perception by three of the four chief flight instructors that CFI proficiency flights were not encouraged, and the CFIs were discouraged from using company flight time to maintain proficiency.",

Because the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) indicated the winds were coming from the southwest, he asked the tower what the current winds were. The tower controller told him the winds were from 240 degrees at approximately six knots, and then asked if he would like to land on runway 22. After the pilot answered affirmatively, he was cleared to land on runway 22. While he was on final, the pilot noticed there was a strong right quartering headwind. In an attempt to compensate for the wind conditions, the pilot elected to keep the right wing low during the landing flare, necessitating an initial touchdown on the right main gear. Although the touchdown in this manner was successful, during the landing roll, when the pilot lowered the left main gear to the runway, the right wing lifted into the air, and the left wing contacted the runway surface. The pilot said he believed the aircraft encountered a wind gust just as he lowered the left wheel to the runway surface, and he further stated that he did not feel there were any problems with the aircraft's flight controls or tailwheel steering systems.

The airplane collided with the top of a large tree and came to rest upside down on the ground. The witness called 911 and the Hall County Sheriff's Department and Fire Department responded to the accident scene. Fire department personnel stated they did not smell or see any fuel around the crash site.  Examination of the airplane by an FAA Inspector showed the left and right main fuel tanks were not breached and did not contain any usable fuel. After recovery of the aircraft from the crash site the engine was operated on the airplane without any evidence of precrash mechanical failure or malfunction. Examination of the airplane fuel system, structure, and flight controls showed no anomalies. Review of the Cessna 182 Owners Manual states on page 1-8, that the left and right main fuel tanks hold 32.5 gallons of fuel of which 27.5 gallons of fuel are useable in all flight conditions. In addition, 3.5 gallons of additional fuel are useable from the left and right main fuel tank in level flight only.

During the rollout, the pilot reduced power by pulling the power levers aft, to the flight idle stop.  He then depressed the latch levers, and pulled the power levers further aft, beyond the flight idle stop, through the beta range, into the reverse range.  During the power reduction, the pilot noticed, and responded to a red beta light indication.  Guidance from both the manufacturer and the operator prohibited the use of reverse thrust on the ground with a red beta light illuminated.  The pilot pushed the power levers forward of the reverse range, and inadvertently continued through the beta range, where aerodynamic braking was optimum.  The power levers continued beyond the flight idle gate into flight idle, a positive thrust setting.  The airplane continued to the departure end of the runway in a skid, and departed the runway and taxiway in a skidding turn.  The airplane dropped over a 60-foot embankment, and came to rest at the bottom.  The computed landing distance for the airplane over a 50-foot obstacle was 3,900 feet, with braking and ground idle (beta) only; no reverse thrust applied.  Ground-taxi testing after the accident revealed that the airplane could reach groundspeeds upwards of 85 knots with the power levers at idle, and the condition levers in the flight position. Simulator testing, based on FDR data, consistently resulted in runway overruns.  Examination of the airplane and component testing revealed no mechanical anomalies.  Review of the beta light indicating system revealed that illumination of the red beta light on the ground was not an emergency situation, but only indicated a switch malfunction.

As the airplane entered the turn, items from the cockpit fell from the airplane. The airplane continued in the left turn until it impacted the ground. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction. The airplane, by design, does not have a cockpit indication for the security of the canopy. Structural documentation of the canopy latching mechanism did not reveal any damage to the latching mechanism, which is indicative of it not being latched when the airplane impacted the ground. Based on post-mortem toxicology results, the pilot had likely recently used two different prescription painkillers that commonly result in impairment, and that may increase risk of seizure, particularly when used together.  Based on his height and weight, poorly controlled blood pressure in spite of the use of at least two different medications to lower it, and the presence on autopsy of right-sided heart enlargement, he likely had obstructive sleep apnea, a condition associated with fatigue and cognitive impairment.  His response to a real or perceived emergency may have been impaired by the medications themselves, by a seizure induced by the medications, or by the effects of possible obstructive sleep apnea.  The pilot did have a single blocked small coronary artery, but the condition had been present and evaluated just over two years prior to the accident, with evidence of good blood flow in spite of the blockage.  It is unlikely that the blockage was related to the accident.  The pilot had not indicated high blood pressure, use of medications to treat high blood pressure, or use of prescription painkillers on his most recent application for airman medical certificate just over 16 months prior to the accident.",

The airline transport pilot and student pilot were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, that departed from Palm Beach County Park Airport (LNA), West Palm Beach, Florida at 1218.Preliminary radar data indicated that the airplane had been operating over a wildlife  refuge area for approximately 25 minutes prior to the accident. According to witnesses who were fishing about a half mile from the accident site, they also observed the airplane flying over the wildlife refuge, and then heard the airplane engine make a sound that resembled a cylinder misfire, similar to what they had heard their boat motor do. The engine then \"revved up\" almost instantaneously, which was followed by a loud boom about thirty seconds later. The witnesses then rushed to the accident site, and observed smoke coming from the wreckage. About a minute later a postcrash fire ensued.Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane had come to rest upright in a swamp on a southeasterly heading about 40 feet from a berm. All major components of the airplane were accounted for. The wings had remained attached to the fuselage and exhibited some fire damage. Both wing flaps and a portion of the left wing aileron were destroyed by fire. A portion of the right wing tip, that measured about 70 inches in length, was impact separated. The fuselage, with the exception of the cockpit hull, and the empennage, were completely destroyed by fire. The elevator had separated from the tail section and was located several feet behind the main wreckage. All three composite propeller blades were fracture separated from the propeller hub. A section of propeller blade that measured about 15 inches in length was co-located with the main wreckage. The other two propeller blades were not recovered. Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that the airplane was not rotating around the vertical axis at impact.Postaccident examination of the airframe was conducted After recovery from the accident site. Continuity of the elevator flex control cable was confirmed from the elevator to the elevator flight controls. Both left and right aileron flex cables were attached to the aileron and displayed continuity to the center bell crank. The wing flap control system was not recovered. The airplane was equipped with three fuel tanks; a left wing tank, a right wing tank, and a fuselage tank. Both wing tanks were destroyed by fire. The fuselage tank remained intact; however, the fuel lines were burned and the fuel vent was impact damaged. The gascolator filter was free of debris and the gascolator bowl was void of contamination. The right and left occupants' rudder pedals moved synchronously, which actuated the center bell crank assembly and push rods. There was approximately six inches of push rod, which extended from the rudder into the vertical stabilizer. The rudder control tubes that connected to the push rod at the vertical stabilizer were not recovered. The throttle and choke controls were confirmed from the throttle/choke quadrant to the carburetors.The pilot held a FAA airline transport pilot license with a rating for airplane multi-engine land. His most recent FAA first-class medical certificate was issued on February 4, 2015. At that time, he reported 19,400 hours of total flight experience of; of which, about 149 hours were in the airplane make and model.A handheld Garmin 496 global positioning system receiver was recovered from the cockpit and forwarded to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory, Washington, DC, for download.",

Auxiliary lighting had recently been installed in the glareshield.  This did not provide adequate lighting, so the pilot clipped two flashlights onto the glareshield, used two additional handheld flashlights to illuminate the instrument panel, and continued the flight.  The airplane maintained a gradual descent as it flew south of the airport, then completed a left turn to the north on the downwind leg.  It continued to descend until it collided with the terrain.  The pilot, at some time in the past, had significant surgery on at least one of his eyes, including a corneal transplant.  Such surgery can result in complications that substantially impair vision.  The lighting level in the cockpit, with the additional lighting from the flashlights, would have essentially prohibited any dark-adaptation of the pilot's vision, and interfered with him seeing anything clearly outside the airplane.  Analysis of specimens for the pilot was positive for the following drugs: Benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester (inactive metabolites of cocaine), cocaine, Temazepam, Oxazepam, and acetaminophen.  The pilot was likely impaired by the effects of cocaine withdrawal, and possibly by the use of a prescription sleeping aid.  The use of a medication for control of pain/fever symptoms implies that such symptoms were significant.  Distraction, sensory disturbance, or impaired judgment as a result of illness could have conceivably played some role in this accident.  It is also possible, but less likely, that the pilot had an acute event that resulted in incapacitation (fainting or seizure, for example) as a result of his drug use.  The pilot and passenger were both thrown forward and to the right by the impact.  The lack of shoulder restraint concentrated deceleration forces on the lap belt resulting in separation of the floor to which the seat belt attached.  The damage, deformation, and fractures were typical of a single overload event, and indicate substantial forward rotation of the attachment point during the separation process.  This and centrifugal force allowed the pilot to strike the instrument console to his right. ",

Witnesses reported that the pilot had aborted an earlier flight when he returned to the airport and told the mechanic that he had a right engine fire warning light.  The discrepancy could not be duplicated during maintenance, and the airplane departed.  About 23 minutes after departure, the pilot reported to air traffic control that he needed to return to the airport to have something checked out.  The pilot did not report to anyone why he decided to return to the departure airport, and he flew over four airports when he returned to the departure airport.

The airplane's altitude was about 800 feet agl when it crossed the final approach course for runway 35.

The flight instructor and the private pilot looked for a suitable place to land. Their first choice was an airport, but due to the prevailing wind, they were unable to make it to the airport. Their second choice was a highway, but it also proved to be unsuitable due to the amount of automobile traffic. As they descended through 2,000 feet msl, they considered deploying the Cirrus Aircraft Parachute System (CAPS) but noticed a light colored patch of ground, which appeared to be a hard dirt surface; they thought landing there would be a better option than deploying the CAPS. During the final approach, while in ground effect, the flight instructor observed a mound of dirt that was directly in front of the airplane, and he deployed 50-percent wing flaps to \"balloon\" the airplane over the obstacle. The wheels touched down on a water-filled marshy area, and the airplane slid over a mound of dirt and came to rest in the marshy area. A review of onboard recorded data showed that fluctuations of the No. 2 cylinder's exhaust gas temperature were present beginning at engine start. Examination of the engine revealed that the engine had a hole in the top of the crankcase and that both magnetos had separated from their mounting locations. Further examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2 connecting rod bearing had been starved of oil and released from the crankshaft. The No. 2 main bearing had shifted and the lock slot in the crankcase was damaged, which indicated that the crankcase through bolts were not properly torqued. The No. 2 main bearing was fractured, and portions were missing from the steel backing, and the No. 2 and No. 3 piston pin bushings were also missing bushing material, which indicated that, during maintenance, a service bulletin had not been complied with. Review of the manufacturer's overhaul schedule also revealed that the recommended time between overhauls was 2,000 hours. At the time of the accident, the engine had accrued 2,978.1 total hours of operation without overhaul. Review of the airplane and engine manufacturers guidance also revealed that because engine cooling was accomplished by discharging heat to the oil in the engine the engine should not be operated with less than 6 quarts of oil. The flight instructor however, stated that he added oil to the engine during the preflight to bring it up to 5 quarts. He also advised that was the level they always serviced it to, which indicated that in addition to the engine having been inadequately maintained, the engine was also continuously operated below the minimum specified oil level.",
            "probable_cause": "The inadequate servicing and maintenance of the engine and the airplane owner and maintenance personnel's disregard of the manufacturer's recommended engine overhaul schedule and service bulletins, which resulted in an in-flight internal failure and seizure of the engine."

According to the Piper pilot, after the controller acknowledged the cancellation request, the pilot retuned his radio to the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) and announced his intention for landing. Due to the wind direction, the Piper pilot elected to circle and land on Runway 15, which was in the opposite direction of his approach. The pilot of a Beech A36, who was ready to depart from Runway 5 of the same airport, and who was also on an IFR flight plan, requested permission to take off but was told to \"hold for release\" by the controller.

The test flight was part of a new airplane certification test program and was to evaluate the airplane's audio design/flight deck audio system.  The flight crew did not receive any fire warning indications in-flight and neither they or the test crew members noted any smoke or odors associated with burning during the flight.  The inverter was located in the aft equipment bay, aft of the rear pressure bulkhead.  The area within which the inverter was located was equipped with fire detection and an airplane circuit breaker for the system.  The airplane circuit breaker for the inverter was not tripped. Subsequent testing demonstrated that the circuit breaker operated within specification limits.Inspection of the airplane revealed the presence of hydraulic fluid below and in the inverter tray. Examination of the inverter and fluid susceptibility testing confirmed the presence of Skydrol hydraulic fluid within the inverter.  The inverter manufacturer reported that Skydrol intrusion, internal power circuit high voltages, operation at altitude, and drastic changes in temperature may have contributed to material degradation or deterioration or even possible dielectic breakdown, which resulted in the failure mode observed.  Following this incident, the manufacturer reported that the inverter design was tested and confirmed that it met the fluid susceptibility requirements of DO-160C for Skydrol.  A second examination of the inverter, performed by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory, was documented in a laboratory evaluation report.  The failure analysis section of this report states that no root cause of failure could be found and noted that the majority of the thermal damage to the inverter was attributed to Joule heating from a sustained current overload.  The examination also revealed the existence of numerous manufacturing deficiencies that would be classified as defects per Joint Industry Standard requirements for soldered electrical and electronic assemblies.  The majority of these defects violated cleanliness, conformal coating, and soldering.  The inverter manufacturer's FAA approved manufacturing requirements differ from those noted by the Air Force Research Laboratory and are based on its own internal design standards and practices as well as in-house workmanship standards derived from good industry practice and requirements contained in IPC-A-610C, \"Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies\".The inverter was part of a cabin outlet system considered non-essential under 14 CFR Part 25, Subpart F.  Information contained in Advisory circular 25-10 regarding guidance for installation of miscellaneous, non-required equipment states. that circuit protective devices should be provided such that a fault in the nonrequired system does not cause a failure of a required system.  Supplementing this guidance, AC 25-16, \"Electrical Fault and Fire Prevention and Protection,\" states that in cases where internally faulted components will not cause automatic disconnection of their circuit protective devices before causing excess temperatures potentially resulting in fire, these electrical equipment should be provided with adequate backup protection (beyond the aircraft circuit breakers).  In addition, the AC states that each installation of an electrical device should be assessed for its potential to generate fire or smoke under failure conditions.  The inverter specified for this installation was a TSO-C73 certified article.  The applicable TSO addresses short circuit and overload conditions to the extent that inverters continue producing power through these conditions, but it does not require circuit protection when these conditions are encountered.  A design analysis of the inverter as installed in the cabin outlet system to consider failure conditions and corresponding hazards such as fire/smoke generation, in accordance with the related provisions of 14 CFR Part 25.1309, had not been performed by the aircraft manufacturer prior to this incident.  As a result, additional requirements to address internal inverter circuit protection for this installation were not mandated by the aircraft manufacturer.  Subsequent to this incident, a design analysis was performed by the airplane manufacturer.  Correspondingly, the inverter manufacturer modified the inverter design to incorporate fuses on the power input lines to interrupt electrical power in the event a short circuit or overload failure condition develops inside the inverter.",
            "probable_cause": "The uninterrupted current overload of the cabin outlet system static inverter leading to ignition and sustained fire.  The cause of the initiating overload condition could not be determined. Contributing factors were the lack of adequate current overload protection for the static inverter due to a failure to adequately assess fire/smoke hazards of the inverter in this installation and the absence of timely fire annunciation to the flight crew."

He said that he was cleared to land by air traffic control (ATC).  He checked the landing gear down indication lights, and when he looked up again, black smoke was coming from the dash.  He looked down at the control pedestal and saw smoke and fire; he said black smoke immediately eliminated outside visibility.  The pilot said that the passenger reported seeing the runway out his open window.  The pilot landed the airplane, which bounced, and on the second touchdown the front nose gear collapsed and the airplane skidded to a stop.  He and the passenger exited the airplane, which subsequently was consumed by the ensuing fire.  The airplane's maintenance records indicated that the following maintenance had been done since the beginning of the year: 1. On January 28, 2005, the engine was removed and a remanufactured engine installed.  2. On March 18, 2005, an annual inspection was completed.  3. On March 30, 2005, an inverter (located up/behind the instrument panel) was replaced.  4. On April 11, 2005, the altimeter was replaced with an overhauled one.  Postaccident investigation of the landing gear hydraulic pump (located up/behind the instrument panel) and its associated tubular plumbing found several fractures and failures.  A NTSB metallurgist examined the hydraulic lines and found no evidence of preexisting cracking or fractures; using a scanning electron microscope, he identified typical intergranular features with rounded edges, which are indicative of high temperature overstress failures.  A NTSB fire expert examined the main wire bundle from under the instrument panel and said that due to the extent of fire damage, an ignition source for the fire could not be determined.",

According to witnesses near the accident site, the airplane was at a low altitude and trailing smoke.  They described the airplane flying in a downwind and base type pattern to an open area where the airplane crashed. The witnesses reported the airplane impacted terrain while in a steep left-hand turn, and was fully engulfed by fire after impact. Shortly before crashing, the pilot reported that he had engine problems, and the airplane was on fire. Examination of the wreckage revealed a black, oil-like substance along the leading edge of the right stabilizer. In addition, heavy dark soot and oil deposits were on the bottom of the engine, starting below the number six cylinder in the area of the waste gate controller, and extending to the rear of the engine near the accessory case. The turbo charger waste gate is actuated by oil pressure supplied by an inlet oil supply hose and an oil return hose. Examination of the two Aeroquip metal-braided nonfire shielded hoses revealed that both were covered in a dark soot and an oil like substance. In addition, both oil lines appeared thermally damaged. The waste gate actuator inlet line was pressure tested, and a leak was noted between the hose collar and the B-nut on the actuator side of the hose. The oil return line was pressure tested, and multiple leaks were noted along a 14-inch section of the hose. The steel braided outer cover of the hose was removed, and the inside rubber hose was found deteriorated and oil soaked. A review of the maintenance log book records disclosed no specific entry related to the installation of nonfire shielded Aeroequip hoses. A representative from the engine manufacturer stated the steel braided Aeroequip hoses found on the accident airplane were not supplied by the engine manufacturer.

The pilot had heard a bang followed by illumination of the engine out warning light, and the engine began smoking.  During the terminal phase of the autorotation, the pilot assumed the grass height was 3 feet and flared accordingly; however, the grass was at least 6 feet tall.  Post-accident examination of the engine revealed that the No. 1 turbine wheel was missing.  The No. 8 bearing thrust nut exhibited a locking indentation and a notch on its inside surface.  Additionally, indentations were on the threads of the threaded end of the first stage turbine wheel shaft.  These marks suggest that the thrust nut was not fully engaged on the first stage turbine shaft.  The location of the notch suggests that the edge of the nut protruded beyond the end of the turbine shaft.  There were no indications of contact by the shaft threads on the inner surface of the deformed area to suggest that it had been displaced into a groove on the first stage turbine shaft.  Review of the maintenance records and interviews with the mechanic, who performed the most recent maintenance work, revealed that the turbine section had been replaced approximately 30 hours prior to the accident.  Due to excessive oil consumption, maintenance personnel removed the turbine and replaced the No. 5 carbon seal approximately 14 hours prior to the accident.  The maintenance records indicated that the day before the accident, the sump cover had been removed for trouble shooting oil consumption.  Though it is not detailed in the maintenance entry, it is interpreted that the \"sump cover\" referred to is the No. 8 Bearing sump nut since the thrust nut was loose.",

The pilot's wife, a passenger who sat in the front right seat, said they did not encounter any weather until they arrived at their destination.  The rain began hitting the windshield so hard, that it was hard to hear the air traffic controller.  The pilot made one attempt to land, but was unable to see out of the front windshield due to the heavy rain, and elected to go-around.  He pushed the throttles full forward, and  attempted to climb, but stated that the airplane would not climb.  A witness, a flight instructor with over 17,000 of flight time, saw the airplane over the runway, in a climb.
