He followed emergency procedures and switched on the boost pump. The engine regained full power momentarily, but then experienced a gradual loss of power. The airplane was brought to minimum controllable airspeed (MCA), and settled in the tree tops. There was a post crash fire following the collision. According to the pilot, emergency procedures were followed, and the carburetor temperature gauge appeared normal from a glance. The weather conditions were favorable for the formation of carburetor ice, and the pilot reported that he did not use the carburetor heat. Conversations with other operators of the same type aircraft and the engine manufacturer revealed that there is a problem with the aircraft induction airbox. The airbox problem causes the engine to run rough. Leaning of the engine exacerbates the condition, and introduction of carburetor heat increases engine RPM rather than decreasing RPM. ",

The student told the controller that the left fuel gage indicated FULL and the right fuel gage indicated EMPTY.  The controller issued the student suggested headings to the nearest airport.  The student pilot located the airport and entered the traffic pattern for a landing on runway 17.  During the landing roll to the south, the airplane bounced, exited the runway into the grass, and the student performed a go-around.  Subsequently, the student landed the airplane to the north on runway 35.  Witnesses reported the airplane remained on the runway with the elevators up, flaps retracted, and the propeller turning, before it rolled off the end of the runway at an \"estimated speed of 30 mph.\"  Witnesses never saw or heard any indication of braking, nor the addition of power.  The airplane struck a vehicle traveling east at 60 mph on an interstate highway located north of the airport.  Winds at the time of the accident were from the south at 20 knots.  The accident flight time was 2.3 hours.  Examination of the airplane's fuel system and its maintenance records revealed that the original left fuel tank transmitter (manufactured by Stewart Warner) was replaced in October 1999 with a new transmitter (manufactured by Rochester).  Research revealed that by 1991, the Stewart Warner transmitters and fuel gages were no longer procurable for the airplane, and the Rochester transmitters and gages were to be installed by Service Bulletin (SB)/Service Kit (SK).  According to the SB/SK, installation of a Rochester transmitter also requires installation of a Rochester gage.  Neither the SB nor the SK had been complied with on the accident airplane.   The Rochester gage assembly requires an aluminum back plate.   Both fuel gages found in the airplane were Stewart Warner and the back plate was steel.  According to the manufacturer representative, \"with the Rochester transmitter installed with the Stewart Warner fuel gage, the gage indication would increase as the fuel level in the tank got lower.\"  Physical evidence of fuel leakage from the left tank was found at the tank, the tank fitting, and the inboard wing where the tank was installed.  No evidence was found of an in-flight mechanical and or flight/control malfunction that would have rendered the airplane uncontrollable prior to the impact.",

After consulting with their maintenance department, the crew landed and, during rollout, the left main gear collapsed. Postaccident examination revealed the drag leg assembly was fractured. When the gear collapsed, a portion of the wing spar was torn out. Metallurgical examination revealed that both lugs that attach to the landing gear actuator and the rig plate were fractured and the drag leg was bent. The right-hand lug contained a fatigue crack that progressed to an overload failure. The other lug fractured completely through overload. The damage was pre-existent to that cracking, and served as a stress concentrator leading to the initiation of a fatigue crack. Spectrographic analysis of the upper drag leg arm showed that it met specified chemical composition requirements. At time of accident the aircraft had operated about 82.9 hours and 95 cycles since a detailed inspection of the landing gear was accomplished on May 28, 2010; no discrepancies related to the lug were noted at that time.",

While performing the tests, the airplane's ground speed became excessive and it encountered a gust of wind. The airplane unintentionally became airborne and continued to climb. The pilot attempted to return back to the airport but the engine experienced a total loss of power. The airplane subsequently collided with a telephone pole and descended nose-low onto the road below. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector performed a postaccident examination of the airframe and engine. During the disassembly of the fuel line connecting the gascolator to the carburetor, he observed a condition inside the line known as a \"flapper valve\" at both end fittings. The inspector stated that this was the fuel line that the pilot had recently fabricated. He stated that the \"flapper valve\" condition can occur as a result of the end fittings being installed without using a mandrel, where the fitting edge cuts the inside of the hose creating a valve-like piece that obstructs fuel flow.",

While descending for approach to a ball field about 250 to 300 feet above ground level (agl) at an indicated airspeed between 60-65 knots, the helicopter yawed.  He corrected the yaw with anti-torque pedal and noted that the engine rpm and main rotor rpm needles were \"split\"; the main rotor rpm was in the green arc and the engine rpm was indicating zero.  He rolled the throttle to the right towards the fuel-on position, then lowered full collective and maintained 40-45 knots while descending for an autorotative landing to the down sloping road.  He cleared a bridge ahead and at approximately 15 feet agl, he applied aft cyclic to decelerate \"somewhat\", and pulled full collective.  He touched down at an indicated airspeed between 20 and 30 knots on the road that curved to the left and later reported, \"we didn't hit real easy.\"  He lowered full collective after touchdown and while sliding, the right skid contacted grass on the side of the road causing the right skid to collapse.  The helicopter then rolled onto its right side and slid approximately 4-5 feet before coming to rest.  There was no postcrash fire or fuel leakage.  Examination of the helicopter by an FAA Airworthiness Inspector revealed 8-9 gallons of fuel on board; the carburetor bowl was found approximately 1/2 full with a slight amount of contamination.  The engine driven fuel pump would not produce 2 psi flow and would not produce any flow with a minor restriction.  Additionally, the auxiliary fuel pump strainer was \"so clogged and corroded it had to be removed with a metal hook and screw driver.\"  The helicopter was inspected last in accordance with a 100-Hour inspection that was signed off on January 5, 2001; the helicopter had accumulated approximately 24 hours since the inspection at the time of the accident.  Review of the helicopter flight manual pertaining to engine failure when flying above 325 feet agl revealed to maintain 50-60 mph glide speed and to pull cyclic stick steadily back at approximately 75 feet agl.  Additionally, \"when 10-15 feet above the landing surface, level the helicopter with forward cyclic stick and then apply collective pitch, as necessary, to cushion the landing impact.\"  The flight manual also states, \"To reduce the rate of descent and forward speed during an autorotation landing, the helicopter's flight path should be flared or leveled out, prior to ground contact.\"  Excerpts from the flight manual is an attachment to this report.",

Witnesses reported that the airplane lifted off from the 1,800-foot-long grass runway; however, none of the witnesses observed the airplane crash shortly after takeoff. The airplane rolled left and impacted the ground inverted in a wooded area near the departure end of the runway; there was no postcrash fire.Examination of the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Damage to one of the right engine propeller blades was consistent with engine power at impact, whereas the left engine propeller blades showed no evidence of power at impact. Thus it is likely that the left engine experienced a total loss of power just after takeoff, which the pilot was unable to control. Both engines were removed, transported to the manufacturer\u2019s facility, and test run with no mechanical discrepancies noted. Rust-colored water was detected in various fuel system components from both engines. Further, the strainer drain lines and outer tank drains in both engines\u2019 fuel systems were partially blocked by rust-colored debris.  Postaccident examination revealed evidence of long-term water contamination of both engines\u2019 fuel systems due to leakage past the fuel caps, which are normally replaced on an \u201con-condition\u201d basis during maintenance. The engine failure was likely due to the water contamination in the fuel system, which was not detected by the pilot during the preflight inspection. Further, the leaking fuel caps most likely existed, but went undetected, when the airplane\u2019s most recent annual inspection was performed about 4 months earlier. A review of airplane maintenance records revealed that the only entry related to the fuel filler caps since the airplane was manufactured in 1972 was dated July 2010, at which time the left fuel filler cap was replaced and an outer o-ring of the incorrect dimension was installed. In April 2011, as a result of a 2008 investigation of a Canadian registered Beech 58 airplane that had water enter the fuel tank due to deteriorated fuel filler cap o-rings, the manufacturer revised the maintenance manual of Beech 55 and 58-series airplanes to require fuel cap overhaul. Maintenance manual guidance in effect when the accident airplane\u2019s most recent annual inspection was performed excluded the accident airplane (by serial number) from this overhaul.  Since this accident, the manufacturer has revised its Beech 55 and 58 maintenance manuals to include the fuel cap overhaul requirement for all potentially affected airplanes, including the accident airplane.

Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s inadequate preflight inspection of the airplane and maintenance personnel\u2019s inadequate annual inspection, because both failed to detect the long-term water contamination of the fuel system and the deteriorated outer o-rings on both fuel caps. Also contributing to the water contamination of the fuel system was the inaccurate information and instructions in the airplane maintenance manual pertaining to overhaul requirements of the fuel filler caps."

Video footage and photographs of the final portion of the accident routine revealed that the airplane exited a Lomcevak maneuver into a right-hand, inverted spin. The pilot recovered from the inverted spin, but the airplane immediately entered a left upright spin. (Most of the time, a recovery from the Lomcevak maneuver would be straight ahead, but occasionally recovery from an inverted spin would be necessary.) The airplane appeared to yaw left during the final descent, completing about 1 1/2 revolutions before impacting the ground and then coming to rest upright. The photographs indicated that the airplane was intact; however, the elevators were deflected upward, which was inconsistent with a spin recovery. The pilot's friend reported that the pilot appeared to initiate the Lomcevak maneuver more aggressively than he had seen during previous airshow performances. Another friend, who had trained with the pilot and was familiar with the routine, reported that the Lomcevak maneuver completed during the accident flight included an extra rotation. All major airframe components were observed in place relative to the overall airframe. A postaccident examination of the airplane and a teardown examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure or malfunction. No evidence of an in-flight structural failure was observed.Toxicology testing indicated the distant use of Valium by the pilot; however, it is not likely to have been directly impairing at the time of the accident. A review of the pilot's medical records indicated that he had sought treatment for vertigo after feeling off-balance and nauseated while conducting aerobatics; additionally, the pilot reported that he had fallen after getting out of the airplane. An initial medical evaluation was conducted, and further treatment was prescribed; however, the records indicated that the pilot did not return for treatment. In addition, autopsy results revealed that the pilot suffered from severe coronary artery disease and had an enlarged heart and a congenital valve anomaly. Histology of the right and left ventricle walls was consistent with myocardial ischemia. These conditions placed the pilot at an increased risk of an acute coronary event, including a cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death, although insufficient evidence exists to determine whether the pilot experienced an acute cardiac event at the time of the accident. The extent that vertigo might have caused the accident could not be determined; however, the persistence of the vertigo symptoms after completion of aerobatic maneuvers suggested that it might have played a role in the pilot's loss of control.",

AIRMETs current for the time and area of the accident flight forecast mountain obscuration in clouds and moderate icing conditions between 12,000 and 25,000 feet. The pilot\u2019s assigned altitude was 21,000 feet, and radar data indicated that the airplane was cruising at 20,900 feet with varying altitudes of plus or minus 100 feet for about 25 minutes. A few minutes before the accident, the air traffic controller issued the pilot a clearance to descend from 21,000 feet to 16,000 feet, which the pilot acknowledged.

The airframe was heavily fragmented, and only a limited examination could be accomplished due to impact damage. The engine was also severely impact damaged; however, examination of the available components revealed no evidence of abnormalities that would have prevented normal operation. Based on the available weather data for the area of the accident flight, it is likely that the flight encountered the forecast icing conditions. Moderate intensity icing is defined as a rate of accumulation such that even short encounters become potentially hazardous, and the use of deicing and anti-icing equipment or diversion is necessary. The airplane was not equipped for flight in icing conditions.",

The FAA's airplane registry still has the builder listed as owner, with a sale reported to another party, but not to the pilot. The pilot told an FAA inspector that he bought the airplane as a \"no regulation\" aircraft on E Bay. He assembled the airplane, installed a single seat, and rebuilt the Rotax engine  about 30 hours before the accident. The airplane did not have a current registration, nor an airworthiness certificate. As part of the pilot's preflight before the accident flight, he drained and refilled the fuel tank. He then ran the engine, on the ground, for about 30 minutes. He then departed for one turn around the airport traffic pattern, and landed. He rechecked the engine and decided to depart for his intended destination. The pilot said that he just turned out from the local traffic pattern about 700 feet above the ground when the engine lost power. He tried to turn back toward the airport, but the airplane's glide capabilities were poor.

The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to Del Air Enterprises II, LLC, and was operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 while on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight that departed Willmar Municipal Airport (BDH), Willmar, Minnesota, about 1829.According to preliminary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control data, at 2050:47 (hhmm:ss), the accident flight established contact with Dallas-Fort Worth Terminal Radar Approach Control and reported being level at 4,000 feet mean sea level (msl). According to radar data, the flight was located about 35 miles northwest of DTO and was established on a southbound course at 4,000 feet msl. The approach controller issued the current weather conditions at DTO and told the pilot to expect the GPS runway 36 approach. At 2052:57, the approach controller told the pilot to fly direct WOBOS, an intermediate fix associated with the instrument approach. The plotted radar data showed the airplane turned to the south-southeast to a direct course toward WOBOS. At 2059:35, the flight was cleared to descend to maintain 3,000 feet msl and the pilot acknowledged the altitude clearance.At 2101:24, the DTO tower controller advised the approach controller that a Cessna 172 had just landed at DTO and that the pilot reported light-to-moderate turbulence during approach along with an inflight visibility of about 1.5 miles. The approach controller subsequently advised the accident pilot of the light-to-moderate turbulence. At 2103:09, the flight was cleared to descend to maintain 2,500 feet msl and the pilot acknowledged the altitude clearance.At 2103:23, the approach controller told the pilot to turn to a south heading. The pilot acknowledged the heading change and subsequently turned southbound. According to radar data, at 2104:09, the airplane descended below 2,500 feet msl. At 2104:26, the approach controller told the pilot to turn to an east heading. The pilot acknowledged the heading change, but according to radar data did not initiate the turn as requested. The airplane continued to descend while on a southbound course until reaching 2,100 feet msl at 2104:46 when it began to climb. At 2104:59, after establishing that the flight had not turned to the assigned heading, the approach controller told the pilot to turn to a heading of 080 degrees. The pilot acknowledged the assigned heading and radar data showed the flight entering a climbing left turn toward the east.At 2105:40, when the flight was 8 miles from the final approach fix (NULUX), the approach controller told the pilot to turn to a heading of 030 to intersect the final approach course, to maintain 2,500 feet msl until established on the final approach course, and that the flight was cleared for the GPS runway 36 approach. The pilot responded, \"Okay, 030 maintain 2.5 until established on the approach.\" According to radar data, the flight turned to a north heading instead of the assigned heading of 030 degrees. At 2106:17, the approach controller told the pilot to contact the DTO tower controller and the pilot replied with the correct frequency change. The flight continued due north until 2106:38, when it turned to a 030 degree course and subsequently descended through 2,500 feet msl at 2107:01. At 2107:16, the pilot established communications with the DTO tower controller. The tower controller told the pilot that the surface wind was 360 degrees at 19 knots with 25 knot gusts, and then cleared the flight to land on runway 36. The tower controller also asked the pilot if he had received the pilot report (PIREP) that had been issued by the proceeding Cessna 172. The pilot confirmed that he had received the PIREP from the approach controller. According to radar data, the airplane continued to descend as it intersected the final approach course and continued northbound toward NULUX.At 2108:44, the automated air traffic control system issued a low altitude alert for the accident flight. The system presented the low altitude alert on both the control tower and the approach control radar displays. According to radar data, at the time of the low altitude alert, the airplane had descended to about 1,500 feet msl. At 2108:51, the tower controller told the pilot to \"... check your altitude, you are still a couple of miles from the marker (NULUX), and uh believe your altitude should be about 2,100 there.\" The pilot replied, \"Okay, going back up.\" According to radar data, following the altitude alert, the airplane continued to descend until the final radar return, recorded at 2109:11, about 2.5 miles south of NULUX at 1,000 feet msl (about 300 feet above the ground). At 2109:12, the tower controller transmitted again that the airplane was lower than the specified minimum descent altitude (2,000 feet msl) for that segment of the instrument approach. There was no response from the accident pilot.According to preliminary airplane performance calculations, based on available radar data, during the time period 2106:43 to 2108:43, the airplane's ground speed decreased from about 145 knots to 95 knots and the airplane descended from 2,400 feet msl to 1,500 feet msl. During the final 28 seconds of radar data, the airplane's ground speed further decreased from 95 knots to 55 knots, while the descent rate decreased from 1,300 feet per minute to 650 feet per minute.The flight path of the accident airplane was captured by a security video camera installed on the exterior of a building that was located about 1/2 mile southeast of the accident site. The video camera, which was facing west, captured the accident airplane's wingtip navigation and strobe lights as it crossed from left to right at the upper portion of the camera's field of view. According to a preliminary review of the camera footage, the airplane entered the camera's field of view at 2108:48 and appeared to be in a wings level descent as it continued across the first half of the camera's lateral field of view. At 2109:00, the descent angle increased substantially before the airplane entered a near-vertical spiraling descent. The airplane's navigational lights and strobes were not visible after 2109:09.According to 911-emergency calls received following the accident, several individuals reported hearing an airplane overfly their position at a low altitude followed by the sound of a large ground impact. According to first responders with the Argyle Fire Department, upon arrival at the accident site, there was no evidence of ice or frost accumulation on the airplane's fuselage, wings, or tail. Additionally, the first responders reported that there was a substantial smell of Jet-A fuel at the accident site; however, there was no evidence of an explosion or postimpact fire. The pilot was seated in the left cockpit seat and was secured by a lap belt. The available shoulder harness did not appear to have been used.The airplane wreckage was found in a grass-covered industrial storage yard located about 6.35 nautical miles (nm) south of the runway 36 threshold. The accident site was 400 feet northeast of the final radar return and about 207 feet right of the final approach course. There was no appreciable wreckage debris path identified at the accident site. The entire lower fuselage surface was crushed upward, consistent with a vertical impact while in a near level pitch attitude. The airplane tail section was found partially separated immediately aft of the aft pressure bulkhead. The vertical stabilizer, rudder, horizontal stabilizers, and elevators remained relatively undamaged. The leading edges of both wings, propeller spinners, and the airframe radome did not exhibit evidence of a ground impact. Aileron control cable continuity was established through an overstress separation of the aileron sector drive cable in the mid cabin area and a separation of the balance cable near the right wing root. All other flight control cables were continuous from the cockpit control inputs to their respective flight control surfaces. The landing gear was found extended. The wing flaps were found extended about 10-degrees. The stall warning horn and landing gear warning horn were extracted from the cockpit and both horns produced an aural tone when electrical power was applied. Switch continuity for the wing-mounted lift sensor was confirmed with an Ohmmeter. The left side altimeter's Kollsman window was centered on 30.24 inches-of-mercury. The right side altimeter's Kollsman window was centered on 30.09 inches-of-mercury. Both engines remained attached to their respective wing nacelle structures. The first stage compressor impeller of each engine exhibited blade tip bends that were opposite the direction of rotation and/or visible scoring as result of the rotating compressor impeller coming in contact with its respective shroud. The third axial turbine stage of each engine exhibited re-solidified metallic splatter on the turbine nozzle. The observed damage to the first compressor stage and third turbine stage was consistent with each engine operating at the time of impact. Both propeller assemblies remained attached to their respective engines. There were two approximately 12-inch deep holes observed aside and slightly behind the engines where the rotating propellers had dug into the soil. Both propellers exhibited significant bending of their blades opposite the direction of rotation. Additionally, all propeller blades exhibited leading edge gouges, chordwise scratches, and polishing of the cambered side.At 2103, the DTO automated surface observing system reported: wind 350 degrees at 17 knots, gusting 25 knots; an overcast ceiling at 900 feet above ground level (agl); 2 mile surface visibility with light rain and mist; temperature 3 degrees Celsius; dew point 3 degrees Celsius; and an altimeter setting of 30.26 inches of mercury.The airplane's multi-hazard awareness system, the cockpit annunciator panel, and a cockpit multi-function display were retained for additional examination. Both engines and their control units were retained for possible teardown and/or testing. Additionally, the pilot's personal mobile phone, tablet computer, and a handheld device that provided his mobile devices with Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) information, weather data, ADS-B traffic, and GPS data were retained for potential retrieval of non-volatile data.",

The airline transport pilot and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, an instrument flight plan had been filed for the flight from Penn Valley Airport (SEG), Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania to Albert Ellis Airport (OAJ), Jacksonville, North Carolina, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot's written statement, while enroute at 8,000 feet above mean sea level (msl) the aircraft suffered a total electrical failure.  The pilot was unable to communicate with air traffic control and elected to divert to 58M.  The pilot executed an emergency descent and exited instrument meteorological conditions at 3,000 feet msl.  The pilot stated that he had a passenger contact Harrisburg Approach Control via cell phone and advised them of his intentions. Once the pilot visually acquired 58M, he elected to enter the traffic pattern for runway 13.   Approximately midfield on the downwind leg, the pilot attempted to lower the flaps to 15 degrees.  The flaps however would not extend and remained in the full up position.  Upon turning onto the base leg the pilot engaged the \"second and third notch of flaps.\"  The flaps continued to remain in the full up position.  The pilot stated that his approach speed was 75 knots on final approach.  Upon touchdown the airplane encountered a wet runway.  The pilot was unable to stop the airplane and it overran the runway, struck a fence, and incurred substantial damage to the fuselage.  According to the airport facility directory, 58M was uncontrolled. Field elevation was 106 feet.  Runway 13 was 2,989 feet long and 70 feet wide. The threshold was displaced by 288 feet. It was marked with basic markings in poor condition, and was equipped with a precision approach path indicator and runway end identifier lights. It sloped steeply toward the departure end of the runway and obstructions were present on the final approach path in the form of 74 foot high trees located 919 feet from the the runway, and 280 feet left of the centerline which took a 9:1 slope to clear.   According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and pilot records, the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane multi-engine land, and airplane single-engine land and private pilot privileges for rotorcraft-helicopter, and a type rating in the CE-525S.  He also held private pilot privileges in rotorcraft-helicopter. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on October 5, 2012. He reported that he had accrued approximately 3,960 total flight hours.According to FAA and airplane maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 1998. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on June 1, 2013. At the time of accident, the airplane had accrued approximately 1,103 total hours of operation.",

After touchdown the airplane started to turn to the left. He tried to correct the turn but was unable. The airplane did a ground loop to the left at the intersection of the runway and taxiway A4. The pilot stated in his written statement to NTSB that he held over Lake Parker until released to continue inbound to Lakeland Regional Airport. Due to crosswind, approximately 10 knots gusting, he was instructed to land on taxiway 27R. On the landing roll out, the brakes failed, he could not maintain directional control, and the airplane ground looped. Examination of the airplane was performed by FAA Maintenance Inspectors, the day after the accident, after the airplane was recovered from the runway. A functional check of the brakes was performed and the left brake pedal offered little or no resistance when pushed. The right brake exhibited normal resistance (back-pressure) when pushed. No evidence of fluid leakage was found around the actuators or at the brake assemblies. The recorded winds at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport at 0946 were from 190 degrees at 8 knots.",

The company's chief pilot said a moose was shot with a tranquilizer dart from the helicopter, and that the helicopter was used to block the moose from moving into a hazardous area.  The pilot of an airplane orbiting above said the moose charged the helicopter, and that as the helicopter attempted to evade the moose, the moose reared, or jumped, contacting the helicopter's tail rotor.  The helicopter pilot reported a loss of directional control, and made a hovering autorotation to the ground.  The flex coupling between the drive shaft and the tail rotor gearbox failed, and the spinning drive shaft cut the tail boom and separated the tail from the rest of the airframe.

The captain was the president, the director of operations, and the sole corporate entity of the company.  No current maintenance records, flight logs, or pilot logs were located for the company.  In the past, the captain's pilot certificate was suspended for 45 days following an accident in a DC-3 airplane when he ran out of gas.  Also, the captain's medical certificate had previously been considered for denial after serving 49 months in federal prison for cocaine distribution, but after review, the FAA issued the captain a first class medical.  FAA medical records for the captain do not contain any record of monitoring for substance abuse.  The first officer's medical had also been considered for denial after an episode of a loss of consciousness.  After a lengthy review and an appeal to the NTSB, the FAA issued the first officer a second-class medical.  The first officer was part of the flight crew when the captain ran out of gas, and she had two previous aviation accidents.  A toxicological examination of the captain, conducted by the FAA, found cocaine and metabolites of cocaine.  A toxicological examination of the first officer found two different prescription antidepressant drugs.  The FAA prohibits narcotic and mood-altering drug use by pilots.",
            "probable_cause": "The airplane flightcrew's failure to maintain adequate distance/altitude from mountainous terrain during a departure climb to cruise flight, and the captain's impairment from drugs.  Factors in the accident were dark night conditions, and the first officer's impairment from drugs."

The pilot continued to the hospital, landed, and performed an immediate engine shutdown. A mechanic disconnected the wiring to the MGB oil pressure switch and the light went out. The mechanic stated he believed the oil pressure switch had failed and he asked the pilot to run the helicopter, hover the helicopter, and if everything was normal, to fly it back to the base hospital. The pilot did the run and hover, and then departed the hospital. The helicopter crashed about 1 minute later. Witnesses stated they heard the helicopter approach the crash site at a low altitude and making a slow thumping noise. Examination of the MGB showed the oil pump idler gear had seized in the oil pump due to undetermined reasons and the oil pump drive shaft had failed due to overstress. The teeth on the engine input gears, intermediate gears, and MGB drive gear in the MGB combining gearbox had failed due to high-temperature overstress, which was the result of oil starvation. The helicopter was not equipped with a MGB oil pressure indicator. The maintenance procedure for trouble shooting an illuminated MGB oil pressure warning light is to first check the electrical circuit, and if this does not correct the problem, to change the oil pressure switch. The mechanic stated he did not have the maintenance manuals with him while working on the helicopter. The MGB had been installed in the helicopter after overhaul, 3 days and 4 flight hours before the accident. ",

About 500 feet above the ground, the captain said that he took control and initiated a go-around by adding full engine power. As power was increased, the yaw intensified, and the captain said he was unable to maintain altitude. As he called for the first officer to feather the right engine, the stall warning horn sounded and he had to use both hands to maintain control of the airplane. The airplane continued to descend, struck the tundra-covered terrain, and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage. The right engine propeller was not feathered at impact. A postaccident inspection revealed that the linkage connecting the cockpit-mounted engine power lever to the right engine propeller pitch control (PPC) was disconnected, and the bolt connecting the linkage to the PPC was missing. Company management reported that the right engine had been changed 237.2 flight hours before the accident, which required the removal and reinstallation of the PPC linkage.

            "narrative": "On August 5, 2014, about 1510 eastern daylight time, a Cessna model 177RG airplane, N468LE, was substantially damaged during takeoff on runway 19 (2,721 feet by 75 feet, asphalt) at the Manistee County Airport (MBL), Manistee, Michigan. The private pilot, flight instructor, and two passengers sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated by Great Lakes Air Ventures LLC under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country instructional flight that was en route to Mason County Airport (LDM), Ludington, Michigan.The flight instructor reported that the MBL weather station was inoperative during his preflight check of the weather conditions and that the main source of wind information was the airport's windsock. As the airplane taxied from the ramp area, the windsock indicated a light wind of variable direction that was primarily from the east. Believing that the winds were light-and-variable, the flight instructor told his student, a private pilot who was receiving flight instruction toward a complex airplane endorsement, to depart on runway 19 because the intended destination was south of the departure airport. The flight instructor reported that he calculated the runway length required to clear a 50-foot obstacle was about 1,850 feet at the airplane's maximum gross weight and with a calm wind condition. The student reportedly initially selected the wing flaps to 20 degrees, but the flight instructor noted the incorrect flap setting and told the student to select 10 degrees of wing flaps for the short-field takeoff. The takeoff was initiated from the end of the runway, to maximize available runway length, and by holding the wheel brakes until maximum engine power had been achieved. During the subsequent takeoff roll, the flight instructor noticed that the wing flaps were still incorrectly set at 20 degrees and changed them to 10 degrees for the short-field takeoff. The student called out rotation speed (66 knots) and began to apply aft elevator control input for takeoff. The flight instructor stated that the airplane achieved liftoff around 70 knots with about 1,000 feet of runway remaining. During initial climb, about 5-10 feet above the runway, the airplane experienced a sudden loss of airspeed and began to sink back toward the runway. The airplane touched-down at the runway departure threshold and continued down an embankment into a tree line located about 350 feet from the end of the runway. Following the accident, the flight instructor noted that the airport's windsock was indicating a north-to-northwest wind direction with wind gusts reaching 18-20 knots. He stated that the apparent wind change had resulted in a tailwind condition during the accident takeoff. Additionally, he reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have prevented its normal operation during the accident takeoff. The fuselage and both wings were substantially damaged during the accident.The automated surface observing system (ASOS) located at the departure airport (MBL) was not operational when the accident occurred. There was an active notice to airman (NOTAM) for the inoperative weather system. However, there was a valid terminal forecast issued for MBL at the time of the accident, which indicated a surface wind of 350 degrees at 7 knots.The next closest aviation weather observing system was located at the intended destination (LDM), which was 19.8 miles south of the MBL. At 1515, the LDM weather station reported: wind 310 degrees at 7 knots; visibility 10 miles; scattered clouds at 3,800 feet above ground level (agl), scattered clouds at 4,500 feet agl, and a broken ceiling at 9,500 feet agl; temperature 24 degrees Celsius, dew point 16 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.07 inches of mercury.",

The passenger reported that, following a normal departure, the airplane continued the takeoff climb through some cloud wisps and ascended above a lower cloud cover with an overcast layer above. Suddenly, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot maneuvered the airplane toward the closest airport, but, when he realized that the airplane would not be able to glide to the airport, he attempted to make an off-airport landing. The airplane stalled and then collided with terrain in an open area of a paper mill. Ground scar analysis and wreckage fragmentation revealed that the airplane descended in a steep, near-vertical, nose-down, left-wing-down attitude before it impacted terrain.\u000b\u000bThe pilot installed a fuel flow transducer about 2 to 3 weeks before the accident and used heavy applications of room temperature vulcanization (RTV) silicone to seal the fuel lines.

A bead of RTV silicone was found in the fuel line, and it is likely that it blocked the inlet of the transducer and starved the engine of fuel. Additionally, subsequent to the loss of engine power, the pilot failed to maintain sufficient airspeed while maneuvering to locate a suitable off-airport landing site and flew the airplane beyond its critical angle-of-attack, which resulted in a stall and loss of airplane control.\u000b",

Non-volatile memory from the cockpit instruments revealed that the engine power decreased to 1,200 and 1,750 rpms, while the fuel flow reached 30 gallons per hour (the maximum range of the fuel flow sensor). Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies except for the fitting cap on the throttle and metering assembly inlet, which was not installed. The cap was found resting on the cylinder baffle, and there was light blue staining on the crankcase indicating fuel leakage. During a postaccident engine run, the engine operated normally with a substitute cap installed finger tight. An annual inspection was completed about 11 flight hours prior to the accident, during which three engine cylinders were replaced. Following the cylinder replacement, the fuel system pressures were checked with instrumentation that was plumbed into the system at the throttle and metering assembly. Following the pressure tests, the line where the instrumentation was connected should have been secured with the fitting cap that was found not installed. The manufacturer\u2019s maintenance procedure requires that after the pressure tests are completed the cap be torqued and that a leak check be performed. Metallurgical examination of the cap showed that if it had been properly torqued it would have remained secure. Therefore, it is likely that the cap was installed finger tight and was not properly torqued when it was reinstalled. During the accident flight, the cap loosened and came off, resulting in a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation. There was no logbook entry for the most recent annual inspection, nor had the final items on the annual inspection checklist been completed. The Director of Maintenance for the facility had signed off the work order and returned the airplane to service. The assigned mechanic with inspection authorization indicated that he had not completed the annual inspection on the airplane and that the last maintenance he performed was that noted on the work order and annual inspection checklist. If the final checks had been completed, it is likely that the improperly secured cap would have been found because the fuel leakage would have been evident.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of maintenance personnel to properly secure a fitting cap on the throttle and metering assembly inlet after conducting a fuel system pressure check, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation. Contributing to the accident was the decision by the Director of Maintenance to return the airplane to service without verifying with the assigned inspector that all annual inspection items had been completed."

The commercial pilot/owner received fatal injuries. The exhibition flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight. The pilot was one of several civilian aerial demonstration pilots who performed at the two-day SUU \"Thunder Over Solano\" open house, which included both static (ground) and aerial (flight) displays. According to United States Air Force (USAF) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) information, Friday May 2 was the practice day, while the public event took place on Saturday and Sunday, May 3 and 4. The pilot flew two flight demonstration airplanes at the event, a North American P-51, and the accident airplane. All his flights preceding the accident flight were uneventful.The accident occurred during a \"ribbon-cut maneuver,\" whereby a ribbon was suspended transversely across the runway, between two poles held by ground crew personnel, and situated about 20 feet above the runway. The planned maneuver consisted of a total of three passes. The first two passes were to be conducted with the airplane upright, and were not planned to contact the ribbon. The final pass was to be conducted inverted, and the airplane would cut the ribbon with its vertical stabilizer. The first two passes were successful, but on the third (inverted, ribbon-cut) pass, the airplane was too high, and did not cut the ribbon. The pilot came around for a fourth pass, and rolled the airplane inverted after aligning with the runway. The airplane contacted the runway prior to reaching the ribbon, slid inverted between the ground crew personnel holding the poles, and came to a stop a few hundred feet beyond them. Ground scars consisted of rudder/ vertical stabilizer (\"tail\") and upper wing contact (metal and wood scrapes, and paint transfer) with the runway, as well as propeller \"slash marks\" approximately perpendicular to the direction of travel. Review of image and ground scar data indicated that the airplane first contacted the runway with its right wing, followed by the tail, the left wing, and then the propeller. The upper outboard right wing initial scar was followed about 7 feet later by the tail strike, and then a few feet later by the upper left wing. The initial tail strike was located about 45 feet right (northeast) of the runway centerline, about 380 feet beyond the runway threshold. The initial direction of travel was aligned approximately 5 degrees to the right (divergent from) the runway axis. The propeller slash marks began about 100 feet beyond the initial tail strike, and continued to the final resting location of the airplane. The slash marks described an arc, which curved to the left, and which resulted in the airplane coming to rest near the left (southwest) edge of the runway, on a magnetic heading of about 140 degrees. The airplane slid a total distance of about 740 feet.Review of still and moving images indicated that fire became visible just before the airplane came to a stop, and that the fire patterns were consistent with a pool fire of spilled fuel. Within about 50 seconds, the fire encompassed most of the right (downwind) side of the airplane. USAF rescue and firefighting vehicles and personnel arrived at the airplane about 3 to 4 minutes after the accident, and extinguished the fire. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) information indicated that the airplane was manufactured in 1944, and was first registered to the pilot in 1982. The airplane was equipped with a Pratt & Whitney R-985 series engine. The fuselage and empennage consisted of a synthetic-fabric covered steel tube structure, while the wings were primarily wood structure covered with the same type of fabric. The 47-gallon fuel tank was mounted in the center section of the upper wing, just forward of the cockpit. The cockpit was enclosed by a canopy, which consisted of a metal frame and plastic transparencies. The longitudinal section of the canopy consisted of one fixed section (right side) and two movable sections (top and left side). The top section was longitudinally hinged to the fixed right section and the movable left section, and the forward and aft bottom corners of the left section rode in transverse tracks at the forward and aft ends of the cockpit. That design allowed cockpit entry and egress by operating the top and left canopy sections in a manner similar to a bi-fold door; which required clearance above the canopy for the canopy to be opened.Preliminary examination of the wreckage indicated that most of the fabric covering on the fuselage was damaged or consumed by fire. The right wing and cockpit furnishings were almost completely consumed by fire, as were some of the aluminum flight control tubes. The left wing and rudder /vertical stabilizer sustained impact deformation, but the cockpit occupiable volume was not compromised by deformation of any surrounding structure. According to FAA information, the pilot held single- and multi-engine airplane, and instrument airplane ratings, and was authorized to fly several experimental airplanes. His most recent FAA second class medical certificate was issued in June 2013. The SUU 1358 automated weather observation included wind from 240 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 21, visibility 10 miles, few clouds at 18,000 feet, temperature 22 degrees C, dew point 12 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.99 inches of mercury.",

The airline transport pilot was not injured and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to Bill Leff Airshows LLC and was operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated from APF and was destined for Leesburg, Florida (LEE).The pilot reported the following. About 150 to 250 feet above the ground, during the initial climb, the engine lost all power. He lowered the landing gear, maintained flying airspeed, and landed the airplane in the grass, to the right of the runway. The airplane collided with a runway distance sign and came to a stop. The pilot turned off the magnetos, electrical master switch, and exited the airplane through the cockpit canopy.An inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration responded to the accident site and examined the wreckage. The fuselage, left wing, and right wing root exhibited structural damage from impact forces. The propeller was bent aft and the engine remained attached at the firewall. The engine turned freely when the propeller was rotated manually. The airplane was equipped with a JP Instruments EDM 700 engine monitoring system and a Shadin fuel flow indicator. The units were forwarded to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Division for examination and possible data retrieval.",

Smearing on the rivet shanks indicated a loading directionality from aft to forward, which is the direction of normal retraction for the nose gear.  No other damage was noted to the firewall or other airframe structures consistent with a hard landing.
