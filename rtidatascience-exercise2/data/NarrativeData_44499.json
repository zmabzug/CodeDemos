The commercial pilot was not injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by Semper Fi Aviation LLC under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local aerial application flight.The pilot reported that the aerial-application airplane weighed about 7,400 pounds after being loaded with 200 gallons of insecticide and 90 gallons of 100-low lead aviation fuel. The accident occurred during takeoff from runway 31 (4,500 feet by 75 feet, concrete). The pilot stated that the takeoff was uneventful until shortly after liftoff, about halfway down the runway, at an altitude of 3-4 feet above the runway, when he heard a \"loud bang\" and the airplane began to yaw to the left. The airplane descended and bounced on the runway. The pilot said that he increased aircraft pitch in an attempt to gain altitude, but the airplane encountered an aerodynamic stall. As he attempted to dump the load of insecticide, the airplane nosed over and impacted the terrain alongside the runway.A postaccident examination was completed by an inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) before the airplane had been recovered from the accident site. Examination of the runway surface revealed a skid mark starting about 1,000 feet from the runway end. The skid mark exhibited a wavy pattern that was consistent with the width of a main landing gear tire. The wavy tire marking continued about 30 feet until it departed the left runway edge. A second tire tread marking, located about 10 feet right of the wavy tire marking, began about 10 feet from the left edge of the runway. There were several propeller slash markings observed in the turf between where the airplane had departed the left side of the runway and the location of the main wreckage. The main wreckage was located about 100 feet left of the runway edge and about 750 feet from the end of the runway. The airplane came to rest inverted and was facing southeast. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, empennage, and firewall. The engine had separated from the fuselage. The propeller remained attached to the engine crankshaft.At 2053, the ICR weather observing system reported: wind 130 degrees at 8 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear sky conditions, temperature 21 degrees Celsius, dew point 13 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 29.77 inches-of-mercury.

The commercial pilot and two passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was consumed by post-crash fire. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated at Lancaster Airport (LNS), Lancaster, Pennsylvania about 1612, and was destined for Norwood Memorial Airport (OWD), Norwood, Massachusetts.  The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.Review of preliminary radar and voice communication data from the Federal Aviation Administration revealed that the flight was preparing to conduct an instrument approach procedure for landing at OWD. The flight was about 15 miles from OWD at an altitude of 3,300 feet mean sea level when the pilot declared an emergency to air traffic control, stating that the airplane was experiencing an \"engine problem.\" The pilot queried the controller about the nearest airport, and was given radar vectors. About 30 seconds later, the pilot advised that he was unable to maintain altitude, and subsequently stated, \"we got a real bad vibration we're losing engine.\" The controller advised that there was a highway to the right of the airplane's position and about 2.5 miles away, to which the pilot responded, \"we have no engine we're [in instrument meteorological conditions] I need help.\" The controller provided vectors toward the highway, which the pilot acknowledged. Shortly thereafter, the pilot stated, \"we're gliding.\" At this time, radar data showed the airplane at an altitude about 1,450 feet. The last recorded radar return, about 40 seconds later, showed the airplane in a right hand turn at an altitude of about 700 feet and groundspeed of 66 knots, about 1/10 mile from the accident site.Several witnesses reported hearing an airplane engine making noise and then stopping or going silent. They could not see the airplane due to the low cloud ceiling. One witness, who was located across the street from the accident site, described first hearing a \"low moan buzzing sound\" and when he looked up, observed the airplane over the trees at the rear of his property with its wings wagging back and forth. As it passed over his house, it was \"wobbling\" in a straight line. He then lost sight of it, and heard a \"boom\" seconds later. Another witness located adjacent to the accident scene described hearing what sounded like \"a broken fan\" before the airplane impacted the house.The airplane impacted the corner of the roof and the backyard deck of a residence, and came to rest upright, parallel to and about 15 feet from the rear wall of the home, oriented on heading of 320 degrees. The airplane and much of the residence were consumed by post-crash fire.Flight control continuity was established from the flight control surfaces to the cockpit area; the left rudder cable and the left aileron cable turnbuckle exhibited overload fractures. The right flap actuator was consistent with the right wing flap in the retracted position. The left flap actuator was consumed by fire. The landing gear and actuators were found in the extended position.  First responders reported detecting a strong odor of fuel when they arrived on scene.Preliminary examination of the engine revealed that the crankcase was breached over the #6 cylinder barrel. Two additional puncture holes were found in line with the #1 cylinder connecting rod, located between the left and right magnetos. The oil sump was fractured and partially melted away. Fragments consistent with bearing material, connecting rods, lifters and crankcase material were found in the oil sump and outside the engine crankcase.

In this condition, the engine responded to cockpit controls during an operational test run. Following the engine test run, the right fuel tank cap was loosened, and a \"whoosh\" sound was heard. Testing of the right fuel cap revealed a restriction to the flapper-valve assembly, which prevented air from passing freely through the vented cap as designed.

About 18 miles from its final destination, the airplane made several turns off its intended track, and it then resumed its track toward the airport while about 1,500 ft above ground level.

Radar contact was lost about 16 miles from the destination. No distress calls were heard from the pilot. The airplane wreckage was found in a pasture the following day. The airplane had impacted the ground in a near-vertical attitude.

Examination of the airframe components, flight controls, and the engine did not reveal any mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.Two residents in the vicinity of the accident site reported that they observed strong surface wind gusts and a drop in temperature about the time of the accident, and surface weather observation stations in the region of the convective activity reported surface wind gusts up to 30 mph about the time of the accident.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators traveled in support of this investigation and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot, who was also the station manager, arrived at the airport earlier than other company employees to prepare for a scheduled commuter flight, transporting seven passengers and cargo to another village during hours of arctic, predawn darkness.  Heavy frost was described on vehicles and airplanes the morning of the accident, and the lineman who serviced the airplane described a thin glaze of ice on the upper surface of the left wing.  The pilot was not observed deicing the airplane prior to flight, and was described by the other employees as in a hurry to depart on time.  The pilot directed the lineman to place fuel in the left wing only, which resulted in a fuel imbalance between 450 and 991 pounds (left wing heavy).  The first turn after takeoff was into the heavy left wing.  The airplane was observed climbing past the end of the runway, and descending vertically into the water.  No preimpact mechanical anomalies were found with the airplane or powerplant.  The aileron trim indicator was found in the full right wing down position. Postaccident flight tests with left wing heavy lateral fuel imbalances, disclosed that approximately one-half of right wing down aileron control deflection was used to maintain level flight, thus leaving only one-half right wing down aileron control efficacy.  Research has shown that frost on airfoils can result in reduced stall angles of attack (often below that required to activate stall warning devices), increases in stall speeds between 20% and 40%, asymmetric stalls resulting in large rolling moments, and differing stall angles of attack for wings with upward and downward deflected ailerons (as when recovering from turns). ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's disregard for lateral fuel loading limits, his improper removal of frost prior to takeoff, and the resulting inadvertent stall/spin.  Factors involved in this accident were the improper asymmetrical fuel loading which reduced lateral aircraft control, the self-induced pressure to takeoff on time by the pilot, and inadequate surveillance of the company operations by company management.

Metallurgical examination of the nose landing gear lower and upper drag braces, and lock brace, revealed no evidence of preexisting cracking, and that they failed due to overstress.  Examination and testing of the nose landing gear steering components did not reveal any pre-incident malfunctions.  The maintenance technician in the cockpit reported that he was \"riding the brakes\" at the time of the incident.  The airplane maintenance manual stated that at a minimum, applying airplane brakes while towing the airplane could shear the towbar shear pins; however, there was no visible evidence on the ground that the airplane's brakes had been applied during the tow.  After the incident, Boeing issued a service letter that discussed six previous reports of 737 nose landing gear collapse that occurred between 2004 to 2006 during pushback or towing.

A short time later, an undiscernible distress transmission was made over the frequency. A few seconds later, the airplane was observed spiraling to the ground. Global positioning system data recovered from the airplane revealed that it was traveling at an appropriate airspeed for entry into the downwind leg of the traffic pattern with a sufficient margin above the stall speed to maintain flight. It then made an abrupt left turn, resulting in a spiral dive, which progressed into a spin. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.No evidence of a bird-strike was found, and review of radar data did not reveal the presence of other aircraft in the vicinity just prior to the accident. However, radar data did reveal that the airplane passed through a cluster of primary targets (with no altitude information) at the time of the accident. Such primary targets could potentially be radar system anomalies, thermal air currents, or bird reflections. According to a bird mitigation specialist, large birds, or flocks of smaller birds, are often present at that time of year, and such birds typically fly circling patterns in thermal air currents at traffic pattern altitudes.The pilot\u2019s abrupt maneuver during the approach was consistent with an avoidance maneuver. The maneuver, which was calculated to be a 65-degree angle of bank to the left, most likely placed the airplane into an accelerated stall condition, which developed into a spin. The airplane was loaded toward its aft center of gravity limit, which could have increased its pitch sensitivity, thereby exacerbating the turn. A successful recovery from an unintentional stall-spin at pattern altitude is extremely unlikely.",

His work ended up lasting all day, and he did not depart until sundown. He stated that he was very tired and anxious to get home. His panel-mounted global positioning satellite system (GPS) was not internally lit, and after getting airborne he discovered that a flashlight that he kept in the airplane for this purpose did not work. Rather than return to the departure airport for another light, he decided to travel north until he intersected Interstate 84, where he could turn west and follow it home. He saw an intersection approaching, turned west, and gave no further thought to navigation.  He was 5,000 feet above ground level (agl) and stated that he could not be sure that this was the proper highway to follow. He noted that he was so tired that he forgot that he had a handheld GPS in his backpack that was internally lit. He noticed that the highway turned south, so he continued west thinking that he would pick it up again when it turned back to the north. About 30 minutes later, the pilot realized that he had been following the wrong road.  He became very disoriented and turned north attempting to locate a town that he could recognize. He then used his cell phone to light up the face of the panel-mounted GPS, discovered that he was 150 miles from Boise, Idaho, and turned toward it. About 10 minutes later, he realized that he did not have enough fuel to make it to Boise or even the next closest airport. He continued on toward Boise hoping that he would find a road or clear place to land. At an altitude of 4,000 feet agl, the engine lost power. He saw no traffic on any road to help find a landing spot. He was in an extremely remote area and only saw three lights on the ground that were about 1/2-mile apart. He landed on rough terrain near a house, and all three landing gear sheared off at touchdown.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion as a result of the pilot's becoming lost and disoriented.  Contributing to the accident was fatigue, as reported by the pilot."

The certificated flight instructor (CFI) was fatally injured, and the student pilot sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local instructional flight, which departed about 0940. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. In a statement to law enforcement, the student pilot recounted that he and the CFI were practicing emergency procedures following a simulated engine failure. The student pilot said that he entered an autorotation after the throttle was reduced to idle, and the helicopter was in an autorotational descent when the accident occurred. He could not completely recall the sequence of events leading up to the accident, but stated that as the helicopter descended through 100 feet, he remembered the CFI saying, \"we're going down.\" Another CFI, who was taxiing a helicopter with a student on the south side of LNA, reported hearing the accident helicopter transmit, \"we're going in the grass\" over the airport's common traffic advisory frequency. Shortly thereafter, an airplane in the airport traffic pattern reported that there was a helicopter down, and the CFI flew to the accident site to render assistance.  The helicopter came to rest on its left side in a grassy area about 700 feet northwest of the runway 15 threshold at LNA. The wreckage path was oriented approximately 140 degrees magnetic, and extended about 75 feet from the initial impact point to where the fuselage came to rest. The initial impact point was identified as a large metal stake, about 3 feet in height. The second point of impact was a small crater measuring about 4 feet long and 1 foot deep, located about 15 feet past the initial impact point. A portion of the forward skid crosstube was located in the crater. The vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer, and portion of the tail rotor came to rest next to the crater. The tail boom was separated from the fuselage, and fractured into several pieces, some of which displayed signatures consistent with main rotor blade contact. The skids separated from the fuselage and were fractured into several sections, which were located along the wreckage path. The fuselage exhibited downward crushing, and the cabin was fractured aft of the seat structures. Both the auxiliary and main fuel tanks were intact and contained fuel, and both fuel caps were secure. The fuel vent tubes were separated from the auxiliary tank by impact, which allowed fuel to drain from the tanks following the accident. The main rotor remained attached to the fuselage. One blade was bent up and displayed several chordwise creases along its span. The second blade was bent up about 45 degrees near its root. Neither blade displayed significant leading edge damage. The tail rotor drive shaft separated from the helicopter during the accident sequence, and a 5-foot portion was located about 500 feet west of the main wreckage. The aft portion of the tail rotor drive shaft was not recovered.The helicopter was removed from the accident site and transported to a salvage facility for further examination. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit area to the main rotor system. Tail rotor control continuity was established from the cockpit to the intermediate flex coupling. The main rotor gearbox rotated smoothly by hand with no anomalies observed. Examination of the v-belts, sheaves, and overrunning clutch also revealed no anomalies. Tail rotor drive continuity was established from the upper drive sheave to the intermediate flex coupling. The tail rotor gearbox rotated smoothly, with no anomalies noted. Power was applied to the engine starter, and utilizing the fuel onboard, the engine started, accelerated smoothly, and ran continuously for several minutes with no anomalies noted.",

He checked the fuel for the presence of water or debris, performed \"a simple alcohol test,\" and noted no problems.  The engine started \"perfectly,\" and he did not note any anomalies during the runup check.  At the beginning of the takeoff roll, the engine power was \"good,\" but once airborne, the engine began running \"unusually.\"  The pilot looked down at the tachometer and noticed that the rpm had decreased by 300.  He checked that the throttle and mixture controls were both in the forward position.  As the engine power continued to decrease, the pilot knew he could not turn the airplane back to the runway and would not clear the tops of the trees ahead, so he flew toward a gap in the trees.  He attempted to keep the airplane flying as long as he could, but ultimately it entered a \"controlled stall,\" and descended into a power line.  The airplane then impacted the ground, erupted in flames, and was consumed by a postimpact fire.  Examination of the remaining portions of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical deficiencies.  A sample of fuel from the container used to service the airplane was examined, and found absent of debris or water.",

The pilot further reported that the engine subsequently lost total power when the airplane was about 150 ft above ground level. The airplane then impacted water in a nose-down, right-wing-low attitude about 300 ft from the end of the runway.The pilot reported that he thought that the runway was 1,900 ft long; however, it was only 1,300 ft long. Review of the takeoff ground roll distance charts contained in the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook (POH) revealed that, with flap settings of 0 and 20 degrees, the ground roll would have been 1,700 and 1,150 ft, respectively. Takeoff ground roll distances were not provided for use of 10 degrees of flaps; however, the POH stated that 10 degrees of flaps could be used. Although the distance was not specified, it is likely that the airplane would have required more than 1,300 ft for takeoff with 10 degrees of flaps.Examination of the engine revealed saltwater corrosion throughout it; however, this was likely due to the airplane\u2019s submersion in water after the accident. No other mechanical malfunctions or abnormalities were noted. Examination of data extracted from the multifunction display (MFD) and primary flight display (PFD) revealed that the engine parameters were performing in the normal operating range until the end of the recordings. The data also indicated that,\u00a07 seconds before the end of the recordings, the airplane\u00a0pitched up from 0 to about 17 degrees and then rolled 17 degrees\u00a0left wing down\u00a0while continuing to pitch up to 20 degrees. The airplane then rolled 77 degrees right wing down and pitched down about 50 degrees.\u00a0The highest airspeed recorded by the MFD and PFD was about 70 knots, which occurred about 1 second before the end of the recordings. The POH stated that, depending on the landing gear position, flap setting, and bank angle, the stall speed for the airplane would be between 65 and 71 knots. Based on the evidence, it is likely that the engine did not lose power as reported by the pilot.

The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and a instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight. The flight departed from Burlington-Alamance Regional Airport (BUY), Burlington, North Carolina at 0553, and was destined for Morristown Municipal Airport (MMU), Morristown, New Jersey. The business flight transporting medical specimens was operated by LabCorp, Inc. under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.Review of preliminary air traffic control radar and communication data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Greensboro Approach Control, revealed that the airplane departed from runway 06 at BUY and made initial contact while climbing to the assigned altitude of 3,000 feet mean sea level. The pilot was told to reset his transponder and no further communications were received from the accident flight. According to FAA records, the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with multiple ratings, including airplane single-engine land, as well as a flight instructor certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on November 19, 2012, at which time he reported 6,279 total hours of flight experience. The accident site was located in a park approximately 5 miles northeast of BUY. The initial impact location was identified by a ground impression with various parts of the right wing and also a crater that measured about 3 feet deep. The wreckage debris field was 793 foot-long and 298 foot-wide, oriented on a 140 degree heading. Various sizes of wing spar segments, the propeller hub, two propeller blades, and the front reduction gear box were located in the crater. The engine was located about 100 feet from the impact point. Fragments of the airplane, including a section of the cabin area, empennage, left and right wings, and cockpit were located along the wreckage path. The two other propeller blades were located about 200 and 400 feet from the impact point, and exhibited some S-bending damage. All major flight control surfaces and associated counter weights were located in the debris field. The 0554 recorded weather observation at BUY, included wind from 040 degrees at 4 knots, visibility 10 miles, broken clouds at 700 feet above ground level (agl), overcast at 1,700 agl, temperature 4 degrees C, dew point 3 degrees C; barometric altimeter 30.02 inches of mercury.",

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight, conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to an employee who worked at a restaurant located on the south side of 7NK4, at approximately 1200 while looking out of a north facing window, he first observed the tailwheel equipped airplane doing touch and go landings on runway 18.At approximately 1245 the restaurant employee looked out the window once again and this time observed that the airplane was upside down next to the east side of runway 18, and called 911. Examination of the area surrounding the accident site revealed that a business located on the south side 7NK4 had security camera system installed on the premises.

After doing the predetermined maneuvers, which included four simulated approaches to landing, he descended to traffic pattern altitude.  As he maneuvered onto the base leg, he reduced the engine power from about 4,500 rpm to 2,000 rpm.  The airplane began to lose a significant amount of altitude, and in response, the pilot moved the throttle control forward.  The engine then had a total loss of power.  The airplane descended and impacted the roof of a private residence.  Examination of the airplane and engine following the accident revealed the upper spark plugs were all a similar black coloration, indicating that the fuel/air mixture was rich.  Additional evidence of a rich mixture was found with dark black residue lining the tail pipe exhaust.  After starting the engine during a postaccident examination, the throttle control was manipulated and the engine responded appropriately. The engine emitted a thick white smoke during operation.  Investigators noted that when retarding the throttle toward the idle position, the throttle arms did not move against the idle adjustment screw stops.  Manual manipulation of both throttle arms to the carburetors' adjustment screws resulted in a loss of power.  The same action was repeated four times, producing the same results.

The flight diverted to an alternate airport where it landed without further incident.  Examination of the engine revealed an uncontained separation of an approximately 180-degree arc of the second stage turbine disk rim.  The missing section of the rim coincided with circumferential rub marks on the second stage turbine disk that corresponded to rub marks on the rear inner rails of the second stage turbine vanes.  The rubbed areas of the disk and vanes did not exhibit heat cracking consistent with a relatively long time period of rubbing relative to a sudden disk-to-vane contact.  The fan rotor bearing did not exhibit rotational distress.  The engine did not exhibit any evidence of a blade separation, case rupture, or any other uncontainment.  The second stage retaining bolts are coated with a baked-on antiseize compound, FelPro C-200, during manufacture.  Metallurgical exam of the second stage turbine bolts revealed cracking in the head-to-shank fillet radius and the presence of silver consistent with Silver Goop.  Silver Goop is an anti-seize compound not authorized by the engine manufacturer for use in the high-pressure turbine area but is authorized in the low-pressure compressor area due to the catalytic properties of silver with wet FelPro C-200 resulting in a corrosive mixture that can contribute to bolt fractures.  The induced loads from the second stage disk rim separation were estimated to have been 3.6 - 6.6 times greater than to those induced by a fan blade separation.  The accident operator purchased an engine as-is and that according to maintenance records was not preserved when it was removed from an airplane belonging to another operator about 5 years prior to the accident.

The pilot was one of 12 pilots delivering new helicopters to various destinations, all of which required a departure along the same easterly route, through a mountain pass, and then over high desert terrain that included another line of mountains.  The planned route of flight followed a major highway and would take about 2.6 hours to complete.  Prior to the accident pilot's departure he was observed to be anxious and was heard to say that he had to get to his destination by 1600.  After weather delays at the departure airport, the pilot took off at 1425 as the last helicopter of a group of four helicopters spaced about 15 minutes apart.  While en route other pilots in the group observed rain and lighting to the northeast of their track once they were east of the mountain pass and elected to follow the major highway and remain clear of the observed weather.  Analysis of the meteorological data discloses that the weather conditions in the area to the northeast of the planned flight track (including the accident site location) consisted of light to moderate rain, clouds obscuring higher terrain, restricted visibilities, and possible light to moderate turbulence.  Once through the mountain pass the accident pilot radioed a passing airplane that he was heading to the northeast, which is consistent with a straight-line course to his destination.  The helicopter was equipped with a GPS navigation system, which had the capability to guide the pilot on a straight-line course to his destination, which could save about 17 minutes of flying time.  Based on the evidence, the pilot followed the GPS direct course, and encountered restricted visibility, rain, and moderate turbulence.  He unintentionally flew up into a box canyon and collided with rising terrain while attempting to reverse course out of the canyon.  Detailed examination of the helicopter and engine revealed no preimpact discrepancies that would have precluded normal operation of the aircraft.",
