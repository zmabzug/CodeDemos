The pilot dropped the log load and autorotated into a small, upsloping, cleared area within the surrounding wooded terrain landing hard. Postcrash examination of the engine revealed that the centrifugal impeller had separated due to fatigue cracking in one of the drain holes. An Airworthiness Directive (AD) had been issued relative to the -08 impeller but did not include the -07 impeller (installed in the accident engine). The -07 and -08 impellers are essentially identical with the exception that the -07 impeller is found on military variants of the engine whereas the -08 is found only on civilian variants. As the -07 impeller was not included in the AD, the operator was not required to conduct the appropriate inspections described in the mandated service bulletin. Additionally, the AD did not require a cycle count for the impeller as addressed in the service bulletin, thus rendering the service bulletin unusable even if it had been mandated for the -07 impeller.

He then flew about 1.5 hours and landed at an airport.  When he departed from that airport to fly back to the origination point, he did not visually check the fuel prior to the flight.  During the return flight he noticed that the fuel quantity gauge for the left fuel tank was \"dropping at an excessive rate.\"  As a precaution, he diverted to a nearby airport.  At approximately 4,000 feet, both engines sputtered and subsequently lost power within a few seconds of each other.  Realizing he could not make the airport, the pilot performed an off field landing into trees.  At the time of the power loss, he remembered the right tank was indicating about 20 gallons, and the left tank was indicating about 10 gallons.  No fire, defoliation of vegetation, or a significant amount of liquid fuel was noted at the accident site; however, a small amount of residual fuel, and an odor of fuel was noted.  Due to the compromised fuel system that resulted from impact forces, the presence of fuel on board at the time of the accident could not be positively ascertained.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunction with the engines, fuel strainers, or fuel selector valves.  The right fuel selector valve was found between the OFF and X-FEED positions.  The left fuel selector valve was found half way between the OFF and LEFT position; however, impact damage could have altered the position of the valves.

After losing sight of the runway once and going around, they continued the approach, even though the pilot in command (PIC) stated that he thought they were going to land long. The  PIC stated that the main landing gear touched down near the 1,000-foot marker of the 4,801-foot-long runway, about the landing reference speed (Vref) of 120 knots. The PIC stated that he then applied the brakes but thought they were not working; he had not yet activated the thrust reversers. He alerted the second in command (SIC), who also depressed the brake pedals with no apparent results. The PIC suggested a go-around, but the SIC responded that it was too late. The airplane subsequently traveled off the end of the runway, struck a gravel berm, and came to rest about 816 feet beyond the end of the runway. During the impact, one of the passenger seats dislodged from its seat track and was found on the cabin floor, with the passenger still in it. Review of cockpit voice recorder, video, and performance data revealed that the main landing gear touched down at Vref and about 1,650 feet beyond the approach end of the runway. The nosegear then touched down 2.4 seconds later and about 2,120 feet beyond the approach end of the runway, with about 2,680 feet of runway remaining. Digital electronic engine control data revealed that about 8 seconds after weight-on-wheels, the power levers were advanced from the idle position to the takeoff position. The power levers were then returned to the idle position 6 seconds later. The power levers were moved to the reverse thrust position 8 seconds after that and remained in that position for the duration of the accident sequence; both thrust reversers deployed when commanded. Examination and testing of the airplane systems did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the wheels brakes or any other systems.Although armed, the airbrakes did not deploy upon touchdown; the data available was inconclusive to determine what position the throttles were in at touchdown and why the airbrakes did not deploy. It is likely that the pilots did not detect the wheel braking because its effect was less than expected with the airplane at full power and with the airbrakes stowed.Landing distance data revealed that the airplane required about 2,551 feet to stop at its given weight in the given weather conditions. With a runway distance of 2,680 feet remaining, the airplane could have stopped or gone around uneventfully with appropriate use of all deceleration devices. The landing procedure stated to activate the thrust reversers after nosewheel touchdown and then apply the brakes, as necessary; however, the PIC only applied the brakes. Further, no callouts were made to verify ground spoiler or reverse thrust deployment. The PIC then stated that he was going to go around, but the SIC said it was too late, so the thrust levers were brought back to idle and the reversers were deployed. The PIC's delayed decision to stop or go around resulted in about a 22-second delay in thrust reverser activation, which resulted in the runway overrun. Additionally, the procedure for a (perceived) failed brake system would have been to activate the emergency brake, which neither pilot did.Examination of the seats revealed that a forward-facing seat was installed in the aft-facing position and an aft-facing seat was installed in the forward-facing position. Additionally, the ejected seat's shear plungers were found in the raised position. Had the seat been installed correctly, the plungers would have been in the lowered position, in the seat track. The improper installation most likely resulted in the passenger\u2019s seat separating from the seat track and exacerbating his injuries.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot in command's failure to follow the normal landing procedures (placing engines into reverse thrust first and then brake), his delayed decision to continue the landing or go-around, and the flight crew's failure to follow emergency procedures once a perceived loss of brakes occurred. Contributing to the seriousness of the passenger's injury was the improper securing of the passenger seat by maintenance personnel."

The flight crew stated that the airplane rolled off to the right about 11 knots above the expected stick shaker speed.  The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that \"as the airplane slowed through [approximately] 126 knots [indicated airspeed], it abruptly rolled off / dropped the right wing and the nose fell rapidly.\"  He noted that, although the autopilot was on as required by the test procedure, he was holding the control wheel and felt \"no vibration or abnormal indication\" prior to the event.  He reported that the airplane rolled 5 to 7 times, both to the right and the left.  The second-in-command (SIC) stated that the right wing dropped and characterized it as a steady roll to the right, not a violent roll.  He commented that the wing dropped \"as though it was a root stall.\"  He reported that he moved to push forward on the controls in order to unload the wing; however, the PIC instructed him to stay off the controls.  He stated that the PIC did not unload the wing and the aircraft kept rolling.  The aircraft subsequently rolled several times before it was recovered to controlled flight.  The flight crew executed a no-flap landing without further incident.  The SIC pilot reported that one of the mechanics had come forward during the flight and informed him some frost was present on the wings near the root.  However, the SIC reported he did not observe any ice form on the aircraft nor did he observe the icing advisory light during the flight.  Outside air temperatures were not below freezing.  He added that from the pilot's seat approximately the outboard one-half of the wings are visible.  In his post incident statement, one of the mechanics on the flight reported that a small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings during the initial tests, prior to the stall.  He subsequently noticed that the ice was dissipating.  He thought that this was due to warmer temperatures or the aircraft deice system.  Post incident inspection of the airframe did not reveal any anomalies consistent with a premature stall and loss of control.  Subsequent flight testing did not reveal any adverse stall characteristics.  The Airplane Flight Manual required that all external airframe surfaces must be free of ice when performing intentional stalls.",

The accident flight was the first flight of the day.  The pilot utilized a 50-foot-long line and a net to transfer 15 fuel cans down to the canyon floor.  The pilot said that when he picked up the load at the top of the canyon (elevation 4,800 feet msl) he performed a power check and the torque required was 75 percent for an out of ground effect hover.  After stabilizing the load he began a descent to the canyon floor below (at an elevation of 1,300 feet msl) and was at a descent rate of about 50 feet per minute as he neared the ground.  The wind conditions were reported by witnesses and the pilot as being calm, or nearly so.  His head was outside the cockpit watching the ground crew, when he heard a tone, and then heard a series of three low frequency popping noises.  The pilot said he was unsure if the popping sounds were coming from the engine or from the main rotor blades  The helicopter then began to settle toward the ground and descended to a hard impact into desert scrub brush.

As per the lesson profile, the student planned a dual cross country flight, but while en route, the instructor told the student to divert to another field. After arrival at the field, they over-flew the runway and determined that there was a direct crosswind at what they estimated was about 10 knots. The student then entered a left pattern for a full-stop landing on the damp turf runway. During his first two approaches, the student allowed the aircraft to get too high on final, and in both instances a go-around was initiated. On the third approach the aircraft remained on the proper final approach path until it was approximately 50 feet above the ground. At that point the aircraft encountered a wind gust, and it ballooned upward to an extent that the pilot was not able to descend to a position where he felt comfortable initiating the landing flare until the aircraft was almost halfway down the 2,600 foot runway. Then the aircraft \"floated for awhile in ground effect\" before touching down approximately two-thirds of the way down the runway. During this sequence of events, the student did not attempt to initiate a go-around on his own, and the instructor did not direct him to do one. After the aircraft touched down, the student applied the wheel brakes while holding the yoke full back for aerodynamic braking. Then the instructor came on the controls and assisted with the braking effort. Ultimately the pilots were unable to get the aircraft stopped before it went off the end of the runway, down a steep embankment, and into a ditch. Upon impacting the ditch, the nose wheel folded back and the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The investigation did not find any evidence of problems with the aircraft's flight control or wheel braking systems.",

Prior to the accident flight, the airplane underwent maintenance for two outstanding service bulletins.  During compliance with one of the service bulletins, the left aileron would have been removed and reinstalled.  The pilot confirmed with the service center personnel that the maintenance on the airplane was completed and then proceeded to preflight the airplane.  After departure, the airplane was level at 2,000 feet mean sea level (msl) for approximately one minute, the pilot noticed that the airplane began \"pulling\" to the left, and the left aileron was separated at one hinge attach point.  The pilot then flew the airplane toward an unpopulated area, shutdown the engine, and deployed the aircraft's ballistic parachute system.  Subsequently, the airplane descended to the ground with the aid of the parachute canopy and came to rest upright in a field of mesquite trees.  Examination of the left aileron and the airframe aileron hinges revealed that the outboard aileron hinge bolt was missing, and no evidence of safety wire noted.  According to maintenance manual procedures, the bolt and washer hardware were to be torqued to a measured 20-25 inch pounds, then safety wired to a actuation fitting.  After installation, the manual required a verification of proper hinge bolt installation and torque on the outboard hinge.",

While on a northerly approach to the runway, during dark night conditions, the CFI said he inadvertently allowed the student pilot to descend too steeply, and with a high airspeed.  His verbal command for the student to stop the excessive descent and slow the airspeed was initially followed, but the student pilot again allowed the airplane to attain a rapid descent rate and high airspeed as the approach continued. The CFI took control of the airplane, added full engine power, and initiated a go-around.  During the attempted go-around, the CFI said he encountered severe windshear.  He wrote, in part: \"I felt the aircraft had gotten into a severe vertical windshear, and no amount of power we had available was stopping the rate of descent, and we hit the ground.\" The airplane collided with a stand of trees and came to rest inverted, about 300 yards short of the approach end of the runway, sustaining substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.  At the time of the accident wind conditions were reported to be 350 degrees (true) at 9 knots. An FAA airworthiness inspector reported that during his postaccident inspection of the airplane, no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane were discovered. Due to the absence of any mechanical problems with the airplane, the dark night conditions, and the relatively light winds reported at the time of the accident, it is probable that the accident could have been prevented if the CFI had provided better supervision of the student and initiated a go-around sooner.

During the descent, with the propeller windmilling, the aircraft shook so violently that it was very difficult for the pilot to see, and he became concerned that the engine might separate from the airframe. When the aircraft reached the ground, the pilot tried to land on a narrow road, but with his visibility still significantly effected by the vibration of the airframe, he was unable to keep the One Design within the lateral confines of the road.

None of these individuals was experiencing any personal problems or rest anomalies that would have affected their performance. The airplanes had undergone the required inspections.  Examination of their maintenance documents revealed that both airplanes complied with all appropriate airworthiness directives.  Evidence gathered from the wreckage indicated that neither airplane had experienced an in-flight fire, bird strike, or structural or mechanical failure. Tissue samples revealed that the pilot of the Seminole had taken doxylamine sometime before the accident.

No stereo photographs from a Seminole cockpit were available to determine precise obstruction angles.  However, because of the relative viewing angle, the Chieftain would have been visible to the pilots in the Seminole for most of the last 60 seconds.  The study further revealed that about 4 seconds before impact, or about .11 nm separation, the angular width of each airplane in each pilot's field of vision would have been approximately 0.5 to 0.6 degrees or about 1/4 inch apparent size at the windscreen.

The airplane, which was owned by a private individual, was operated by Hawkeye Aviation Holdings Ltd, Kelowna, British Columbia. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the planned cross-country flight, which was being operated in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. An instrument flight rules flight plan was in effect at the time of the event, with Springbank, British Columbia, the reported destination.In a telephone interview with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, the pilot reported that on takeoff roll the airplane reacted normally. However, on rotation he experienced a severe yaw to the right, which was accompanied by a significant roll to the right. The pilot stated that he then added left aileron and depressed left rudder pedal to counter the yaw; however, the left rudder input was not effective. The pilot opined that passing through 10,000 feet mean sea level, and with the cross-control condition not having been resolved, he contacted air traffic control and requested a return to the departure airport; the controller approved the request. The pilot reported that while on descent and continuing through landing, he was forced to use cross-control inputs, left aileron and left rudder inputs, as the right yaw condition persisted; he added that the left rudder input still had no effect on countering the right yaw. The pilot stated that after touching down and during the landing roll, he used differential power to maintain his track on the runway.

Witnesses reported observing the airplane pass directly over their work site at a very low altitude about 1 mile south of the airport.

The last two returns show an altitude of 900 feet msl and a slight change of direction back toward the south. The last radar return was located about 0.5 miles north of the accident site. The departure clearance dictated that the pilot was to continue straight on the runway heading of 180 degrees until intercepting a VOR radial about 6 miles from the airport. Thereafter, he was to make a left turn to join the radial and follow it to the first intersection on the departure route (about 10.25 miles south of the airport).

The private pilot and a passenger were fatally injured and one passenger was seriously injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the planned flight to PIE. The flight departed John C Tune Airport (JWN), Nashville, Tennessee about 2338 eastern daylight time on March 21, 2014. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. According to preliminary information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the airplane was in radio and radar contact with air traffic control (ATC) as it approached PIE. The pilot subsequently reported a fuel emergency and the airplane impacted powerlines about 6 miles north of PIE. The wreckage came to rest upright, nose-down, oriented on a southeasterly heading, on a highway beneath the powerlines. All major components of the airplane were accounted for at the scene. The engine and cockpit area were crushed inward and the cabin roof had separated. The cabin roof, where the top of the cockpit door met the cabin, exhibited an impact mark consistent with a wire strike. The impact mark was a similar size to an approximate 1.25-inch-thick aluminum powerline that had separated during the impact, causing a power outage in the area. The aluminum power line had been located about 160 feet above the highway. The leading edge of the left wing exhibited impact damage. The left main fuel tank remained intact and approximately 4 ounces of fuel were recovered from it by an FAA inspector. The left aileron and flap remained attached. The right wing was undamaged with the exception of a partial separation of the right flap and the right fuel tank was compromised at its fuel drain. During recovery, the FAA inspector observed some drops of fuel dripping from the right tank. The fuel selector was found positioned to the left main fuel tank. The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on October 31, 2013. At that time, he reported a total flight experience of 1,549 hours. A handheld Garmin 496 GPS was recovered from the wreckage and retained for further examination.",

The local solo instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot, she landed the helicopter after a 40-minute flight and started the shut-down procedures. She applied the collective friction and started the timer, running the engine at 2,500 rpm for a cool down period. She turned off the boost pump and radios, and pulled out the checklist to ensure she had completed the proper items. She then engaged the collective friction and was tightening the cyclic friction at the cyclic base when the helicopter developed ground resonance. The pilot couldn't get the helicopter airborne with the frictions engaged, so she rolled the throttle to idle. The resonance continued to increase, and \"in a matter of seconds, the helicopter shook itself apart.\" The pilot could only hold on until the movement stopped, at which time, she secured the engine then subsequently climbed out of the helicopter.",

He primed it, left the parking brake on, set the throttle to idle, turned the master switch and magneto switches on, and spun the propeller. The engine started but did not remain running. He started it again by hand propping. He advanced the throttle to keep it running, but again it did not remain running. He applied carburetor heat, but did not reduce the throttle setting. He hand-propped the engine once again and it went to a high rpm setting, and then the airplane began moving forward. The pilot reached in to try to retard the throttle, but was unsuccessful.

After closing the throttle and lowering the collective, the helicopter began to shudder and turned 45 degrees to the left before the ground resonance condition subsided.  The pilot was successful in his attempt to pick the helicopter up again to a hover, stabilizing engine RPM, coming to a stable hover, and sustaining rotor RPM during a left pedal turn.  While attempting forward flight from this position the helicopter's RPM dipped again, resulting in the pilot having to set the helicopter down again.  The aircraft entered  ground resonance a second time,  this time worse than the first, resulting in the helicopter being shook apart around the pilot and his passenger.  Post-accident tests indicated that all four landing gear dampers, having failed a load stroke test, were set too hard, resulting in a ground resonance condition being encountered after a landing due to reduced rotor RPM.",

On the day of the accident, after two aerial application flights, he returned to his airport to replenish the application chemical for a third trip to the same agricultural field. About 30 minutes later, a witness heard the engine \"sputter\" during a spray run, and observed the airplane begin a climbing right turn back towards the airport. The engine stopped and restarted, and the airplane began another climb in the direction of the airport. The engine stopped a second time, and two witnesses saw the airplane descend without engine power into a wooded area. The airplane was substantially damaged, and the pilot was fatally injured. Autopsy results indicated that the pilot had diabetes, coronary artery disease, an enlarged heart, and gallstones. In addition, he was taking a medication commonly prescribed for neurological pain, and another for smoking cessation, both of which had the potential to cause distraction or impairment. It was not clear what role, if any, the medical conditions or medications played in the accident. He did not note any medications or medical conditions on his most recent application for medical certificate, but it is possible that the medications were initially prescribed since that application. At the time of the accident, the airplane and engine had accumulated approximately 89 hours since new. The pilot had previously experienced engine stoppage problems, and had conducted at least one forced landing due to an engine stoppage. Subsequent to that forced landing, and in the weeks just prior the accident, the pilot installed an electric fuel pump, which was in addition to the existing engine-driven fuel pump. Post-accident examination of the airplane indicated that the engine fuel system was not configured or equipped in accordance with the engine manufacturer's published guidance. Differences included fuel lines that were not thermally shrouded, lack of a fuel pump bypass circuit, lack of a fuel return line, and pump output pressure which exceeded the engine manufacturer's limits.

The private pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot. No flight plan was filed for the flight that was destined for Hampton Airport (7B3) Hampton, New Hampshire. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. A witness stated that she heard the airplane on the takeoff roll and turned around to watch it depart. When she saw the airplane it was just starting to climb toward the south and the engine was \"spitting and sputtering.\" The witness said the airplane started a right turn toward her but felt that the pilot saw her standing there so he banked to the left.  The pilot then pulled up to avoid hitting a house, entered a right turn and descended into a field. The witness said that as the airplane climbed over the house, there was a quick surge in engine power before it made a \"pop, pop\" sound followed by a total loss of power. She said the pilot was flying the airplane the entire time, but was \"in trouble\" from the time he took-off up until the impact. The airplane came to rest upright in a field on a heading of 266 degrees a few hundred yards southwest of the runway. From the point of impact to where the airplane came to rest was about 40 feet.

One witness reported hearing the engine overspeed after the landing gear were raised, but that the overspeed was momentary.  Another witness observed the airplane in a very steep bank, approximately 80 degrees.  He reported the angle of bank was reduced to about 30 degrees prior to ground impact.  The passenger who was in the right rear seat of the accident airplane reported that during take-off the engine started \"missing.\"  He reported the pilot stated, \"This isn't right,\" and reached to adjust something and soon after the engine smoothed out.  The pilot made a radio call (which the witness could not hear) and banked the airplane to the left.  He reported the nose and left wing dropped and the airplane's left wing impacted the ground with about a 30 degree angle of bank.  The nose of the airplane hit the ground and the airplane spun around, but did not cartwheel, before it came to a stop.  The witness reported that he thought the airplane's engine was no longer missing, but was operating normally when the airplane impacted the ground.  The airplane wreckage was located in a harvested cornfield about 600 feet east of runway 18.  The approximately 65 foot wreckage path was on a heading of about 030 degrees magnetic.

The propeller slash was about 51 inches in length measured at ground level, and it measured about 18 inches deep from ground level to the bottom of the slash mark.  The north side of the ground slash had been polished smooth and exhibited a gray color on the slash's surface similar to the paint found on the propeller blades.  Inspection of the flight controls revealed continuity between all flight controls and their respective control surfaces.  Inspection of the engine revealed it rotated and had thumb compression and suction on all cylinders.  The propeller blades had rotational scoring of the paint on camber side of the blades, but no twisting or deformation of the tips.  The propeller governor's pressure relief valve spring was found broken as a result of a fatigue fracture.  A functional test of the propeller governor revealed that the pressure relief setting and the pump capacity were well below specified minimums.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.On the dark early morning departure from Dallas Love Field, the pilot rated passenger was occupying the left seat. During climb out the pilot-in-command realized there was some kind of problem because they were not gaining any altitude, so he 'applied 1/4 flaps to try and gain some altitude.'  The airspeed at that time was about 105 knots.  He then retracted the flaps because his airspeed had deteriorated to about 90 knots and the aircraft was not gaining altitude.  'Both engines appeared to be developing power, RPM 2,300 Manifold Pressure 26 inches with fuel flow, however he thought the right engine acted as if it were operating only on one mag.' The pilot rated passenger did not notice any problems with the engines until after the airplane struck the first power line and then the right engine began making sounds like it was 'cutting out.'  Examination of the aircraft wreckage revealed that both main landing gear were down and the nose landing gear was within the aircraft's crushed nose.  The right main landing gear up lock was fractured.  The landing gear control lever was found half way between the up and down position, the flap control lever was in the full down position, and the throttle, propeller and mixture control levers were full forward.  Examination of the flap actuator revealed it to be fully extended and the exposed actuating rod was measured at 3 inches. According to the aircraft manufacturer, this would equate to the flaps being fully extended.  Examination of the right engine revealed the right magneto's ignition lead cover plate was separated from the magneto.  The magneto on the right engine was changed by the pilot the day prior at Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Cracks were found in cylinders #1 and #4 of the right engine in the vicinity of their intake ports.  The cracks were 2 inches in length with black deposits.  It appeared that the intake ports had been modified.  Performance data indicates the airplane's single engine rate-of-climb was approximately 289 feet per minute with an indicated airspeed of 108 miles per hour.  To attain this rate of climb the aircraft's flight manual states that you must 'use maximum continuous power on operating engine (full throttle, 2,575 RPM) leaned to best power fuel flow, cowl flaps as required to control engine temperature within limits, landing gear up, flaps up.  Inoperative engine feathered, cowl flaps closed.  Climb at best rate of climb speed.' ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command's failure to follow emergency procedures to reduce drag and maintain best climb airspeed.  Factors were the partial loss of engine power due to the cracks in the #1 and #4 cylinders as the result of an unapproved modification of their intake ports, the separation of the magneto lead plate due to its improper installation by the pilot-in-command, the dark night light conditions and the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

Immediately after descending out of the clouds, witnesses reported that the engine began to 'sputter,' then quit. They observed the airplane impact level terrain during a rapid rate of descent. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the vernier mixture control was found in the idle cutoff position, and the throttle was found in a cruise power position.

He immediately looked up and saw damage on the left wing with black smoke coming out of a hole in the wing. The pilot stopped the airplane, exited and put out the fire with an onboard fire extinguisher. Examination of the airplane found a thermally damaged hose (vent line), which contained a tight hose clamp and crimped end within the clamp. The separated hose was found lying below the siphon break-bent line interconnect. The position of the clamped and crimped end was consistent with the hose being clamped prior to the break-bent line, which would have allowed the partially connected hose to separate from the break-bent line. The separation of the hose from the break-bent line interconnect would have allowed fuel vapor to accumulate within the wing's open cavities. Additionally, the landing light power wire was separated and the exposed end of the wire exhibited melting, and there was evidence of arcing that existed along the base of the structure (lighting hole) and adjacent interior upper wing skin. This arcing was likely the ignition source for the trapped fuel vapor. The outboard leading edge fuel cell was removed during the investigation and checked for leaks. The fuel cell was pressurized and an air leak was found on the aft side of the fuel cap assembly, at the interior fuel placard mounting rivets. The fuel full placard and rivets were found to be loose when moved by hand. The loose mounting rivets would have also been a source of fuel vapor, which would have contributed to the fuel vapors trapped in the wing. The left wing fuel cells were replaced about 13 months prior to the accident and the airplane's most recent 100-hour inspection was performed about 3 months prior to the accident. For 100-hour inspections, the airplane's maintenance manual contained instructions to examine fuel cells, vent lines, and electrical wiring.",

Under the procedure, the ground handler will walk around the airplane just before the pushback to ensure that the airplane's path is clear.  Once the flight crew gives the clearance, the pushback commences without the aid of wing walkers or other safety observers.  The handler assigned to this flight did his walk around after the jetway bridge had been moved back.  Once he was cleared by the flight crew he leaned over the tow bar for one last look and then mounted the tractor to start the push.  He did not see the lavatory service truck at any time and the lavatory driver did not verbally communicate his presence or intentions.  The flight crew turned on the rotating beacon just before the aircraft started to move.

The helicopter was under contract to the U.S. Forest Service and was assigned to Krassel Helibase (24K), Idaho.  The pilot was requested to fly a relief Fire Lookout to a lookout tower on Williams Peak, which was 4 nautical miles (nm) and a 2,844 feet elevation gain away.  There were several forest fires in the area and visibility in the lower valley was approximately 1 nm.  The relief Fire Lookout, who was dropped off, said that as the helicopter flew up the ridge, visibility got much better.  He said that there were two forest service personnel on board, to assist in off-loading and on-loading equipment, supplies, and refuse from the two open-top external cargo baskets that were secured to the helicopter's skid gear.  Cargo was secured in the cargo baskets by multiple bungee cords.  The return flight would have been flown directly into the late afternoon sun.  There were no witnesses to the accident.  Thirteen cubitainers (5 gallon plastic containers for potable water), two large plastic refuse bags, yellow crepe paper and several chips of green helicopter paint were found near a freshly downed and up rooted snag (a dead, defoliated conifer) located on the ridgetop.  The snag was estimated to have been 90 feet tall.  Further down the mountain side was a tail rotor paddle which had separated at its cuff.  The burned out wreckage of the helicopter was found on a forest service road, approximately 2,000 feet down the mountain and 1,230 foot elevation loss from the initial downed snag.  Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the power turbine's blades were sheared from their disc, which indicated an over speed event.  This would occur with a main rotor blade strike/sudden-stoppage event, and the subsequent compromised engine to main rotor power train.  Additionally, 11 of the containers that had been in one cargo basket had 3 to 9 inch slashes in them from the tail rotor.  Interviews were conducted by U.S. Forest Service personnel with four Helitack crew members who were assigned to the helicopter. They said the pilot did like to do \"showy\" flying at times, but would always ask the passengers if they were comfortable.  He would \"buzz\" a ridge every now and then, and perform a maneuver he called the \"sleigh ride.\"  One of the Helitack crew members said that a \"sleigh ride was where you top a ridge then drop the collective, drop the nose a bit....it was a common maneuver for him.\"  No preimpact engine or airframe anomalies, which might have affected the helicopter\u2019s performance, were identified.

In addition, he checked the automated report for the nearest airplane weather facility, which reported wind from the north at 4 knots. The pilot departed the private strip, a 2,600 foot-long turf and asphalt runway, to the south toward a river. While on the takeoff roll, with a tailwind, the pilot rotated the airplane for takeoff at the usual rotation point. The airplane climbed to about 3 feet then settled back to the runway. With a quarter of the runway remaining, the pilot continued the takeoff, increased flaps, and verified that the throttle and propeller controls were full forward. The pilot again rotated the airplane and was able to climb about 4 feet when the airplane again settled back to the ground. The pilot then dumped the application load and tried to maintain control of the airplane. The airplane continued a short distance to the opposite river bank, impacted terrain, and slid on its belly. The pilot reported that during the preflight checks the airplane had adequate oil and the fuel was sumped of any water. In addition, the pilot reported normal engine instrumentation prior to the takeoff roll.",

About 41 seconds later, the ground controller cleared the CL-600-2C10 to push back onto taxiway alpha from gate 79.
