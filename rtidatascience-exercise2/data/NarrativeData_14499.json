Before attempting to land at the non-towered airport, the pilot overflew runway 21 before making a left turn and entering a left downwind for runway 21. A witness reported seeing the airplane while on final approach just east of the airport about 300 to 400 feet above ground level (agl), \u201c...and everything looked normal,\u201d but as the airplane got closer he observed some \u201cwing rock,\u201d similar to a small Dutch Roll. Shortly thereafter, when the airplane was about 100 to 150 feet agl, its left wing dipped a little, followed by the right wing dropping very fast, which was then followed by a spin to the right and subsequent impact with terrain. A postimpact fire subsequently erupted, which consumed the forward section of the airplane. The wind was reported to be 350 degrees at 14 knots, with gusts to 24 knots, about the time of the accident. A wind of such direction and velocity would have likely resulted in a significant tailwind for the pilot to contend with. The pilot\u2019s decision to attempt a downwind landing in gusting wind conditions likely resulted in his loss of airplane control and subsequent impact with terrain. The airport was also equipped with a 90-degree intersecting runway, runway 30, which should have been the runway of choice given the prevailing wind; it was not clear why the pilot did not elect to use this runway. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.",

About 15 minutes into the flight, the air traffic controller observed that the pilot was not flying assigned headings. When queried, the pilot responded that he was \"\u2026a little disoriented\u2026\" The pilot continued to deviate from assigned headings as he was vectored to the airport for the approach. During his first attempt at the instrument landing system (ILS) approach, the pilot executed a missed approach, citing problems with his engine monitor. Following the missed approach, the air traffic controller issued a low altitude alert to the pilot. On his second attempt at an ILS approach, the pilot unknowingly deviated well right of the localizer course and was instructed to climb immediately due to another low altitude alert. The pilot was then vectored to an intersection south of the airport and was offered a global positioning system (GPS) approach. The pilot continued to have difficulty with heading and altitude control, receiving an additional low altitude alert from the air traffic controller. The pilot subsequently informed the controller that he had \"complete gyro failure\" and needed assistance with heading and altitude monitoring. When asked if he was tracking a navigational aid, the pilot responded that he was \"\u2026a little dizzy\u2026\" The pilot asked for an altitude check at 5,200 feet mean sea level (msl) and the controller confirmed that altitude on his radar.

There was no surge or popping sound associated with the sudden loss of power.  The pilot selected the second fuel tank, completed engine out emergency procedures, but was unable to restart the engine, and selected a two lane road for landing.  During the landing the airplane snagged multiple power lines and came to rest partially suspended from the broken power lines. The airplane's fuel system had been modified from the firewall forward, with a canister type of fuel filter and an Ellison throttle body.  Removal and examination of the fuel filter disclosed brown, rust-colored corrosion. Sludge was inside the filter canister, and rust-colored stains were on the filter element.  Examination of the fuel tanks revealed rust-colored deposits around the fuel tank outlets.  The rust-colored deposits and stains are consistent with water contamination in the fuel filter canister and fuel tank, and indicates that the fuel system had been exposed to water for some time.  The engine maintenance logbook recorded that an annual examination was completed on July 1, 2007, and that \"all fuel and oil screens/filters checked,\" which was not consistent with the physical condition of the fuel filter as examined after the accident.",

Immediately after takeoff, about 30 to 40 feet above ground level (agl), the helicopter began to vibrate.  The pilot lowered the collective to the full down position, and the helicopter touched down about 30 to 40 knots ground speed.  Upon touchdown, the pilot had difficulty maintaining directional control and the helicopter slid about 300 feet across terrain.  The helicopter's NOTAR anti-torque yaw control system utilizes a transmission driven fan with variable pitch blades to supply air to circulation control slots on the tail boom and a pilot controlled directional jet thruster nozzle.  Movement of the anti-torque control pedals changes the fan blade pitch to produce more or less airflow to the circulation control slots and the anti-torque thruster nozzle.  As the pedals are displaced from center toward either extreme of travel, the airflow increases or decreases proportionally.  A post-accident examination of the NOTAR fan system revealed that one of the thirteen Tension-Torsion (T-T) straps located on the variable-pitch fan assembly had failed.  The failed strap had accumulated about 1,694 hours of time in service, though the design safe life for the strap was 2,500 hours of time in service.  An examination of the strap revealed that it had fractured as a result of the progressive failure of its reinforcement fibers.  This progressive fiber failure gradually degraded the strap's integrity until it could no longer support normal in-service tensile loads.  In normal operation, the T-T straps are exposed to tensile loads due to the centrifugal force induced by the blade rotation about the anti-torque fan axis.  The straps are additionally exposed to torsional loads about their longitudinal axis as the blade pitch is changed.  The point-symmetric locations of the failure areas were consistent with loading that would occur as the strap was twisted with limited centrifugal force loads present; the twisting direction corresponds to an increase in blade pitch.  The Safety Board Materials Laboratory performed load analyses of the straps, revealing that when the strap is twisted without the presence of centrifugal force, portions of the fiber reinforced region of the strap are subjected to compression and transverse shear stresses.  Furthermore, the compression and transverse shear stresses are highest in the locations where the subject strap failed.  When the anti-torque fan is rotated at speeds less than an approximate 75 percent of maximum power, compression, and transverse shear stresses can develop in the straps when the blade pitch is adjusted.  Additionally, with no fan rotation (and therefore no centrifugal force) critical buckling strains on the strap's fibers can be achieved by increasing the blade pitch to near the design limits.  This could plausibly occur during a preflight inspection when the pilot checks pedal control surface movement prior to starting the engine.  All T-T strap load and fatigue tests preformed by the helicopter manufacturer incorporate centrifugal force loads, and therefore, do not test the full load spectrum.",
            "probable_cause": "fracture of a Tension-Torsion strap in the anti-torque fan due to progressive fiber failure of the composite strap material from compression and/or transverse shear stresses that occurred with repeated manipulation of the cockpit anti-torque control pedals without the fan operating at full rpm.  A factor in the accident was the helicopter manufacturer's inadequate fatigue and load testing on the strap."

The airplane's two inboard wing fuel tanks, each having a 36 gallon capacity, were completely full before departure; however, in order to keep the airplane below its maximum gross weight at departure, the two outboard wing fuel tanks were each partially fueled with 25 gallons. The pilot reported that the inboard fuel tanks were used for engine startup, taxi, takeoff, and climb to the initial cruise altitude assigned by air traffic control. After reaching the initial cruise altitude, he switched to the outboard fuel tanks and leaned the mixture setting for optimal fuel consumption. About 2 hours into the flight, the pilot switched back to the inboard fuel tanks after the engines had consumed the useable fuel in the two outboard fuel tanks. The pilot reported that when the flight was about 7 miles from the destination airport, descending through 3,500 feet mean sea level, the right engine lost total power. The pilot feathered the right propeller, secured the right engine, and continued toward the planned destination. Shortly thereafter, the left engine lost total power and the pilot feathered the propeller and secured the engine. The pilot reported that he delayed extending the landing gear until the airplane cleared a row of trees that bordered the harvested soybean field that he selected for the forced landing. After clearing the trees, the pilot attempted to extend the landing gear by moving the landing gear selector handle to the down position; however, because the left engine was inoperative, a normal landing gear extension with the engine driven hydraulic pump was not possible. The pilot immediately attempted to extend the landing gear using the emergency hand-pump, but the airplane impacted terrain before the landing gear was fully extended. Upon contact with the terrain, the nose and left main landing gear collapsed. The left wing and fuselage sustained substantial damage during the forced landing.A postaccident examination of the airplane established that the inboard and outboard fuel tanks were void of any useable fuel. The pilot reported that the accident flight was about 4 hours 20 minutes in duration and that fuel exhaustion was the reason that both engines had lost total power. Before departing on the accident flight, he estimated that the flight would require about 118 gallons of fuel, and as such, there would be about 4 gallons of fuel remaining at the completion of the flight. However, after the accident, the pilot acknowledged that he failed to account for the 6.8 gallons of unusable fuel within the fuel system. Additionally, the airplane was equipped with an emergency carbon-dioxide blowdown system that the pilot could have used to rapidly extend the landing gear instead of the more laborious and time consuming emergency hand-pump. The pilot did not offer an explanation on why he chose to use the emergency hand-pump instead of the carbon-dioxide blowdown system. Had the landing gear been fully extended before landing, it is likely that the landing gear would not have collapsed.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper fuel management, which resulted in the total loss of power to both engines due to fuel exhaustion and the subsequent forced landing in a field. Also causal to the accident was the pilot's decision to use the slower emergency hand-pump to extend the landing gear instead of the available carbon-dioxide blowdown system, which resulted in a landing without the landing gear fully extended."

The pilot estimated that the glider climbed from 4,000 feet msl to about 6,200 feet msl in about 20 seconds.  At peak altitude the right wing separated from the glider, at the root.  The pilot said he believed the wing separated upward, and made contact with the top of the canopy. He attempted numerous combinations of control imputes.  The glider yawed, rolled and pitched with little response to the controls, and finally became upright in a high yaw rate condition.  The glider impacted in a thick stand of 80-to 100-foot tall pine trees.  The reported cloud bases at the time of the accident were reported to be 4,300 feet msl.  The floor of the Class B airspace was 3,000 feet msl at the location of the accident, and the aircraft was operating at the time of the accident without gyro instruments.  A section of the right wing front spar was sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, DC, for examination.  The examination revealed that the fracture features and deformations were all consistent with 'overstress separations.'  No evidence of fatigue or any type of cracking was found. ",

After loading his passenger, he set the throttle and the parking brake, but he elected not to tie down the airplane or place chocks in front of its wheels. When he pulled the propeller through, the engine started immediately as he intended. However, he had placed the throttle in a position that resulted in a higher rpm than he expected. Due to the high rpm, the parking brake was unable to hold the airplane in position, and it started rolling forward with only the passenger inside. The pilot attempted to reenter the airplane, but he was unable to do so. Although the passenger was able to steer the airplane along the taxiway, she did not know how to stop it, and it eventually went through a fence and over an embankment.

He was near the mid-point (about 24 miles from the shoreline) of the lake with a 40-knot headwind, so he turned around to return to shore. He attempted to restart the engine but was unsuccessful. The pilot ditched the airplane about 5 miles from shore and it quickly sank. Postaccident inspection of the airplane revealed that the firewall fuel strainer gasket did not provide a complete seal between the fuel screen and the fuel strainer's upper body. A portion of the gasket was positioned over the exit port, which created a gap. This allowed debris in the fuel to migrate to the engine's fuel inlet filter screen in the fuel metering assembly. The inspection of the fuel inlet filter screen revealed that it was partially obstructed with debris. The orifice of the fuel inlet passage contained the same debris that obstructed the flow of fuel through the orifice to the fuel screen. The airplane had undergone an annual maintenance inspection about 7.5 hours prior to the accident. The mechanic, who had an inspection authorization, reported that he did not inspect the gasket on the firewall fuel strainer, nor did he remove and inspect the fuel inlet filter screen as required by the manufacturer's service manual. The debris was composed of materials similar to wood chips, sawdust, paint, varnish, cloth, glass fibers, metal shavings, sand, and soil. The source of the contaminants was not determined.

The CFI stated that his regular method for setting up practice engine-out landings for a student was to close the mixture, allow the student to go through the process of controlling the airplane, and simulating the procedures to feather the inoperative engine's propeller.  The instructor would then return the mixture to full rich, and verify engine operation. This would occur on downwind, and then the landing would be completed with the simulated inoperative engine at idle. On downwind, the instructor closed the mixture on the left engine. During this maneuver, the pilot turned the airplane left from base to final and the airspeed decreased. The airplane rolled sharply to the left and lost altitude. The instructor reduced both throttles and regained control of the airplane just as it collided with the roof of one house, bounced across another roof, and came to rest on top of a third house.

The last winds from the tower were 340 degrees at 22 kts, with gusts to 35 knots. The maximum demonstrated crosswind for the airplane was 30 knots. The ATIS contained runway condition data that was 1 hour old.  Inside the final approach fix, the captain elected to land with the wing flaps set at 22 degrees, rather than 45 degrees due to the wind.

When he started his approach, there was a crosswind of about five knots, but just about the time he was going to start his landing flare, the aircraft encountered a stronger gust. This resulted in the aircraft ballooning upward. The student pilot attempted to correct the ballooning by pushing forward on the control yoke, but his actions resulted in the aircraft striking the runway hard enough to bend the firewall and to start a fuel leak in the engine compartment. The pilot exited the aircraft while it was still on the runway, and soon after he was out of the cockpit, the aircraft caught on fire. The pilot was able to put the fire out once, but it reignited, and the aircraft was ultimately consumed by the flames.

It resumed running a couple of times but finally stopped altogether.  The pilot made a forced landing on a dirt road, damaging the aircraft.  The aircraft was last serviced with 20.8 gallons of aviation fuel on the previous day.  The pilot computed the fuel requirement for the flight by using the fuel consumption chart in the pilot operator's handbook.  After a flight of 0.2 hours on the day before, the pilot estimated that he had 3 hours 55 minutes of fuel remaining (without reserve) for his cross-country flight.  At the time the engine quit, the Hobbs meter showed that a total of 3 hours 36 minutes had elapsed.  The average fuel consumption for the fuel load was 6.8 gallons per hour.  The fuel capacity of the aircraft is 26 gallons with 1.5 gallons unusable.  When asked about his planning, he acknowledged that his planning estimate of 6 gallons per hour had not considered the additional fuel requirements for his initial takeoff and climb, nor the seven other landings and takeoffs that he subsequently made since his last refueling.

The rate that the nose descended seemed to be commanded and extremely smooth.  The first officer wondered if he could have accidentally bumped his sidestick, but he did not think that action occurred.  The captain landed the airplane with the main landing gear touching down first, and the captain's sidestick was once again responsive.  The entire event took no longer than 2 seconds.  No electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM) warnings or other indications were noticed by the flight crew.  Review of the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data revealed that the captain's sidestick (left) was inoperative for approximately 1 second during the landing flare.  During that time, the first officer's sidestick (right) pitch was in the neutral position.  Less than one second after the captain's sidestick went to inoperative, both sidestick pitch positions went to approximately 14-16 degrees aft.  Pitch data revealed a decrease in pitch of approximately 2 degrees during the event.  The airframe manufacturer provided the following analysis of the incident:  \"Captain was Pilot Flying (PF).  First officer was Pilot Non Flying (PNF).  Manual approach and flare input from the PF were nominal.  But, it appeared that [the] PNF take-over and priority pushbutton was pushed inadvertently for approximately 1 to 2 seconds during flare.

With the F/O priority button pressed, EFCS (Electrical Flight Control System) disregarded the captain inputs to the benefit of the F/O one.  During this time, as no order (neutral) was applied on F/O sidestick, aircraft elevators returned to neutral position, leading pitch attitude to be reduced by 1.5 degrees.  EFCS switched back to captain sidestick when priority switch was released, and captain resumed flare and landing uneventfully.\"  According to operator, the non-flying pilot's hand should not be on the sidestick during critical phases of flight, such as the landing flare; however, the non-flying pilot should be in a position to takeover control, if required.",

Because runway length was not a critical factor, the instructor decided to let the student continue on the higher than desired glideslope so that he would learn that it would take him past the desired point of touchdown. Reportedly, when the aircraft was still about 20 feet above the runway surface, the student reduced the power to idle and started to flare prematurely, and the aircraft ultimately leveled off about 10 feet above the runway. The instructor then advised the student that they were too high, and that if they landed from that height \"...it would be rough.\" The student therefore added power (about one-quarter throttle) and lowered the nose in order to descend to a point closer to the runway. Soon after starting to make this adjustment, the student flared a second time, and the aircraft fell to the runway surface from an altitude that was still too high. As the aircraft began to fall toward the runway, the instructor reached for the throttle in order to initiate a go-around, but just as he made contact with it, the aircraft impacted the runway with sufficient force to result in substantial damage.

Examination of the airplane revealed both sides of the No. 1 engine fan cowl were separated. The inboard fan cowl door was found approximately 7.5 nautical miles west southwest of the airport, and the outboard fan cowl door was found beside the runway. Examination of the latching mechanisms on each cowl door revealed no evidence of failure or mechanical malfunction. A mechanic stated he opened the fan cowl for the No. 1 engine prior to the flight, and he could not recall if the cowl doors were fully latched. A review of data provided by the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) of Canada revealed that, between 1991 and September 2000, there were ten similar cowl door separation events documented worldwide, and each involved the cowl doors having been opened prior to the flight. Examination of the incident airplane revealed it was equipped with the modifications outlined in Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2003-18-06 amendment 39-13297, which mandates the installation of a hold-open device for the cowl doors, as well as a modification of the latch handles to ensure that unfastened latch handles will hang down.

Severe corrosion was found at two structural tube clusters (one with a windshield pillar) located directly below the right wing forward and aft attach fittings.  The portion of the forward structure available for carrying loads prior to the accident was less than 30% of the circumference of the pillar tube.  Deformation associated with the separation of the pillar tube indicates that the pillar failed under compression loads.  The manufacturer's representative stated that the 'windshield pillar is normally subjected to a tensile load during flight.'  It is possible that compression loads generated during the takeoff roll led to a compression failure of the pillar.

The pilot was given air traffic advisories for airplanes departing a satellite airport, but was not given an advisory about a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airplane that was on final approach to land at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.  The pilot said he did not specifically recall seeing the MD-11.  The accident airplane encountered wake turbulence from the MD-11 that produced a violent vertical wind shear.  The pilot then noticed the MD-11 airplane.  After landing at a satellite airport, he notified the FAA of the wake turbulence event.  Radar data revealed the MD-11 was on the glide path for landing at Anchorage, and the pilot of the MD-11 was in radio contact with the tower.  The accident airplane crossed the flight path of the MD-11 at a 90 degree angle, about 900 feet msl, and about 55 seconds after the MD-11.  When the accident airplane encountered the wake turbulence, it was 300 feet below the flight path of the MD-11 and separated by 2.47 miles.  A postflight inspection of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the right wing.  The Anchorage International Airport is within Class C airspace, which has a high volume mix of air carrier, general aviation, and military aircraft.  Class D, Class E, and Class G airspace surround, and underlie the Class C area.  In addition, the airspace is subject to Federal Aviation Regulation Part 93 (FAR 93).  FAR 93 outlines geographic segments and special rules for operating at airports within the area.  An air traffic controller is required to separate small aircraft operating behind heavy aircraft by 5 miles, and issue traffic advisories, and safety alerts including wake turbulence cautionary advisories.  The TRACON utilizes certain prearranged coordination procedures to improve the traffic flow of aircraft through TRACON radar segments.  Controllers are required to view a full data block on their radar screen when using prearranged coordination.  The air traffic controller did not have a full data block displayed.  The TRACON procedures manual does not contain a procedure for challenging, and verifying, the use or non-use of prearranged coordination between controllers.  The air traffic controller did not notice that an aircraft designation symbol displayed on his screen indicated a heavy aircraft, and he did not issue a wake turbulence advisory.  A heavy aircraft designator ('H' if assigned) is displayed on all radar data blocks (full or partial). ",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the TRACON air traffic controller to issue a wake turbulence advisory to the pilot, and a wake turbulence encounter by the pilot.  Factors in the accident were the pilot's inadequate visual lookout, the failure of the TRACON controller to notice an aircraft as a heavy jet, and insufficiently defined TRACON procedures used to facilitate prearranged coordination of aircraft through radar segments.

The pilot performed prelanding checks on downwind, and upon switching on the second fuel pump, the engine lost power.  The pilot switched the fuel pump to the original position and selected  the other fuel tank.  Neither action caused the engine to regain its power.  The pilot attempted to lower the electrically powered flaps to prepare for the emergency landing on the runway but the flaps failed to deploy.  The airplane carried an excess of 30 to 40 knots while flying 10 to 20 feet above the runway; the pilot determined that he would easily overrun the 2,480-foot-long runway and impact structures at the end if he did not divert the airplanes path.  He pulled up and turned left 180 degrees to dissipate the extra energy and landed along the vine rows of the neighboring vineyard.  First responders reported that there appeared to be no fuel in the airplane's fuel tanks nor evidence of a post accident fuel spill or leak from the airplane.  The pilot said that the airplane's electrical system powers the engine's electronic ignition, propeller pitch control,  and flaps.

The pilot stated that he departed with full fuel tanks consisting of 40 gallons in the main wing tanks (a 20-gallon tank in each wing)  and 14 gallons in the auxiliary tank.  The pilot did not detect any problems with the airplane during the flight.  Upon arriving in the vicinity of Napa he learned that the weather was below IFR minimums.  He diverted to Angwin to wait for the weather to improve and landed about 0915.  After the Napa weather improved, the pilot departed Angwin at 1030.  The pilot said he did not refuel at Angwin and he determined that he had about 30 total gallons of fuel onboard.  The pilot received an IFR clearance upon approaching APC.  During the localizer approach into runway 36L, he was advised that he was too high and to execute a missed approach.  As the flight began the missed approach, the controller issued a holding clearance and the pilot stated \"...fuel's getting low...\" as a result, the controller issued vectors to intercept the localizer into APC.  During climb out, between 2,500 to 3,000 feet, the engine began to lose power.  The pilot requested immediate vectors to APC.  During this time, the pilot performed emergency operations: switching fuel tanks, engaging carburetor heat, checking mixture control, and engaging the fuel boost pump.  This momentarily restored power, and the pilot advised the approach controller; however, within a few moments the engine again lost partial power.  The engine completely lost engine power shortly thereafter.  The pilot broke out of the cloud layer and was approximately 200 feet above ground level (agl) and found only water below him.  The pilot advised the controller that he would be landing in the water and then executed a \"slow, stalled landing.\"  The aircraft came to rest inverted.  The pilot freed himself from the airplane, and a passing fishing boat rescued him.  A FAA inspector examined the airplane and found no evidence of damage or a malfunction that would have caused the engine to stop running.  The FAA inspector was unable to determine if there had been fuel on board the airplane at the time of the accident due to water in the airplane's fuel system.

The day of the accident the pilot and 1 passenger departed on an uneventful 20 minute flight to another airport where 1 additional passenger boarded the airplane.  The flight departed and during climbout at 6,500 feet msl with the autopilot engaged, the VFR pilot noted adverse weather ahead as depicted on the airplane's stormscope.  He disengaged the autopilot and turned 90 degrees to the left to avoid the weather.  The flight encountered IMC conditions and a downdraft losing 2,000-3,000 feet of altitude.  The airplane then encountered an updraft during which the airspeed decreased and the engine quit.  The pilot maintained a nose-low attitude to descend and placed the mixture control to the full rich position and turned on the auxiliary fuel pump in an effort to restore engine power.  Engine power was not restored and the pilot performed a forced landing in a planted millet field.  During recovery of the airplane, 28-30 gallons of fuel were noted in the left fuel tank and no fuel was noted in the right fuel tank which was later found to be compromised consisting of a crack.  No fuel leakage was noted at the accident site from the point where the airplane touched down to the point where the airplane came to rest.  Additionally, no fuel stains were noted on the upper or lower surfaces of the right wing.  The fuel vents of both fuel tanks were clear and there were no obstructions of the fuel lines from either fuel tank to the center section of the wing.  A temporary fuel tank was plumbed into the fuel selector valve and with it positioned to the left and right positions, fuel flow was noted at each fuel injector nozzle.  Examination of the engine revealed crankshaft, camshaft, and valve train continuity, no evidence of lack of lubrication was noted.  The impulse couplings and components of both impulse couplings were broken.  Metallurgical examination of the broken components of both impulse couplings revealed that with the exception of the main spring from the impulse coupling of the left magneto, all fracture surfaces exhibited overstress failure.  The main spring of the impulse coupling of the left magneto exhibited fatigue signatures; the spring met specification for material, width, and thickness.  The roll trim motor actuator was positioned to correct for a left wing heavy situation.

The CFI took control when he determined that they would have to fly a lot faster to beat the storm.  About 3 miles south of the field, he noted that the ceiling was descending rapidly enough that he would have to go below the glide slope in order to maintain cloud clearance.  He descended with spoilers and told the student to prepare for an off airport landing in a farmer's field short of the airport.  The CFI set up for landing.  He had to turn and change his path at the last second when he noticed an irrigation sprinkler in his path.  The right wing tip contacted the ground, and the glider ground looped during landing, which resulted in substantial damage to the tail boom.  The pilot indicated that he had obtained an abbreviated weather brief via telephone and the internet.  The weather at the nearest official reporting station, which was 28 nautical miles north of the accident site/departure airport, was similar for a 6-hour period up to an hour before the glider's departure.  The weather reports noted 10 miles visibility; winds from the north about 14 knots; and ceilings above 14,000 feet.  In the next 30 minutes, the weather deteriorated to 1-mile visibility in light snow; winds gusting 22 to 30 knots; and a 1,000-foot ceiling.  In the next 10 minutes, the visibility dropped to 1/4 mile; 20 minutes later the visibility was 3/4 mile.  Over the next hour, the weather improved to 10 miles visibility; winds 14 gusting to 22 knots; and overcast conditions at 6,000 feet.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight's encounter with a low ceiling while on approach that necessatiated an off-airport precautionary landing on unsuitable terrain.  Obstructions were a factor."

The commercial pilot was seriously injured, and the single passenger was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to, and operated by, the commercial pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91. The airplane's left wing was separated from the fuselage resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. Marginal visual flight rules (MVFR) conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight originated at John Wayne-Orange County Airport, Santa Ana, California, about 0800.The pilot was in communications with Oakland Center while on the GPS-A approach into Truckee-Tahoe Airport. Upon completion of the instrument approach the pilot executed a missed approach and proceeded to fly in an easterly direction not consistent with the published missed approach procedures. Oakland Center lost radar contact and radio communications with the airplane and pilot. The airplane wreckage was located about an hour later in the mountain range east of the airport at an elevation of 8,000 feet mean sea level (msl).The Truckee-Tahoe Airport Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS-3) reported at 0950 that the wind was from 180 degrees at 7 knots; visibility was 9 statute miles, and an overcast cloud layer was at 3,000 feet above ground level (agl). At 1050, the reported weather conditions were wind from 300 degrees at 5 knots; 6 miles visibility in light rain, and an overcast cloud layer at 2,200 feet agl.The published minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the Truckee-Tahoe GPS-A approach is 8,200 feet mean sea level (2,300 feet agl).",

Shortly after the initial contact, the weather conditions deteriorated and instrument meteorological conditions became effective.  The pilot was advised of the weather conditions and given vectors to intercept the ILS 10L approach.  As the aircraft was turning inbound to intercept the localizer, the air traffic controller notified the pilot that it appeared that he was aligned for the ILS 10R approach.  The pilot advised the controller that he had tuned in the wrong frequency and asked the controller for the correct frequency.  The controller informed the pilot of the correct frequency for the ILS 10L approach.  Due to other air traffic, the controller instructed the pilot to turn to a northerly heading for vectors to the ILS 10L approach.  The pilot complied with the controllers instructions and shortly thereafter was aligned for the ILS 10L approach.  After the aircraft was established on the localizer and cleared to land, the flight course maintained a constant descent rate, magnetic heading and airspeed.

The pilot executed a 180-degree turn and landed back at the helipad.  The NOTAR fan drive system was disassembled for examination.  The Aft Tube Assembly transmits antitorque pedal inputs to the NOTAR fan blade pitch change mechanism and moves fore and aft through the hollow rotating fan drive shaft.  The tube does not rotate.  Three distinct areas of circumferential scoring were noted on the tube; one in the center at roughly the middle of the drive shaft, and one at each end of the tube corresponding to locations just within the fan drive gear box on the forward end and just inside of the fan assembly.  The pilot reported that during an earlier flight in the accident helicopter, the antitorque pedals seemed to stick or slightly bind with 2 inches of right pedal displacement.  The pilot stated that this was an annoying problem that regularly occurred with all the 520N's in their fleet, and that the maintenance department typically cleared it up by cleaning (lightly sanding) a Teflon coated sliding tube in the NOTAR fan assembly.  According to the pilot, dirt and oil would get on this sliding tube and cause it to bind in the housing, and the mechanics would simply clean this tube to resolve the problem.  Maintenance department mechanics confirmed that the pedal-sticking problem typically involved foreign material on the aft tubes' Teflon coated pitch slider, and that they routinely resolved the discrepancies by removing the aft tube and lightly sanding the Teflon coating with fine sand paper.   With the exception of the aft tube and it's associated pitch slider shaft, extensive examinations and tests of the NOTAR system components revealed no anomalies that could be related to the vibratory event.  Examination of the pitch slider shaft found numerous, very fine, axial scratches on the surface, and measurements found that the outer diameter had been reduced by up to 0.014 inch from the manufacturer's specified constant 0.818 inch (+0.001 inch).  The hand sanding of the liner resulted in axial surface scratches and a variable shaft outer diameter that was smaller than that required by the MDHI specification.  The decreased and variable liner OD degraded the ability to isolate the aft tube assembly from drive system vibrations.  The bending mode natural frequencies of the aft tube assembly were assessed to be 65, 220, and 450 Hz.  Initial MDHI estimates stated that the first bending mode natural frequency of the aft tube assembly was 94 Hz.  The operational rotor speed of the MDHI 520N helicopter is 7.95 Hz, and the operational NOTAR fan and drive system rotational speed is 89.4 Hz.  While in comparison, the measured first bending mode natural frequency of the aft tube assembly of 65 Hz offers a margin of 24.4 Hz under the 89.4 Hz operating speed of the NOTAR fan drive syste;, the actual natural frequency may be higher and result in a smaller margin.  The investigation determined that a maintenance practice of sanding the Teflon coated pitch slider tube in the NOTAR assembly resulted in excessive clearance between the antitorque system components.  This excessive clearance allowed a vibration to occur in those components resulting in the noise and airframe vibrations noted by the pilots.",
            "probable_cause": "the excitation of the first bending mode natural frequency of the aft tube assembly that is installed through the rotating NOTAR fan drive system.  Contributing factors to the incident included the operator's maintenance practice of hand-sanding the pitch slider component of the NOTAR fan system."

The main component of the 9-volt battery had a flashpoint of 21 degrees Fahrenheit, or room temperature. Other batteries, located in the same pocket of the equipment bag as the 9-volt battery, had unprotected contacts, including two fully charged 14-volt battery packs. One of the 14-volt battery packs displayed significant exterior thermal damage, consistent with damage from coming in contact with another battery. Battery industry research has revealed that a short circuit is the most common cause of battery fires, often initiated by contacts coming into contact with metal objects.

Upon initial clearance to descend from cruise altitude, the pilot advised the controller that he might have to stay higher due to ice.  The pilot was subsequently cleared to 7,000 feet, instead of the initial 4,000 feet.  About 15 miles from the destination airport, the pilot was cleared for a Global Positioning System (GPS) approach and instructed to maintain 3,900 feet until reaching the initial approach fix.  The pilot subsequently inquired about descending lower and was cleared to 3,600 feet.  The pilot commented that the airplane was \"picking up some ice here, so we're trying to be real careful.\"  Track data indicated that the airplane continued toward the airport, descending as low as 3,200 feet.  However, about 2.25 miles from the airport, the pilot declared a missed approach, stating: \"We're picking up too much ice.\"  The flight was cleared to an alternate airport and instructed to climb to 5,000 feet.  However, the airplane was unable to climb above 4,500 feet and the pilot reported that the airplane was still picking up ice.  The pilot subsequently stated that he was unable to maintain altitude because of \"more ice.\"  He requested vectors out of the icing conditions, but the controller was not aware of any area being better regarding icing.  The pilot noted he was \"losing altitude now pretty good.\"  The pilot selected an intermediate airport that was closer to his present position.  The controller cleared the flight as requested and instructed the pilot to maintain 4,000 feet.  The pilot replied, \"All I can do is 4,000.\"  Track data indicated that the flight was established on an east-southeasterly course, and passed about 0.6 miles south of the intermediate airport.  It entered a left turn to a northeast course and passed the airport, apparently intending to return for landing.  The airplane impacted trees and terrain about 1.75 miles northeast of the intermediate airport.  A witness stated that the airplane came through the treetops, \"nose dived into the ground\" and spun around, before coming to rest.  GPS altitude data revealed a steadily increasing descent rate after reaching 4,500 during the diversion to the alternate.  Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisories for moderate icing were in effect.  The AIRMET coverage area included the destination and alternate airports.  The pilot obtained two pre-flight weather briefings during which he was advised of the AIRMET.  Although, the AIRMET was updated after the briefings, the predicted icing intensity and geographical coverage area remained the same.  A post accident inspection of the airplane did not reveal any anomalies consistent with a pre-impact failure or malfunction.  Several ice fragments, consistent in appearance to rime ice, were observed on the ground at the accident site by initial responders.  The fragments exhibited a contour approximately matching the profile of the wing leading edge.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook stated that the airplane was not certified for flight into known icing conditions.  The handbook advised that in the case of an inadvertent icing encounter, \"evasive action should be initiated immediately when icing conditions are first encountered.\"",

The cargo ramp area where the accident occurred is considered a nonmovement area, and therefore, not under the control of the control tower.  There are no signs concerning jet blast in the accident area.  The CL-600 was parked in a designated spot with the tail facing a blast fence.  According to the pilot's statement, while his airplane was being loaded with cargo he noted CL-600 with its \"tail light on\" and heard it doing a run-up.  He received a clearance from the ground controller to taxi from the south cargo area to runway 25L via taxiway H to H7.  The pilot said that after getting his taxi clearance he looked and it appeared that the CL-600's run-up had been completed and the engines seemed to be at idle.  As he taxied behind the CL-600 following a taxi line between the CL-600 and the blast fence he felt his airplane buffet, and heard the engines spool up.  The pilot stated that he did not see the red beacon light blinking on the CL-600 prior to crossing behind it.   According to the maintenance crew in the CL-600, they contacted PHX South Ground from the Cutter ramp and requested permission to relocate to the south cargo ramp for maintenance engine runs.  After proceeding to the south cargo ramp, they had to wait for outbound traffic to park.  The maintenance crew stated that they parked in a designated parking spot in front of the blast fence.  One mechanic reported that per the normal engine run procedures the position/navigation and beacon lights were on.  Prior to performing the power assurance engine run they verified that there were no aircraft, equipment, or personnel within \"the danger zone of our engine run up.\"  About 3 to 5 minutes into the run-up, at high power, they were signaled to shutdown their engines and saw the damaged airplane behind them.  Three witnesses at the southwest corner of the cargo area, near the United Postal Service (UPS) area, reported that the CL-600 had been doing a run-up for 3 to 5 minutes prior to the Cessna 208 taxiing behind it.  These witnesses all reported that they did not observe a flashing beacon light on CL-600.  Witnesses at the FedEx maintenance office observed the CL-600 conducting an engine run at high power with the rotating beacon lights on.  Review of the ATC tapes disclosed that the CL-600 had been cleared to relocate to the south cargo ramp for engine test runs and that the Cessna 208 had been given a taxi clearance from the ramp without mention of the CL-600 performing engine run-ups on the ramp.",

About 10 minutes later, while about 30 miles north of Klamath Falls, the pilot reported he was low on fuel and was not able to find the city.  The tower responded with instructions that would take the pilot south to the airport.  But because the pilot seemed not to be following the instructions, but was instead continuing to the west, he was switched to Seattle Center.  Center provided the pilot with a southeasterly heading direct to Klamath Falls, but less than a minute later radar and radio contact with the aircraft was lost.  Other pilots overheard the pilot transmit that he had lost power in one engine, and later state that he had lost power in both.  Soon thereafter the aircraft was seen to descend to about 200 to 300 feet above the surface of Lake of the Woods.  The aircraft then began to slow and its nose began to rise.  As it was slowing, one of the engines surged back to a high power setting, and the aircraft almost immediately rolled quickly to the side and dove nearly straight down into the lake. During the post-accident inspection of the airframe, the throttle for the right engine was found retarded to idle, but the throttle for the left engine was found in the full-forward (maximum power) position. A review of the Aerostar owner's manual revealed that the Engine Failure/Restart checklist called for the throttle for a failed engine (both engines in this case) to be retarded to the 'Cracked 1/2 inch open' position. Toxicological results indicate the presence in the pilot's blood of chlordiazepoxide and three of its active metabolites, norchlordiazepoxide, nordiazepam, and oxazepam.  Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) is a tranquilizer often used to treat anxiety and tension.  At sufficient levels it can have significant adverse effects on judgement, alertness, and performance.  It is known to cause drowsiness, mental dullness, and euphoria.  The results also indicate the presence of diphenhydramine in the pilot's blood.  Diphenhydramine is a sedating antihistamine, and in sufficient quantities is known to produce drowsiness, impaired coordination, blurred vision, and reduced mental alertness. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to set the throttle of his second failed engine to 'Cracked-1/2-Open' as called for in the Engine Failure/Restart checklist, followed by a high-power engine surge.  Factors include the pilot's delay in landing for refueling, the pilot becoming lost/disoriented, drug impairment, and fuel exhaustion. "

An engine run-up before takeoff was performed by the pilot-rated passenger in the left front seat and the rpm decrease when checking each magneto was approximately 75.  The flight was cleared to takeoff from runway 27 with all runway available (8,500 feet), and the pilot reported the airplane became airborne in no more than 2,000 feet.  The Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM) indicates that based on the conditions at the time of the accident, the total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle was 2,250 feet.  The pilot reportedly climbed at blue-line airspeed and kept the landing gear retracted until insufficient runway remained to land where he was flying at 50 feet above ground level.  The POH/AFM indicates that the airplane was capable of climbing at 800 feet-per-minute with the landing gear and flaps extended, and full power on both engines.  The controller reported that the airplane was climbing \"very slow\", and he did not hear of a loss of engine power nor did he see smoke trailing from the engines during takeoff.  The pilot reported that when he retracted the landing gear, the engine sound decreased and he sensed the airplane was not accelerating, but this was not indicated on the engine gauges, nor was it indicated by the airplane yawing,so he did not check for an engine out.  He confirmed the throttle, mixture, and propeller controls were full forward, and a short time later he heard the stall warning horn and pitched down to maintain blue-line airspeed.  He thought about returning to the departure airport but lost altitude during a turn.  He lowered the landing gear, flew under powerlines, and impacted in a field in a wings level attitude.

The student pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the local flight that originated at Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (TJIG), Isla Grande, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The solo instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the student pilot's flight instructor, the student pilot arrived at the hangar about 0800 and began his preflight inspection of the helicopter. Upon completion of the inspection they spoke for about 20 minutes about the weather conditions at the airport, whether he had all of his documents on him, how long he would fly and what he would be practicing on the flight. They then wheeled the helicopter outside and the student pilot made final preparations for the flight.About 0845, the student pilot started the helicopter and about 10 minutes later shut it down and walked to the hanger. He explained that the tower controller had said that his request to make right closed traffic patterns could not be accommodated at that time and to try again later. About 0920, the flight instructor phoned the tower to see if the flight could go and got an affirmative response, so he sent the student pilot back out to continue the flight.The helicopter departed the ramp about 0930 and remained in the traffic pattern for approximately 1 hour. As the flight instructor was sitting in the hangar, he noticed that it was taking longer than normal since he had heard the helicopter go by. He stepped outside and visually located the helicopter in a left holding pattern south of the airport which was standard procedure when the tower needed sequencing for other aircraft, then he went back inside. A few more minutes went by and the flight instructor still had not heard the helicopter, so he went outside again, but was unable to locate the helicopter. He then noticed a ports authority vehicle driving towards the police hangar, and a minute or so later he saw one of the police helicopters begin to spin up. At that moment, the flight instructor suspected a problem so he called the control tower, the controller told him that he had seen the helicopter spinning and that it had then impacted the water by Cata\u00f1o Point.According another pilot, his low-wing airplane was number three approaching the airport, about 3 to 4 miles on a straight-in approach to runway 9, with the helicopter number two to land. The tower controller asked the pilot if he had the helicopter in sight, after which, the pilot saw an aircraft about \u00bd mile ahead, about the 2:30 positon (off the right side) of his airplane.The pilot originally thought he saw a radio-controlled (RC) helicopter, because it was emitting white smoke from the back, as did the RC helicopters he was used to flying. He then saw it do a series of right 360-degree turns \"around the rotor head,\" with the fuselage vertical, and realized it was a helicopter. While turning to the right, the helicopter climbed 100 to 200 feet, reaching an estimated 800 feet. As it did, the ends of both rotor blades coned upwards to where the blades tips were vertical, with the major bending occurring about \u00bc blade span from the ends of the blades.The witness then saw the helicopter's nose drop, and the helicopter entered a descent, spiraling downward to the right three or four times until it impacted the water. It hit the water heading east, nose down, right side down. Upon impact, the tailboom exploded off the rest of the airframe toward the west. The witness also recalled that the white smoke he originally saw during the climb emanated from the back of the helicopter to a distance of about 1 \u00bd boom-lengths aft of the boom, and that it dissipated once the helicopter began its descent. He also felt that there was less smoke during the climb than what he was accustomed with an RC, but enough that it originally caused the confusion as to being an RC.According to a police detective, a witness on the ground in Cata\u00f1o also saw white smoke emanating from the back of the helicopter. However, instead of the helicopter turning, he saw it swinging from side to side like a pendulum as it descended. A witness who was interviewed by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector reported that he heard the engine shut down twice, and after the second time it shut down, the helicopter descended into the water.Radar data was received from the FAA; however, due to the quality, an accurate plot of the helicopter's path could not be made. The helicopter was recovered from San Juan Bay prior to NTSB arrival, in the vicinity of 18 degrees, 26.53 minutes north latitude, 66 degrees, 07.16 minutes west longitude. The tail boom was not recovered, and is still missing as of the publication of this report.The wreckage was subsequently taken to a secure facility where it was examined. Cabin crush patterns were consistent with a nose-down, right-side-down water entry. The doors were not installed for the flight.The instrument console was found separated from the lower console, but tethered by wires. All five flight instruments had water inside of them. The keyed ignition switch was in the \"Both\" position and the rotor rpm gage indicated 76%. Other instrument indications moved as the wreckage was moved. The clutch switch was in the \"Engaged\" position, and the \"Master Battery\" and \"Alternator\" switches were in the \"On\" position.The cyclic was found jammed in the neutral position with the friction off. The collective was jammed about 2/3 of the way up with the friction off. The left tail rotor control pedal was jammed forward and the right tail rotor control pedal was jammed aft. The removable controls (in case a second pilot was onboard) were found stowed under the left seat.The fuel mixture knob was jammed in the \"Full Rich\" position, and the throttle grip was jammed in the \"Idle\" position. The carburetor heat control was jammed .20 inches up from full down (heat off) position. The carburetor heat control wire sheathing was stretched, and the mounting bracket was separated from the airbox. The carburetor heat sliding door was deformed and jammed open 1.7 inches, or about 70% heat on.Both drive V-belts remained on their sheaves and appeared undamaged. The sprag clutch was operated without any anomalies noted. The engine cooling fan was bent slightly and the upper half of the scroll sustained impact damage. The lower half of the scroll was not recovered. There was a single scuff mark on the edge of the cooling fan inlet adjacent to the scroll lip and several static contact marks on the leading edge of two of the fins. The exhaust system was bent and deformed with the tailpipe up and around the lower sheave and starter ring gear. The alternator cooling fan was deformed on one side, but with no rotational scoring noted. The alternator belt remained in position. The forward face of the upper sheave had a scuff mark adjacent to the lower frame tube. The aft face of the upper sheave had no contact marks. There were no rotational scoring marks at any contact points that would have been consistent with the engine operating at water impact.The engine did not exhibit any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Approximately 3 gallons of water and oil were drained from the oil sump. Rotating the cooling fan, crankshaft continuity was confirmed with no anomalies noted to the valve train or accessory gears. Thumb compression and suction were observed on all four cylinders. Visual examination of the rocker arms, push rods, valve caps, valve stems, valve springs and lower spark plugs revealed no anomalies. Both magnetos produced spark after internal components were dried.All oil lines and fittings were secure with no indications of the oil system being compromised. Visual inspection of the oil screen and oil filter element revealed no debris. The fuel mixture arm on the carburetor was separated from its shaft and the accelerator pump shaft was slightly bent. Carburetor removal and disassembly revealed no preexisting anomalies. The float bowl was full of liquid consistent in appearance with 100LL aviation fuel and water. The brass floats were undamaged. The gascolator bowl was also full of liquid consistent with 100LL aviator fuel and a small amount of water. Recovery personnel had also noted a fuel-type sheen on the water's surface and an odor of fuel at the crash site. The forward flex coupling was undamaged, and the intermediate flex coupling was bent and disconnected at the yoke consistent with overload. The main rotor driveshaft was rotated by hand more than 360\u00b0 with no anomalies noted. Oil was visible in the main rotor gearbox sight gauge.One main rotor blade was bent upward slightly about 7 feet from the tip, and bent downward and aft slightly about 3 feet from the tip. It had several creases running mostly chordwise from the trailing edge. The trailing edge was bent upward near the tip. There were no visible contact marks on the leading edge. The pitch control bearing rotated smoothly.The other main rotor was bowed upward at midspan. There were no visible contact marks on the leading edge although there was a scuff mark on the upper skin near the tip that appeared to be yellow paint. The paint could not be matched to specific point on the helicopter; however, the only yellow paint on it was on the main rotor blades. The pitch control bearing was rough when rotated.Both main rotor blade elastomeric teeter stops were missing, consistent with low rpm blade flapping.",

Before takeoff, the PIC calculated reference speed (Vref) for the estimated landing weight and flaps 30-degree extension was 120 knots, with a calculated landing distance of 3,440 ft. Further, before takeoff, there were no known mechanical difficulties with the brakes, flaps, antiskid, or traffic alert and collision avoidance (TCAS) systems. After takeoff and for most of the flight, the PIC coached/instructed the SIC, including instructions on how to set the airspeed command cursor, a request to perform the after-takeoff checklist, and a comment to reduce thrust to silence an overspeed warning aural annunciation. When the flight was northwest of Dekalb Peachtree Airport (PDK), Atlanta, Georgia, on a right base leg for a visual approach to runway 20L with negligible wind, air traffic controllers repeatedly announced the location and distance of a Cessna airplane (which was ahead of the Beech 400A on a straight-in visual approach to runway 20R). Because the Beech 400A flight crew did not see the other airplane, the controllers appropriately instructed them to maintain their altitude (which was 2,300 ft mean sea level [msl]) for separation until they had the traffic in sight; radar data indicated the Beech 400A briefly descended to 2,200 ft msl then climbed back to 2,300 ft msl. According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, at 1004:42, which was about 12 seconds after the controller instructed the Beech 400A flight crew to maintain altitude, the on board TCAS alerted \"traffic traffic.\" While the Beech 400A did climb back to 2,300 ft msl, this was likely a response to the air traffic control (ATC) instruction to maintain altitude and not a response to the TCAS \"traffic traffic\" warning. At 1004:47, the CVR recorded the SIC state, \"first degree of,\" likely referring to flap extension, but the comment was not completed. The CVR recorded an immediate increase in background noise, which was likely due to the landing gear extension. The PIC then advised the local controller that the flight was turning onto final approach. The CVR did not record any approach briefing or discussion of runway length or Vref speed.The PIC stated in a postaccident interview that he took control of the airplane during the base leg on approach to PDK. This likely occurred at 1005:05, when the CVR recorded the PIC state, \"let me see a second\"; however, the transfer was not explicitly verbalized. According to the CVR transcript, at 1005:08, the controller advised the Cessna pilot that the Beech 400A had just flown over his airplane, which the Cessna pilot confirmed; about that time, radar data indicated that the Beech 400A was at 2,400 ft msl, and the Cessna was at 1,800 ft msl. However, both the SIC and the PIC of the accident airplane erroneously believed the Cessna was 300 ft above them. The PIC of the accident airplane reported that because of the perceived location of the traffic conflict, he initiated a right turn and descent for the runway without seeing the Cessna and contrary to the instructions from the controller. During the approach, the enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) sounded the aural caution \"sink rate sink rate\" and also the aural warning \"pull up pull up\" several times. The CVR did not record comments from either flight crewmember about the cautions or warnings; they performed no maneuvers in response to the cautions or warnings and elected to continue the approach to the runway rather than perform a go-around, which is what they should have done after they evaluated the situation and per the Flight Manual Supplement. At the last recorded EGPWS position (.5 nautical mile [nm] from the displaced threshold and 153 ft above the displaced threshold elevation of runway 20L), the calculated groundspeed was 194 knots, and the descent rate was greater than 2,150 ft per minute.During postaccident interviews, neither flight crewmember could recall the airspeed during the approach; however, the PIC reported that he believed the airplane was high and fast on approach, which is consistent with his comment of \"way too fast\" recorded on the CVR. Witnesses, including PDK tower controllers, reported that the airplane appeared to be fast on approach, and the touchdown point on the runway was consistently reported to be about abeam the very high frequency omnidirectional range/distance measure equipment navigation aid on the airport, which allowed for about 2,970 ft of runway remaining. After touchdown, an unidentified crewmember called for deployment of the thrust reversers, and the SIC called for deployment of the speed brakes. The PIC reported applying the wheel brakes, but the airplane did not decelerate as expected. He stated that he released and then reapplied the wheel brakes with maximum force, again without effect. During a postaccident interview, he attributed the inability to stop the airplane to be a malfunction of the normal brake system; however, both passengers in the accident airplane reported hearing sounds consistent with brake application during the landing roll. Further, skid marks alternating light and dark in color were found on the runway, which are indicative of brake application and antiskid release. The airplane departed the end of the runway and came to rest about 800 ft from the departure end of the runway adjacent to the airport boundary fence. The PIC reported in a postaccident interview that after the accident, he set the airplane back to takeoff configuration.Given the observed touchdown point, the retracted flaps position, and the excessive speed during the approach, the airplane would not have been able to stop on the runway. Although the PIC reported that he positioned the flap selector to the 30-degree position during the approach and it was found in that position during the investigation, postaccident inspection of the flap system components indicated that the flaps were retracted. The CVR recorded the SIC begin a command to extend the flaps to the first notch; however, the PIC did not verbally respond to the incomplete command for flaps to be set, the before-landing checklist was not verbalized, and there was no discussion of flap position. While the speed during the final portion of the approach and at touchdown could not be determined, it is unlikely the airplane decelerated to or below the maximum 30-degree flap extension speed of 165 knots before touchdown, given that the airplane's groundspeed was 194 knots when the airplane was .5 nm from the displaced runway threshold. Further, operation of the airplane with 30 degrees of flaps extended at speeds in excess of the maximum allowable speed would have resulted in noticeable vibration; the passengers reported that they did not notice anything unusual about the flight until landing. The estimated high airspeed at landing reported by witnesses also indicated that the flaps were not extended because the flaps set in the 30 degree position would have resulted in aerodynamic deceleration. Additionally, no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction of the flap system components was noted. Therefore, the as found position of the flap selector most likely occurred after the airplane came to rest and not during flight as reported by the PIC. Calculations by the airplane manufacturer indicate that in the configuration of the airplane on approach (flaps retracted), any speed greater than 142 knots would have resulted in an inadequate distance remaining to stop the airplane from the observed touchdown point.Postaccident examination and testing of the brake and antiskid system components revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction, even though the PIC reported that the inability to stop the airplane was caused by a malfunction of the wheel brake system. Further, alternating light and dark-colored marks on the runway indicated braking action and antiskid release of brake pressure consistent with normal operation of both systems. The lack of deceleration was most likely the result of the airplane being at an excessive airspeed with the flaps retracted, rendering a light weight-on-wheels condition and, thus, reduced wheel braking. While the light weight-on-wheels condition could have prevented the deployment of the thrust reversers and speed brakes, it is also possible that the flight crew did not deploy the thrust reversers and speed brakes, despite the comments recorded on the CVR. The PIC's intentional action of setting the airplane in takeoff configuration after the accident prevented the conclusive determination of the thrust reverser and speed brake settings. The deployment of the speed brakes would have increased weight on wheels, resulting in increased braking action. In a postaccident interview, the PIC stated that he did not consider performing a go around because he did not see the Cessna that was landing on runway 20R. However, several factors should have necessitated a go-around. First, the accident airplane's excessive airspeed was characterized by both the PIC and witnesses as fast. The investigation could not determine the accident airplane's airspeed at touchdown; however, the as-found position of the horizontal stabilizer pitch trim closely matched the position it would have been set to at the last groundspeed value recorded by the EGPWS (194 knots, determined at a point .5 nm from the displaced runway threshold), which was in excess of the calculated Vref speed of 120 knots. At 1005:28, the CVR recorded the PIC state that the airplane was \"way too fast,\" indicating his awareness of the excessive airspeed. Second, the excessive rate of descent that caused the EGPWS to sound the sink rate alarm indicated an unstabilized approach. Third, Flight Manual Supplement 206 to the Airplane Flight Manual states that when an aural \"pull up\" warning occurs, the flight crew should level the wings, add maximum power, increase pitch to 15 degrees nose up, retract flaps if extended, and climb at the best angle of climb speed. The flight crew did not take these actions in response to the warning. Finally, the runway distance remaining (of about 2,970 ft) at the touchdown point was inadequate for the airplane to stop based on the PIC's preflight calculations and postaccident calculations. Based on the airplane configuration at touchdown, any speed greater than 142 knots would have resulted in a landing overrun. While the PIC recognized the excessive airspeed, neither pilot responded to the excessive airspeed, excessive rate of descent, the EGPWS system alarms, or the insufficient runway remaining to land and called for a go around, even though the airplane had sufficient altitude and airspeed to safely do so.The flight crew also demonstrated poor crew resource management (CRM), evidenced by poor communication, lack of crew monitoring, and lack of situation awareness. Regarding poor communication, the PIC's statement of \"let me see a second\" likely indicated the point when he took control of the airplane from the SIC and deviated from the standard \"my airplane\" transfer of control command. Further, the flight crew's actions while on the base leg, including the flight crew's failure to adhere to instructions from air traffic controllers not to descend until the Cessna traffic was in sight, show a lack of crew monitoring and cross-checking between the PIC and SIC, important concepts of CRM to ensure the highest levels of safety. Although the SIC reminded the PIC that they were not to descend, the PIC did not respond, and the SIC briefly descended then returned to the appropriate altitude. Further, the PIC and SIC both exhibited poor situation awareness throughout the accident flight. First, they were not able to accurately visualize their position in relation to the Cessna, despite repeated communication from the controller announcing the location and altitude of the Cessna. The PIC and SIC apparently did not realize that the tower transmission to the Cessna of \"five eight echo that previous traffic's a mile off your right side [2,300 msl] indicated\" was a reference to them since they were at the altitude the transmission described. Second, the on board TCAS issued an audible and visual alert regarding the Cessna, but neither the PIC nor the SIC was able to accurately determine the Cessna's altitude and location despite the information that the TCAS and ATC provided. This lack of situation awareness was likely caused by the SIC's lack of proficiency in the airplane during the accident flight. His lack of proficiency (evidenced by his inability to locate and set the airspeed command cursor, his failure to perform the after-takeoff checklist, the overspeed warning exceedance after takeoff, and his inability to get the vertical speed command to work during the descent) led the PIC to coach/instruct him for most of the flight, which likely distracted the PIC from his pilot monitoring duties, reducing his situation awareness.Further, the flight crewmembers demonstrated unprofessional behavior, evidenced by a lack of checklist usage. The SIC's lack of experience in the make and model airplane demanded extra vigilance regarding the use of checklists, which did not occur. Before departure, the CVR did not record the use of a before-takeoff checklist; the CVR recorded the pilots stating some individual pre-takeoff items but not as part of a clear challenge/response checklist. In addition, the approach and before-landing checklists and the transfer of control of the airplane from the SIC to the PIC were not explicitly verbalized. Further, the SIC asked for the descent checklist, to which the PIC responded, \"hang on a second\"; the complete checklist was not verbalized, and there was no challenge and response. Although not required for Part 91 flights, checklists are universally recognized as basic safe aviation practices.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight crew's failure to obtain the proper airspeed for landing, which resulted in the airplane touching down too fast with inadequate runway remaining to stop and a subsequent runway overrun. Contributing to the accident were the failure of either pilot to call for a go-around and the flight crew's poor crew resource management and lack of professionalism."

When the pilot was about 30 nautical miles from his destination, the oil pressure needle was pegged on the high side of the indicator.  He closed the throttle, and the oil pressure appeared to return to normal.  Then, the oil pressure needle fell to zero and the oil temperature began to rise.  He prepared to land on a road; however, on short final he could not maintain directional control and alignment with the road due to a crosswind condition.  He turned the airplane into the wind and landed in a desert field.  Post accident examination revealed that the main crankshaft seal was extruded outward and oil was pumped out during the flight.  Approximately 1.5 quarts of oil were drained from the engine prior to its teardown. The engine manufacturer's representative examined the engine crankcase, crankshaft nose seal, and breather tube on January 24, 2005.  The seal bore exhibited witness marks indicating that the seal had been occupying the bore properly.  In addition, the corresponding witness marks on the crankshaft where the seal had been in contact indicated that the seal had been positioned correctly.  The engine breather tube extended from the firewall area, aft to the trailing edge of the right main landing gear strut, which was inconsistent with breather tube length.  The breather tube did not have a whistle slot installed.  The airplane was originally a show airplane.  The breather tube was designed to drain in a way that would prevent oil and moisture from draining onto the airplane.  However, due to its nonstandard design, the end of the tube was susceptible to icing.  An edition of the Lycoming Flyer stated the following, in part:  \"Under very cold conditions, this moisture may freeze and continue a buildup of ice until the tube is completely blocked.  It is normal practice for the airframe manufacturer to provide some means of preventing freeze-up of the crankcase breather tube.  The breather tube may be insulated, it may be designed so the end is located in a hot area, it may be equipped with an electric heater, or it may incorporate a hole, notch or slot which is often called a \"whistle slot.\"  When a breather tube with whistle slot is changed, the new tube must be of the same design.\"",
            "probable_cause": "oil exhaustion due to an improper oil breather tube installation, which became plugged in flight due to frozen moisture build-up.  The blocked breather tube then created a crankcase over pressure that caused a failure of the crankshaft seal.  The rough, uneven terrain and strong crosswind were factors in the accident."

As the airplane was in cruise flight about 500 feet above the ground, the engine surged about three to four times.  The pilot activated the electric fuel boost pump, and switched fuel tanks, even though each fuel tank contained adequate fuel. The engine quit, and the pilot selected an emergency landing area in soft, marshy terrain.  The airplane received damage to the nose gear, the engine firewall, the left landing gear, the right landing gear, and the right wing.  A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the engine had accrued about 500 hours since an overhaul.  Each fuel tank contained fuel.  The electric fuel pump produced pressure.  Opening of the throttle produced only a momentary increase in fuel pressure.  After several attempts, the engine started and ran at an idle.  The engine maintenance records indicated the engine driven fuel pump had been replaced twice since the overhaul.  Each fuel pump installed on the engine by the operator since the engine overhaul was tested for proper operation.  Each produced fuel pressure.  The engine fuel servo was removed and tested for proper operation.  During fuel flow testing, the fuel servo produced a lean fuel mixture at a mid-range power setting.  The servo, bearing the overhaul facilities coil loc lead seal, was disassembled after the flow check.  The examination revealed the brass idle plug/main metering valve had part number 2541461 stamped on opposite sides of the vertical surface of the valve.  One of the part numbers had been obliterated by a marking tool, and the number 2537665 etched on the valve with a hand marking tool.  Part number 2537665 is the correct component for the model of servo.  The valve appeared to a hand modified 2541461 which has a different metering jet placement than that of the correct 2537665 valve.

The sport pilot was the flying pilot and the student pilot assumed navigational duties during the flight. They had been using a global positioning system receiver for the flight. When they arrived at the destination airport, the sport pilot twice overflew the runway. There had been a discussion between the pilots regarding the location of the runway. The sport pilot then established an approach to a recently plowed agricultural field located about 250 yards west of the runway and landed on that field.

The airplane then taxied onto runway 29 left for takeoff. The wind was from the east, making the takeoff with a tail wind. During the takeoff, the engine seemed to operate at a steady level, but appeared to be low on power. The flight lifted off about halfway down the runway and the landing gear was retracted. The airplane climbed slowly and turned slowly to the left. The airplane then entered a 60-80 degree left bank followed by the airplane rolling level and the wings rocking back and forth. The airplane was now on a southerly heading and the nose dropped. The airplane then collided with trees about 15-20 feet above the ground, fell to the ground, and burst into flames. Witnesses stated they saw no smoke or flames coming from the airplane prior to impact with the trees. At the time of the accident the landing gear was retracted and the engine was running. Transcripts of recorded communications show that at 1205:40, the local controller instructed the flight to taxi into position and hold on runway 29 left. At 1206:43, N262MM was cleared for takeoff and a north bound departure was approved. At 1208:03, the passenger transmitted \"we need to land we have to turn around\". The local controller cleared the flight to return to the airport when able. At 1208:20, the passenger transmitted \"two mike mike we're going down we're going down\", followed by \"over the golf (unintelligible)\". The local controller responded \"copy over the golf course\". No further transmissions were received from the flight. Analysis of background noise contained on the ATC recordings show that at the time the passenger on N262MM transmitted to controllers that they were ready for takeoff and when he acknowledged the takeoff clearance, the propeller was rotating at 1,261 and 1,255 respectively. When the passenger transmitted to controllers after takeoff, that they needed to land, the propeller was rotating at 1,980 rpm. When the passenger transmitted we have to turn around, shortly after the above transmission, the propeller was rotating at 2,017 rpm. When the passenger made his last transmission stating they were going down, the propeller rpm was 1,965. The maximum propeller speed at takeoff is 2,000 rpm. Additional evidence was found indicating electrical arcing and progressive fatigue cracking in the engine\u2019s P3 line, which could result in a rapid rollback of engine power. Simulator testing showed that a P3 line failure would result in the engine decelerating from full takeoff power (2,000 propeller rpm) and stabilizing at an idle power setting in less than 9 seconds. However, the sound spectrum analysis of the first radio transmission indicated the propeller rpm was 1,980, and two subsequent radio transmissions, the last of which was made 17 seconds after the initial transmission, detected the propeller rpm at near takeoff speed. Thus, there was no evidence of dramatic rpm loss, making the P3 line failure an unlikely cause of the accident. Postcrash examination of the aircraft structure, flight controls, engine, and propeller, showed no evidence of failure or malfunction. Witnesses indicated the flight used about 3,650 feet of runway for takeoff or about half of the 7,296 foot long runway. Charts contained in the Piper PA-46-500TP, Pilot's Operating Handbook, indicated that for the conditions at the time of the accident, the airplane should have used about 2,000 feet of runway for the ground roll during the takeoff with no wing flaps extended. The charts also show that the airplane indicated stall speed at 60 degrees of bank angle with the landing gear and wing flaps retracted is 111 knots.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's excessive bank angle and his failure to maintain airspeed while returning to the airport after takeoff due to an unspecified problem resulting in the airplane stalling and colliding with trees during the resultant uncontrolled descent."

The airplane was registered to and being operated by Unmanned Systems, Inc under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The certified flight instructor was fatally injured and the airplane was destroyed. The personal flight departed from Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, Phoenix, Arizona about 1815 with a planned destination of Hesperia Airport, Hesperia, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed and activated.During the month prior to the accident, the pilot had spent a majority of his time based in Phoenix to work on the development of hardware/software upgrades systems for the Lancair Evolution. The pilot had been planning to take the airplane to pick up his four children in Hesperia and return back to Phoenix where they would stay with him for the week. He had to delay his flight because the flight line personnel at the fixed based operator (FBO), where he hangared the airplane, had left the master switch on and the batteries were completely drained.Air Traffic Control (ATC) communication audiotapes from the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center (ABQ ARTCC) were provided to the National Transportation Safety Board for review. Following departure, the pilot contacted ABQ ARTCC at 1825, indicating he was at 18,100 ft and climbing to flight level (FL)210. The controller read back that he was cleared to climb and maintain FL250, which is the FL listed in the pilot's flight plan. At 1829 the pilot made his last radio transmission which was a response to the controller's frequency change instructions. The pilot read back the frequency and did not make further contact. The controller checked to see if he was on the frequency about 5 minutes later, but did not receive a response.Preliminary radar data indicated that following departure, the airplane made a continuous climb until reaching FL250. At the time of the first radio call, the airplane did appear to be transitioning through 18,100 ft, consistent with the pilot's transmission. During the pilot's last radio call, about 4 minutes later, the airplane was climbing through 22,800 ft continuing on a westerly heading. While tracking jet route J212, the airplane passed over the waypoint CURIV and at about 1850 began, a turn to the south-southwest to overfly the Blythe, California very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR). Completing an s-turn, the airplane passed over way point DECAS and continued west tracking jet route J65 overflying the destination airport and continuing on that heading until descending into the ocean. The airplane floated intact for over 20 minutes before becoming submerged in the water.According US military representatives, two F-15 fighter jets and a KC-135 air refueling tanker intercepted the airplane near Fresno, California around 1900.

The pilot made an emergency landing in an open field where the airplane collided with a ditch on the landing rollout and nosed over inverted. Examination of the engine by an FAA inspector revealed that when the No. 2 upper spark plug was removed it had foreign object damage. A compression check was performed and the No. 2 cylinder had no compression. The crankshaft was rotated and gear and valve train continuity was established. The No. 2 cylinder was removed from the engine case and examination of the cylinder assembly revealed that the exhaust and intake valves were broken. A review of the engine logbook revealed that the new Superior cylinders were installed on December 12, 2000, and had a total operation time of 272 hours since the installation. The No. 2 cylinder, exhaust, intake valves, and piston were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Material Laboratory for further examination. The valves from the No. 2 cylinder were disassembled and visually inspected. The exhaust fracture faces were so heavily damaged by post separation impacts that no original fracture features could be found. The fractures on the intake valve head were only slightly damaged with features consistent with overstress fracturing consistent with low temperature impact loading, secondary to the fracture of the exhaust valve.",

The pilot stated as he pressed the push to talk (PTT) button on the cyclic control, the \"engine had a flame out.\"  Due to obstacles in the flight path of the helicopter, the pilot was forced to turn the helicopter and \"attempt a landing on a downhill slope.\"  During the landing, the turbine powered helicopter nosed over and came to rest on its right side.  During a telephone interview, the pilot reported to the NTSB investigator-in-charge that he was having problems with the radio and installed a new one prior to departing.  The pilot stated that after takeoff he pressed the PTT and it \"caused the ignition system to go out.\"",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the engine ignition system for undetermined reasons resulting in a loss of engine power.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for an auto rotational landing."

ALTITUDE COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED AND THE PILOT SELECTED A ROLLING OPEN FIELD IN WHICH TO LAND WHEN HE REALIZED THAT REACHING AN AIRPORT SEVEN MILES SOUTH WAS IMPROBABLE. DURING THE LANDING ROLL A STEEP INCLINE WAS ENCOUNTERED THAT COLLAPSED THE NOSE GEAR AND THE ACFT SLID. THE TEMPERATURE AND DEW POINT INDICATED THAT CONDITIONS WERECONDUCIVE TO THE FORMATION OF CARBURETOR ICE. THE PLT STATED THAT HE DID NOT APPLY CARB HEAT BECAUSE HE FELT THAT LIST IN THE PILOT'S OPERATING HANDBOOK DOES NOT INCLUDE THE APPLICATION OF CARB HEAT.
