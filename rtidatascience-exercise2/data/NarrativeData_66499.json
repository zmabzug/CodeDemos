After completing the landing checklist the captain observed the main landing gear position indicator lights were illuminated indicating that the main landing gear was down and locked. The nose gear position indicator light was illuminated indicating that the nose gear was unlocked, and the hydraulic system was still operating. The captain aborted the approach, and executed a go-around. During the go-around the hydraulic caution lights illuminated. The captain contacted the Beaufort approach to advise them of the situation. The captain then requested to fly by the Beaufort control tower to visually confirm the nose landing gear position. The control tower confirmed the main landing gear was extended and the nose gear was retracted. The captain declared an emergency, and was given radar vectors, and diverted to Savannah International Airport, where an emergency landing on runway 9 was performed. Post-examination of the airplane revealed, the nose wheel doors were scraped and the nose wheel tire was blown. The pilot did not report any flight control malfunctions. A total of eighteen laboratory physical tests, a kinematic study, several general inspections, and a conformity check were conducted in an effort to duplicate the condition that occurred on 560-5132. Seven tests were preformed on a nose gear assembly from a Cessna test article. Eleven tests were performed on the nose ear assembly from 560-5132, including leak tests and service procedure tests.

The pilot said he configured and checked the airplane prior to takeoff with 10 degrees of flaps and all gages \"in the green.\"  The pilot stated that he had leaned the engine during the taxi and takeoff.  His procedure for leaning was to bring the mixture back until the engine began to run rough, and then turn the mixture control knob two times until the engine was running smoothly again.  As the airplane climbed out, the engine was not developing enough power, and the pilot initiated a shallow turn toward the runway.  The pilot verified that the throttle and propeller were forward and richened the mixture two turns; however, at that point the airplane lost all of its ability to climb.  He executed a forced landing in the desert, shearing the nose gear and one of the main landing gear and bending the propeller blades.  Passengers thought the engine sounded normal, but not like it was running at full rpm during the initial climb.

When asked by the FSS if he wanted a weather briefing or Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) the pilot declined. According to the FSS personnel, the pilot did not receive the vital weather information that called for icing along the route of flight. Two pilot reports were documented before the accident time with moderate icing conditions reported. According to the pilot-in-command (PIC), he and the pilot-rated passenger had reviewed the weather from computer sources. The PIC determined that an en route area of low pressure would have prevented them from reaching their final destination that day. The PIC noted that the low pressure area would be moving into their current area, Halifax, the following day, so he and the passenger decided to depart Halifax for Saint John, New Brunswick, where they would stay until the weather associated with the front had passed. The flight departed and reached a cruising altitude of 6,000 feet. During the flight, the passenger advised the PIC that ice had formed on the left wing, and the PIC observed the same on the right wing. The PIC described the accumulation as no thicker than a nickel at that point. The PIC requested a lower altitude, and a Montreal air traffic controller authorized a descent to 5,200 feet. The PIC told the controller that they were still experiencing icing and needed to descend to a lower altitude. During the descent, the PIC recalled that the airplane experienced the most ice he had ever seen in his life and that the canopy had completely frozen over. He described the ice as being as large as a house brick on the leading edge, extending back on the wing for 1 foot, and about 1 or 2 inches thick on the wing. The pilot observed that the airspeed was 84 knots and the airplane was buffeting in straight and level flight with full power. Ice continued to accumulate on the airplane, and the PIC advised the passenger to start looking for somewhere to land. The pilot estimated that they were about 1,000 feet above ground level while the airplane continued buffeting. The next thing that the PIC remembered was waking up in the airplane, next to the pilot-rated passenger, with no recollection of how long he was unconscious.

The airplane was being operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) local flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 when the accident occurred. The private pilot was fatally injured, and the sole passenger sustained serious injuries. Dark night, visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight departed Merrill Field Airport, Anchorage, Alaska, about 0202.Based on information provided by a family member of the pilot, he had been in Anchorage for a social visit, and would have been returning home to Big Lake when the accident occurred.  According to witnesses, the accident pilot and his passenger were seen at local bar in Anchorage, during the early morning hours of August 10. Various bar patrons reported that both the accident pilot, and his female passenger, left the bar about 0119 on August 10. Archived surveillance video, which was provided to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), confirmed the witness's accounts.  An initial review of archived Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar data revealed that, on August 10, about 0202, an unidentified aircraft, believed to be the accident airplane, departed from the Merrill Field Airport. After departure, the radar track proceeded north, towards the Big Lake Airport. As the track approached the Big Lake Airport, it turned west, and appeared to pass over the airport. After passing over the airport in a westerly direction, the track turns 180 degrees back to the airport. The track subsequently disappeared about the time of the accident.     The NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) along with another NTSB investigator reached the accident site on the morning of August 10. The initial impact point was marked by two broken treetops, atop 40-foot tall birch trees, located about 50 feet south of the extended runway centerline and 830 feet from the threshold of runway 7.  The airplane impacted in a nose low attitude and came to rest upright in an area of gravel-covered terrain alongside a road adjacent to the airport. An on-scene documentation of the wreckage was completed, and a detailed wreckage examination is pending. During the on-scene wreckage examination, the NTSB IIC recovered a portable global positioning system (GPS) receiver that was capable of storing track and altitude data. The unit was sent to the NTSB's Vehicle Recorders Division for a preliminary examination that revealed the accident flight departed MRI about 0202. After departure, the airplane proceeded north before it turned west, toward the Big Lake airport, and made a straight-in approach to runway 25. As the airplane passed over the threshold of runway 25, the airplane began to climb, and it continued west for about 1 mile before making a 180-degree left turn in the direction of runway 7. A detailed NTSB examination of the archived GPS data is pending. The closest weather reporting facility is Wasilla Airport, Wasilla, AK, about 9 miles east of the accident site.

There were indications that the lower rudder moved to the left blowdown limit, and remained there.  Emergency procedures failed to correct the problem, and the flight diverted to the nearest airport for an emergency landing.  As the airspeed decreased during the approach, the lower rudder deflected further to the left.  The flightcrew used asymmetric engine thrust to maintain heading.  After landing, the lower rudder remained deflected fully to the left, and could not be repositioned until the hydraulic pressure was relieved.   An inspection of the forged aluminum manifold of the lower rudder power control module (PCM) revealed the end portion which houses the yaw damper actuator had fractured off from the main portion of the manifold.   The lower rudder PCM and the flight data recorder (FDR) were sent to the NTSB laboratory.  The data retrieved from the FDR showed an initial lower rudder deflection of 17.5 degrees left, and a subsequent increase to 32 degrees (full) left.  The incident airplane has two independently supported and operated rudders, which provide yaw control.  Typically, the upper and lower rudders operate in unison.  The hydraulic actuators for the lower and upper rudders are controlled by independent power control modules.  The power control modules for both the upper and lower rudders are virtually identical.  The fractured power control module was disassembled and inspected.  The yaw damper piston was protruding from the fracture, and precluded functional testing of the module.  The individual components of the power control module were tested, and no anomalies were found.  Dimensional checks showed no discrepancies, and metallurgical testing showed the manifold material was consistent with the manufacturer's specifications.  Metallurgical examination revealed a mode of crack initiation and growth consistent with fatigue.  A non-destructive inspection process was developed, and a group of similar power control modules were inspected.  The group contained power control modules with higher and lower use cycles than the incident airplane's power control module.  No similar fractures were found.   As a result of this incident, the airplane's manufacturer has issued an Alert Service Bulletin which recommends operators perform an ultrasonic inspection on pertinent high-time lower and upper rudder power control modules.  The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making for a airworthiness directive which would make the ultrasonic inspection mandatory for all affected airplanes.      ",

After a rolling out for a short while in corn the landing gear became stuck in corn and soft sandy soil.\"  A portion of the remaining blade, including the separation, was shipped to the NTSB's Materials Laboratory Division.  The laboratory's report stated that \"a large portion of the fracture surface was on a 90-degree flat plane with multiple ratchet marks and crack arrest marks on this portion of the fracture surface.  These features are typical of a fatigue crack.  The fatigue crack originated from multiple origins at the bottom of a gouge on the flat face of the blade about 2.25 inches from the blade's leading edge.  The fatigue crack extended through about two-thirds of the blade's cross-section.  The remainder of the fracture surface (about one-third of the blade's cross section) was on a 45-degree slanted plane and was typical of an overstress region stemming from the fatigue crack.\"  A section was saw cut from the fracture containing the fatigue origin.  The paint was removed from the areas near the crack origin and the surface was re-examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).  The gouge was measured using the SEM.

That impact threw the airplane sideways, whereupon it collided with more of the previously plowed and hardened snow, resulting in the collapse of all the landing gear struts. The investigation determined that the last time that the runway was plowed, the snow had not been cleared all the way to the edge of the runway's paved surface, and there was therefore piles of previously plowed snow on the outer portions of the runway surface. Some of that snow was located 10 to 12 feet inboard of the edge of the runway surface. When the new snow fell, it became very hard to distinguish between the area where the previously cleared surface was covered only by the newly fallen snow, and the area where the chunks of previously plowed snow had piled up, hardened, and then been covered by the new snow. The pilot departed the same airport two days before the accident, and had seen the condition of the partially plowed runway. When he returned for landing on the day of the accident, he assumed that the old snow had been cleared away prior to the new snow falling, and that the entire runway was then covered only with the two to three inches of freshly fallen snow. Because he made that assumption, the pilot did not take advantage of the opportunity to perform a low approach and inspect the entire runway surface prior to landing. Soon after the airplane touched down, the pilot realized that the previously plowed snow was still on the edges of the runway, and that he had not touched down on the centerline. The pilot saw the chunks of snow-covered old snow prior to the impact, but before he could take remedial action, one of the airplane's main gear collided with a chunk of hardened old snow, and the accident sequence was initiated.

The captain also commented about the right pack \"misbehaving\", and a bleed valve failure warning.  The captain also commented about aborting below 80 knots for everything, except for the bleed shutoff valve.   During the takeoff roll, a single chime was heard, and the first officer reported a bleed valve fail message.  The captain responded, \"ignore it.\"  Another chime was heard, and the first officer reported \"lateral mode fail, pusher fail.\"  The captain asked about airspeed and  was advised of an \"indicated airspeed miscompare.\"  The captain initiated the aborted takeoff approximately 13 seconds after the second chime was heard.  The crew was unable to stop the airplane, and it went off the end of the runway, and impacted obstructions and terrain.  According to the flight data recorder, peak groundspeed was 152 knots and the time the aborted takeoff was initiated, and indicated airspeed was 78.5 knots.  The captain and the airplane owner's director of maintenance were aware of several mechanical discrepancies prior to the flight, and the captain had advised the first officer that the flight was for \"routine maintenance,\" but that the airplane was airworthy.  Prior to the flight the first officer found \"reddish clay\" in one of the pitot tubes and removed it.  A mechanic and the captain examined the pitot tube, and determined the tube was not obstructed.  The captain's pitot tube was later found to be partially blocked with an insect nest.  A postaccident examination of the airplane and aircraft maintenance log revealed that no discrepancies were entered in the log, and no placards or \"inoperative\" decals were affixed in the cockpit.",
            "probable_cause": "The partially blocked pitot system, which resulted in an inaccurate airspeed indicator display, and an overrun during an aborted takeoff.  A factor associated with the accident was the pilot-in-command's delayed decision to abort the takeoff."

Analysis of the radar information, the flight condition of both airplanes, and the pilots' visibility in their respective cockpit configurations, suggests that until just prior to the impact, the Piper would have been located below the horizon and against the background of the surrounding terrain and city, between the 10 and 11 o\u2019clock position of the Cirrus pilot. The Piper remained in this same relative position in the windscreen of the Cirrus pilot for the entire duration of its 7 minute flight. The Cirrus would have been above the horizon, against the white overcast sky, in about the 1 to 2 o\u2019clock position of the Piper pilot. The Cirrus would have only appeared in this position after the Piper pilot completed the last turn and was headed to the west, which would have been (at most) the last 3 minutes of the flight. Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time of the accident with an overcast layer and visibility of 8 miles. The overcast sky conditions likely made it difficult for the Piper pilot to detect the primarily white-colored Cirrus. The lack of maneuvering, as observed by the glider pilot prior to the accident, suggests that neither the pilot of the Cirrus nor the pilot of the Piper observed the other airplane prior to the accident. If the Piper pilot had observed the Cirrus prior to the impact, his ability to maneuver to avoid an impact would have been severely limited due to the glider in tow. A postaccident examination of the engine and flight control systems on both airplanes revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have prevented either pilot from maneuvering to avoid an impact. Medical and pathological examination of both pilots revealed no medical or toxicological issues that would have precluded either pilot from operating their airplane in a safe manner prior to the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of both pilots to see and avoid the other resulting in a midair collision. Contributing to the accident was the lack of perceived visual relative motion of the Piper and the Cirrus to the pilot of each airplane, the terrain background, and the overcast weather conditions making it difficult for either pilot to visually acquire the other aircraft."

After all the jumpers had exited, the pilot decided to do a power off stall.  He stated that he was 'curious about the gliding abilities of the 182' and pulled the mixture control to idle cutoff when the aircraft was over the airport at 11,500 feet.  During the stall maneuver the propeller stopped rotating.  The pilot glided down in an orbit over the airport to 5,000 feet before trying to start the engine.  All subsequent engine restart efforts during the descent were unsuccessful and he decided to land on runway 32 because the winds were from 330 degrees when he departed.  The pilot said that once on final approach he saw that he was high and fast, then noticed that the windsock indicated a tailwind. The pilot attempted to use flaps and a prolonged slip; however, the aircraft floated down the entire length of the 3,550-foot-long runway.  The aircraft finally touched down on the nose gear 280 feet beyond the runway's departure end.  The nose gear collapsed and the aircraft nosed over.

Shortly thereafter, a passenger got into the back seat, and the pilot took off with a 5- to 10-knot tailwind. A witness heard a \u201cfunny metallic sound\u201d before the engine sustained a complete loss of power a few seconds later. The aircraft then glided for 5 to 10 seconds before it turned sharply to the left in what appeared to be an attempt to do a 180-degree turn to land back on the runway. The aircraft then turned again sharply to the left, dived at an approximate 45-degree angle toward the displaced threshold of the runway, and impacted the ground. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that it had sustained a cold seizure, which is indicative that the engine had been running with too lean of a fuel/air mixture before the accident. (A cold seizure occurs when the piston expands faster than the cylinder and the clearance between the piston and cylinder is reduced.)The maintenance records contained no entries related to such items as carburetor readjustments and checks that were required by the engine manufacturer to be accomplished as part of the maintenance schedule. Further examination of the maintenance records revealed that the engine had previously suffered a cold seizure and a broken piston ring. Also, 2 months before the accident, the cylinder heads were replaced with cylinder heads of an older design that had accumulated 125 hours of operation, but the gearbox and carburetors were reused. The engine then accrued another 4 hours of operation prior to the final cold seizure that preceded the accident. The airport was surrounded by wooded terrain and water. Departing with a tailwind increases an aircraft\u2019s takeoff roll and decreases its climb angle, resulting in less altitude gain over distance traveled. Thus, the pilot\u2019s decision to depart with a tailwind reduced his remedial options available following the loss of engine power because the aircraft was at a lower altitude over unsuitable landing terrain and farther from the runway than it would have been if the pilot had departed into a headwind.",

After checking the \"gear down\" light, which illuminated when pushed, the pilot reached the conclusion that the problem was most likely a bad gear position indicator switch, which was a problem he had experienced before. The pilot then considered cycling the landing gear, but decided not to do so in case there was something broken in the system that might result in the right main gear remaining up once it was retracted. He then executed an uneventful landing and rollout, which included slowing to his normal taxi speed. At that point he turned off the runway onto the taxiway, and as he began to straighten the airplane to follow the taxiway centerline, the right main gear to folded back, causing the right wing to impacted the taxiway. A postaccident inspection determined that the right main gear upper side link (over-center lock) had not moved fully to its locked position, and that the side-loads generated by the turn to align with the taxiway were transferred to the gear activation system. The transfer of those loads then resulted in the overload failure of the right main gear strut-mounted bellcrank.

The pilot calculated that there would be 4 gallons of reserve fuel remaining following a 2-hour flight at a fuel burn of 8 gallons per hour.  The airplane was equipped with two main fuel tanks which had a total fuel capacity of 42 gallons, of which 38 gallons were unusable.  Federal Aviation Administration publication, FAA-P-8740-03 states that a \"safe flight time\" is based upon multiplying the usable fuel on board by 75% and dividing that result by the previously confirmed consumption rate.

The airplane was equipped with a Stormscope, but not weather radar.  The pilot received a preflight weather briefing that included advisories for icing conditions, scattered thunderstorms, and moderate to severe turbulence.  The briefer advised that radar indicated a large area of echoes extended over the route of flight with light to moderate intensities and that cloud tops were up to 24,000 feet with scattered thunderstorms and a high likelihood of icing conditions between 15,000 and 24,000 feet.  The pilot filed his IFR flight plan with a cruising altitude of 17,000 feet.  After takeoff and achieving 17,000 feet, the pilot asked the center controller for a clearance to a higher altitude of 19,000 feet, which was approved.  Within the next 3 minutes the pilot made a request to deviate to the left and then to climb higher  to  21,000  feet, which were all approved.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot had previously owned the accident airplane about 22 years ago, and it was subsequently modified under a supplemental type certificate (STC) that installed vortex generators (VGs), which decreased the airplane\u2019s air minimum control airspeed (Vmca) from 81 knots to 74 knots. Another subsequent STC modification, STC SA1762SO, installed more powerful engines, different propellers, winglets, and modified engine nose cowlings. STC SA1762SO took into account a change to only the original type design and increased the airplane\u2019s Vmca to 87 knots; however, the airplane\u2019s airspeed indicator remained marked to indicate a Vmca of 74 knots. A representative of the current holder of STC SA1762SO reported that, to his knowledge, no flight testing was performed on the accident airplane or any similar make and model airplane to determine the interrelationship between his company\u2019s STC and the previous STC. Therefore, the actual performance data for the accident airplane, including the Vmca, were unknown. However, the Vmca for the accident airplane was likely higher than the 74-knot Vmca marked on the airspeed indicator.The pilot purchased the airplane 4 days before the accident and performed three full-stop landings 2 days before the accident to get current. An individual familiar with the pilot believed that the pilot had not previously flown a reciprocating-engine-equipped airplane in about 3 years. Due to the pilot\u2019s recent purchase, an insurance company broker \u201csuggested\u201d that the pilot obtain a multiengine instrument proficiency checkride; a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) designated pilot examiner acting as a certified flight instructor (CFI) was on board for the accident flight. The CFI did not have an exemption from 14 Code of Federal Regulations 91.109(a) to give instruction in an aircraft equipped with a throw-over control yoke.According to uncorrelated radar data, after departure, the flight proceeded north-northwest and climbed to 3,600 feet where two 360-degree nearly level turns to the left were made, followed by a 360-degree turn to the right. The airplane then proceeded north-northwest and climbed to 4,200 feet briefly with the ground speed decreasing to 127 knots, then it descended to 3,900 feet and remained at that altitude, at which heading changes occurred, and the ground speed decreased to about 71 knots. Witnesses reported seeing the airplane flying level before it descended in a left spin and impacted a house. The only major components of the airplane that were not extensively heat damaged consisted of the outer section of the left wing and one cargo door, both of which were found in close proximity to the house. Both engines and their accessories and both propellers were extensively heat damaged. Although the right engine-driven fuel pump drive coupling was found fractured, this likely occurred during postaccident rotation of the crankshaft in order to facilitate removal of the propeller. The extent of the heat and impact damage to the airplane limited the airframe and engine testing that could be performed; however, there was no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction on the observed components.Based on the airplane\u2019s decreasing airspeed and nearly level altitude, the pilot was likely performing either imminent stall or simulated loss of engine power airwork before the airplane aerodynamically stalled and then entered a spin. Because the airplane was equipped with only a throw-over control yoke, the CFI had limited ability to assist in the recovery of the airplane. Although it was not possible to determine which low-airspeed maneuver was being demonstrated, one scenario that is consistent with the radar data evidence (and is typically performed during multiengine checkrides) is the Vmca demonstration, which requires a power reduction on one engine(and is consistent with the witnesses' descriptions of \"sputtering\" engine sounds). If the pilot were performing a Vmca demonstration, it is possible that the airplane began to lose directional control earlier than expected because the actual Vmca of the airplane with multiple STC modifications was unknown, and the airspeed indicator was improperly marked. Although the limitations and conditions section of STC SA1762SO stated that the installer must determine that the relationship between that STC modification and any other previously approved modifications \u201cwill not produce an adverse effect upon the airworthiness of that airplane,\u201d the investigation found that the FAA does not provide any guidance to an installer to help determine the interrelationship between multiple STCs. As a result of this accident, on December 29, 2011, the FAA issued Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2011-27-04 that requires an inspection for airplanes equipped with STC SA1762SO and that specifies corrective action, if applicable, to ensure that the airplanes have the correct Vmca marking on the airspeed indicator, taking into consideration other STC modifications. AD 2011-27-04 is available from the FAA\u2019s website at .",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s loss of control of the airplane during low-airspeed airwork and his failure to promptly recover the airplane from the aerodynamic stall, which resulted in a spin. Contributing to the accident were the pilot and certified flight instructor\u2019s intentional operation of the airplane for the purpose of performing instructional airwork with only a throw-over control yoke installed and the pilot\u2019s lack of recent flight experience in the airplane make and model. Contributing to the lack of accurate performance data (including the air minimum control airspeed) for the modified airplane was the lack of guidance by the Federal Aviation Administration for an installer of a supplemental type certificate (STC) modification to determine the interrelationship between all STCs incorporated into an aircraft."

She retarded the throttle to idle, lowered full flaps, and slipped the aircraft to land as expeditiously as possible; and then steered the aircraft into small trees and brush to avoid going over an embankment. Post-crash examination revealed all 3 bosses of the #3 cylinder broken, thus rendering the intake/exhaust valves permanently closed.  Metallurgical examination revealed that the separation of the rocker arm shaft bosses was initiated by fatigue cracking in the boss located adjacent to the exhaust valve.  Further  examination revealed the presence of heavy tool marks on the bore surface of all three bosses.  The heavy manual cutting of the bore surface is not authorized by the engine manufacturer and the surface created by this procedure did not meet the engine manufacturer requirements for surface finish in the bore of the bosses.

Upon touchdown, the aircraft veered left of the centerline.  The private pilot attempted to brake with right rudder input.  The aircraft slowed down but continued to veer to the left.  The propellers were put into beta, but the aircraft continued to veer off the left side of the runway, struck a light, and collapsed the nose gear.  After repairs, the airline transport pilot ferried the aircraft to an airport in California, with no discrepancies noted.

He expected a flight duration of about 2.5 hours and wanted to land at the destination airport before dark. The departure was delayed about 15 to 20 minutes due to a problem at the fuel facility. Because of the departure delay, the pilot kept the engine rpm at a higher setting and leaned the fuel-air mixture during the climb. During cruise flight, he leaned the fuel-to-air mixture using the onboard exhaust gas temperature gauge, then slightly enriched the mixture. He reported that the fuel quantity indicator installed on the instrument panel was working but that he was not entirely clear at what level the gauge indicated empty.

The first error occurred at 1614 eastern daylight time when the tower controller cleared an aircraft for a low approach to a closed runway without providing an altitude restriction and the second error occurred about 10 minutes later when another aircraft landed on the same closed runway.  At the time of the incidents, there were four controllers assigned to the facility.  Two certified air traffic controllers were in the tower cab:  one controller working radar approach control/flight data combined at the approach control position, one controller working the tower local control/ground control/controller-in-charge positions combined at the local control position, and two controllers were on break.  Runway 18/36 was closed and had been closed for 4 weeks.  Notices to airmen (NOTAM) 07/003 and 07/014 were in effect.  RDG NOTAM 07/003 advised that personnel and equipment were working at the approach end of runway 18; RDG NOTAM 07/014 advised that runway 18/36 was closed from 0700 to 1700 EDT Monday through Friday.

The airplane was pre-flighted, then towed out of the heated hangar and fueled.  The private pilot taxied to the end of the 5,400 foot long runway, parked, and performed an engine run-up.  After the run-up, the co-pilot reached the Elkins, West Virginia, AFSS on his cell phone, received a weather briefing, filed an IFR flight plan, and requested an IFR clearance.  Since Elkins was not the primary AFSS for the area, the briefer placed him on hold to service his request.  The call got disconnected, so he called the FSS back.  Due to the long hold time, the co-pilot then called Indianapolis Center and received an IFR clearance.  Once the clearance was obtained, the private pilot performed another engine run-up and noticed that about 3 to 4 inches of slush had accumulated on the runway, and about 1/2 to 3/4 inches of slush had accumulated along the surface of both wings.  The pilots discussed if they should return to the hangar and wipe off the wings, but agreed that the slush would \"blow-off\" during the take-off roll.   The private pilot estimated that he used about 4,500 feet of the runway before he obtained 80 knots (Vr).  He rotated the airplane, but it did not lift normally.  To avoid obstructions, the private pilot simultaneously turned the aircraft to the right, and retarded the throttle.  The airplane touched down, slid, turned, and came to rest upright facing the runway.  Examination of the airplane revealed that both wings were covered with snow, and localized areas of ice were found along the top surfaces of both wings near the trailing edge.  The air intake and pitot tube were absent of debris.  According to the airplane's pre-flight checklist, the wings and empennage surfaces should be clear of ice, snow, and frost prior to take-off.

Witnesses located at the arrival airport reported the accident airplane flew a fairly \"tight\" right downwind pattern for runway 36 that was a \"little low\" (about 650 to 750 feet above ground level [agl]).  The surface winds were from the east, and according to the witnesses, the result was that the pilot overshot his turn to final approach.  The pilot corrected back toward the centerline in a fairly steep bank when the airplane was observed to enter a roll to the right, the nose dropped toward the ground.  The witnesses then lost sight of the airplane as it descended behind trees in a nose low pitch attitude.  Witnesses estimated the altitude of the airplane at the time of the roll was between 300 and 350 feet agl.  The private pilot flew the airplane once within the preceding 6 months and twice within the past 12 months.  No anomalies with the airframe or engines were noted that would have prevented their normal operation.  According to the fixed-based operator, where the airplane was based, fueling personnel added 10 gallons to each wing prior to the accident flight; however, they were not sure what the airplane's total fuel quantity was.  The unusable fuel quantity was 6.1 gallons.  The fuel consumption rate varied between 24.4 and 33.0 gallons per hour depending on the power setting, and the accident flight lasted 35 minutes.  No fuel was found in the fuel system components for the right engine with the exception of the fuel manifold.  It was possible that the right engine's fuel supply line may have become unported during the steep bank to final; however, with an unknown fuel quantity, this could not be determined conclusively.  Toxicology tests performed on the pilot were positive for tramadol (prescription painkiller) and chlorpheniramine (antihistamine, commonly used in over-the-counter cold/allergy preparations).

The pilot aborted the landing and circled west of the airport.  He made several attempts to lower the gear, but each attempt was unsuccessful.  The pilot then flew by the control tower and was advised that the gear were up.  He then contacted his company's dispatch personnel, and a decision was made to fly to another airport where company maintenance personnel were based.  Prior to landing, the pilot once again flew by the tower, and was informed that the nose gear appeared to be down, but both main landing gear were dangling.  The pilot then completed the emergency landing checklist, secured the engine, and landed.  During the landing, the airplane veered off the right side of the runway.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the left side, landing gear down hydraulic line installed from the gear handle to the gear power pack was ruptured due to repeated contact with the aileron cable by control wheel movement.  The loss of hydraulic fluid would have also rendered the emergency landing gear hand pump useless.",

The pilot was advised by air traffic control that the landing gear appeared retracted but the landing gear doors were open.  The flight proceeded to another airport where the airplane was landed with the landing gear retracted.  Postaccident examination of the airplane by the FAA revealed a loose B-nut of a flexible hydraulic hose at the nose landing gear actuator; the hydraulic reservoir of the power pack was empty.  The hose was tightened, the reservoir was serviced, and the landing gear was cycled 3 times using the emergency hand pump.  Misadjustment of the down lock switches for each main landing gear was noted though all gears were down and locked over center during gear extension.  The pilot advised the FAA that before the accident, no work was performed to the landing gear, though records indicate the pilot purchased the flexible hydraulic hose that was found to have a loose B-nut.

Postcrash examination of the helicopter revealed a section of the tail rotor pitch change control rod and bellcrank clevis were fractured and missing. Metallurgical examination of the remaining bellcrank and rod showed fractures consistent with a bending overload fracture. Examination of the remainder of the helicopter control systems, structure, and engine showed no evidence of precrash failure or malfunction.",

The test flight was conducted to test an experimental parachute with a 331-pound anthropomorphic dummy that was rigged to the parachute.  Two crewmembers in the airplane's cabin were to push the dummy out of the door and the parachute would deploy by pulling on a static line that was secured to a floor seat track.  The static line for this flight had been reduced in length from 14 feet to 9 feet because of a previous test flight where a pin on the end of the static line became entangled with the elevator hinge and caused control problems.  With the shortened static line, it was in tension when the dummy was positioned in the doorway.  During the accident flight, once the dummy cleared the doorway, the static line deployed the pilot chute which in turn deployed the drogue chute.  The drogue chute cleared the top of the left horizontal stabilizer while the dummy fell below.  The dummy began oscillating and impacted the empennage and lower side of the horizontal stabilizer, eventually resulting in the partial separation and bending down of the stabilizer about midspan.  As the dummy became entangled on the left horizontal stabilizer, the airplane made an uncommanded nose over into a negative G arc, which threw one crewmember about the cabin while the second crewmember was able to restrain himself by holding onto the static line.   As the main parachute deployed, the drogue chute lines separated and the dummy and canopies fell away from the airplane.  As the dummy fell away, the airplane pitched up and began an uncommanded roll to the right, stopping in a fully inverted attitude.  The airplane initially nosed forward and then began a slow roll to the left, eventually stabilizing in wings level attitude.  The pilots then returned the airplane to the airport and landed without further incident.  Review of the parachute test program's Test Hazard Analysis revealed that the plan's cause/effect assessment and hazard mitigation actions inadequately addressed all potential \"out of aircraft\" hazard possibilities, including the effect of the parachute lines and/or dummy becoming entangled on the horizontal stabilizer.  Additionally, no revision to the Test Hazard Analysis was noted after the previous static line entanglement incident and subsequent shortening of the static line. ",
            "probable_cause": "the inadvertent early deployment of the test parachute lines and dummy and it's entanglement with the horizontal stabilizer, which resulted from the operator's inadequate test plan substantiation process for shortening the parachute's static line.."

The instrument-rated pilot may have felt pressured as the flight departed late. The accident airplane approached the destination airport from the east, descending at 250 knots ground speed from 8,800 feet above mean sea level (msl), on a 270 degree assigned heading, and was instructed to enter the right downwind for runway 10. The airplane's altitude readout was then observed by the approach controller to change to \"XXX.\" The pilot was queried regarding his altitude and he advised that he was descending to 3,200 feet msl. The pilot was asked to confirm that he was in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions and was advised that the minimum vectoring altitude (MVA) for the area was 5,500 feet msl. The pilot responded that \u201cWe just ahh,\u201d at which time the controller advised that she missed his transmission and asked him to repeat it. The pilot stated \u201cAhh roger, could we stay right just a little, we are in and out of some clouds right now.\u201d The controller advised the pilot to \u201cMaintain VFR\u201d and again of the MVA. The controller then made multiple attempts to contact the pilot without result. The wreckage was discovered on the side of a mountain, where the airplane impacted after entering instrument meteorological conditions. Because aircraft operating in VFR flight are not required to comply with minimum instrument altitudes, aircraft receiving VFR radar services are not automatically afforded Minimum Safe Altitude Warning services except by pilot request. The controller's query to the pilot about his altitude and flight conditions was based on her observation of the loss of altitude reporting information.  The pilot had not indicated any difficulty in maintaining VFR flight or terrain clearance up to that point.  His comment that the aircraft was \"in and out of some clouds\" was her first indication that the pilot was not operating in visual conditions, and came within seconds of impact with the terrain.  The controller was engaged in trying to correct the situation, and despite having been advised of the minimum vectoring altitude, the pilot continued to descend. The airplane was equipped with a terrain avoidance warning system but it could not be determined if it was functional. The pilot owned the charter operation.
