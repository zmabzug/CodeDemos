The flight crew programmed the flight management system for the approach and set up the onboard navigation systems accordingly; including the use of distance measuring equipment from another approach navigation aid to provide additional situation awareness. During descent, the flight crew discussed the navigation information displayed, compared it to the lights they could see on the horizon, and confirmed what they believed to be the airport beacon based on that comparison early in the descent.The approach controller cleared the flight direct to the final approach fix depicted on the RNAV approach to the runway of intended landing. While still about 20 miles from the destination airport, the approach controller advised the crew the airport was located at their 11 o'clock position and 15 miles although at the time, that position more closely approximated Downtown Airport. Branson Airport was slightly left at their 10 o'clock position and almost 20 miles. The flight crew called the airport in sight and accepted a visual approach clearance and handoff to Branson control tower. Upon checking in with Branson Tower, the crew was cleared to land on runway 14 at Branson.When the crew identified what they believed to be Branson Airport early in the descent, they did not crosscheck or verify the airport position using onboard navigation after that point. Perceiving they were a little high on the approach into Downtown Airport, they widened the base leg for descent and then descended below approach control radar coverage as they turn onto final approach. Therefore, from the perspective of the approach controller this appeared to be a normal flight path into Branson Airport up to the point when radar contact was lost.Instead, the flight crew lined up on final approach to runway 12 at Downtown Airport and proceeded to land. The captain recognized the error soon after touchdown when he realized the runway was shorter than expected and he applied maximum braking, coming to a stop about 300 feet from the end of the paved surface.",

A review of radar data showed the flight overflew W03 then diverted to Rocky Mount-Wilson Regional Airport (RWI), Rocky Mount, North Carolina. An airport employee at RWI stated that, while towing a King Air out of a hangar, he heard a pilot announce over the radio that he was making an approach to runway 4. He stated that the weather at the time was light rain, fog, and mist, and that winds were light and favoring runway 4. He said that he could not see the airplane on approach until it broke through the clouds, approximately 600 to 700 feet above ground level (AGL) estimated, and it was well left of the runway centerline. He could see that it was a Cessna 182. The airplane then climbed back into the clouds and departed the area to the northwest. The next radio communication the employee heard was a King Air pilot asking it anyone was talking to the Cessna 182, as Washington Center had lost contact. Recorded audio communication between the pilot and Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) found that the pilot reported to ARTCC that he was doing a missed approach at RWI. The controller told the pilot to climb and maintain 3,000 feet. The pilot then requested an alternate destination and the controller listed several airports including Greenville, North Carolina.

About 1 hour into the flight the pilot noticed a slight rpm drop, he applied throttle to compensate for the rpm decrease.  The pilot started the pre-descent procedures; he turned the auxiliary fuel pump on, applied carburetor heat, then reduced power, at this time the engine quit completely.  The pilot repositioned the fuel selector, switched the auxiliary fuel pump off and on, turned carburetor heat on and off, all actions were unsuccessful in restoring engine power.  The pilot established best glide airspeed, lowered full flaps, and while descending, the airplane contacted a raised sewer access.  The airplane then impacted the ground and came to rest inverted.  A witness reported observing black smoke trailing the airplane and heard the engine running rough.  Examination of the airplane following recovery by an FAA inspector revealed the fuel tank vent lines were clear of obstructions.  There was fuel found in the left wing and the right fuel tank was leaking fuel, the fuel boost pump operated electrically post accident.  Fuel samples from the right wing and gascolator showed no fuel contamination.  All spark plugs and inside ends of both exhaust pipes were found sooted.  The carburetor heat system which consists of a 5 inches long by 2 inches in diameter pipe secured to the exhaust crossover pipe, a \"Carb Heat Connector\" which is secured to the filtered air box forward of the air filter, and a scat hose that connects the two.  Additionally, a control in the cockpit activates an alternate air door located on the filtered air box forward of the carb heat muff inlet  The carburetor heat was able to function post accident and the engine was run to idle power setting; damage precluded operation at a higher rpm setting.  Bench testing of the carburetor by the manufacturer with FAA oversight revealed the carburetor was not within service limits, at comparable to idle power settings the fuel flow in terms of pounds-per-hour (pph) was 0.6 pph below service limits.  At the remaining four test points the fuel flow in pph was greater than the established rich limits.  At the last test point which equated to full throttle, the fuel flow was 18.5 pph above the established rich service limit.  The pilot reported verbally that approximately 50 flight hours earlier, when he was taxiing to takeoff, the engine quit just like it did during the accident flight.  The carburetor and engine driven fuel pump were replaced.  The engine quit again in a similar fashion, and the auxiliary fuel pump and all fuel lines were replaced.  Additionally, the fuel selector valve was disassembled and rebuilt.  The overhauled carburetor had been operated 54.5 hours since installation at the time of the accident.  The temperature and dew point at Peachtree city, two hours past the time of the accident, indicates serious carburetor icing at any power setting.  Flight testing of a RV6A airplane equipped with the same carburetor heat system, same model engine, and same model carburetor as the accident airplane but with a temperature probe revealed that with the engine operating at 75 percent power and carburetor heat applied, the temperature rise was 1/2 degree Fahrenheit above the temperature with carburetor heat off.  According to the general manager of Van's Aircraft, they offer 2 different types of carburetor heat systems, and they have not done any heat rise testing on any of the various carburetor heat systems that can be installed on RV type airplanes.  With respect to carburetor heat muffs, a section of the builders manual states that each builder is responsible for evaluating his/her own installation based on the liklihood of carburetor ice in his/her intended operating environment.",

The pilot lifted the helicopter into a hover 2 feet above ground level (agl) and departed into the wind, which was variable from 210-260 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 18 knots. After the helicopter entered translational lift, the pilot accelerated the helicopter to 30-35 knots and climbed to about 10-20 feet agl. The helicopter suddenly started to settle, the low rotor rpm warning light illuminated, and the warning horn sounded. The left seat passenger, who was a flight instructor, took control of the helicopter and attempted to recover rotor rpm. Unable to regain enough rotor rpm to maintain flight, he decided to land under control rather than continue to an uncontrolled crash. He was only able to slow the helicopter to about 15-20 knots before leveling the helicopter to land. The helicopter touched down in rough, uneven terrain, and substantial damage was incurred to the fuselage and tailboom. Examination of the helicopter did not show any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have resulted in the loss of main rotor rpm and settling. The pilot and the left seat passenger stated that they could have operated the helicopter at a lighter takeoff weight for greater performance or waited until early morning to depart when the cooler temperatures would have reduced the density altitude. Further, they stated that the wind gusts resulted in the loss of some of the headwind component. Additionally, the left seat passenger reported that at the time the helicopter began to settle, a freight train was crossing about 30 to 50 yards in front of the takeoff flight path of the helicopter. He stated that he believed the train probably blocked some of the headwind component as it passed. A reduction in the headwind component would have resulted in the helicopter settling at a critical point during the takeoff. The pilot and the left seat passenger stated that the collective was probably raised slightly to compensate for the settling, which caused the decay of main rotor rpm, and once that happened, the helicopter was in a position that was not recoverable.Given that the settling was sudden during an otherwise routine takeoff, it is likely that a wind gust, the blocking of the wind by the passing train, or a combination of the two resulted in an abrupt decrease in headwind, which caused the helicopter to lose lift and descend. Because the helicopter was already operating near its maximum performance capability (high gross weight at high density altitude), there was not enough reserve power available to stop the descent and maintain rotor rpm.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The student pilot was enrolled in a European flight training academy, which, in conjunction with a US-based operator, provided training services in accordance with European Joint Aviation Authorities standards. The US operator provided aircraft, training facilities, and flight instructors as part of a service agreement with the European academy. The purpose of the flight was to conduct a phase check on the student pilot. The syllabus included a cross-country flight with a subsequent in-flight diversion to a location unknown to the student pilot. The student pilot was located in the forward left seat, a flight instructor was in the forward right seat, and an evaluator was in an aft seat. The evaluator had considerable aviation experience in Europe; however, he only held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) private pilot license. Therefore, the flight instructor was used on the flight as a \"safety pilot,\" acting as pilot-in-command, to meet FAA regulatory requirements. The flight instructor had recently joined the US operator, but he was not incorporated into the European flight academy's flight training program; therefore, he had no prior experience as a safety pilot with the academy.The day before the accident, the evaluator provided the student pilot with instructions for the cross-country portion of the phase check, which included flight to a destination airport located in mountainous terrain with a directive to fly at an altitude of 1,000 feet above ground level (agl) throughout the flight. The student pilot was also asked to plan an en route 40-minute target arrival waypoint and to be ready to prepare for an in-flight diversion. The majority of the route planned by the student passed through a series of FAA-designated special conservation areas. Although the FAA did not prohibit flight through such areas, it did discourage it. Further, although the academy and operator did not explicitly prohibit  flights to be performed along the chosen route, cross-country check flights were typically accomplished in areas south of the departure airport where terrain was lower.According to radar data, the student pilot successfully manipulated the airplane in precise coordination with his flight plan for about the first 35 minutes following departure. Shortly thereafter, the airplane approached and passed the 40-minute waypoint and then continued along the planned route while in a shallow climb. Examination of the student's flight plan revealed that, to maintain 1,000 feet agl clearance as the airplane approached the waypoint, he would have needed to fly the airplane level and then below rising canyon walls on either side of the route. Avoiding terrain just beyond the waypoint would have required a prompt climb or diversion because the rapidly rising terrain would have required the airplane to climb at a rate that exceeded its climb capabilities. Further, downdrafts and high-density altitude conditions were present in the canyon, which likely further degraded the airplane's available climb performance. Thus, the airplane entered a steep canyon (still along the planned route) that it could neither climb out of nor turn around in. Shortly after, with the airplane flying straight and level, it struck a cliff face at the end of the canyon, 1,000 feet below the canyon's rim.The majority of the airplane's structure was consumed by postimpact fire; postaccident examination revealed no anomalies with the engine or airframe that would have precluded normal operation. Radar data indicated that the airplane was climbing about 4 minutes before impact and that the accident location was at the same elevation as the last radar target. Therefore, the engine was likely producing power during the final stages of the flight. Although no indications of in-flight fire were observed, toxicological tests for the evaluator revealed that he had been exposed to the products of combustion (carbon monoxide and cyanide); however, this likely occurred during the postcrash fire.None of the occupants had ever flown with each other, and no records were recovered indicating that the flight instructor or student pilot had ever flown to the presumed diversion airport. The evaluator arrived late for the flight, so the original flight instructor, who had flight commitments later in the day, asked the accident flight instructor to join the flight at the last minute, which did not allow him sufficient time to participate in the preflight oral briefing and limited the time he had to evaluate the flight plan.From a regulatory standpoint, the flight instructor was the pilot-in-command and, thus, was responsible for the safety of the flight. However, given his relatively junior status within the organization and the young student pilot's lack of experience, it is likely that both pilots deferred responsibility for the flight to the evaluator and trusted that the route was appropriate. It is possible that the unsuitable route was discussed and understood by all of the occupants; however, the reason for not performing the diversion at an appropriate time could not be determined.The Dutch Safety Board (DSB) was a party to the investigation and appointed an accredited representative in accordance with the provisions of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. The DSB submitted comments regarding the factual report, brief, and probable cause, and they are included in the public docket for this accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor's and the evaluator's failure to divert at an appropriate time during cruise flight, which resulted in the airplane's inability to maintain a sufficient altitude to clear rising terrain. Contributing to the accident was the flight evaluator's decision to allow the student pilot to plan for and execute a hazardous flight at an inappropriate altitude considering the terrain in high-density altitude conditions."

Thereafter, the airplane descended until landing hard on the runway in a nose low pitch attitude.  The airplane bounced/porpoised and impacted again whereupon it nosed over, slid to a stop, and was consumed by fire.   Examination of the thermally destroyed composite airplane revealed no evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure, and the reason for the pilot's failure to maintain control was not ascertained.  No evidence of any preexisting physical disability was noted during the pilot's autopsy.  Evidence of diphenhydramine was found in the pilot's blood and urine.

The left and right nose wheel struts and castoring assemblies were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Materials Laboratory for a metallurgical examination.

At 0823, while climbing through 2,000 feet msl, after departure from Providenciales,  the pilot of N3101G made contact with air traffic controllers at the FAA Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center. At 0848:51, the controller informed the pilot of N3101G that the flight would have to land in either Nassau or Freeport, Bahamas to clear up a problem with his permission to fly to Patrick Air Force Base. The pilot of N3101G selected Freeport, and was cleared to Freeport. At 0918:39, the pilot of N3101G reported to the controller that he was 83 miles from \"Burgo\" intersection, level at 10,000 feet, and in heavy rain.

The pilot responded \"I can't talk to you I'm very very heavy rain (unintelligible) once I get out of the rain I will (unintelligible)\". The controller responded that the flight would have to clear customs at Freeport, and then it could proceed to Patrick Air Force Base. At 0921:47, the pilot of N3101G responded he had customs waiting for him at Patrick Air Force Base. No further transmissions were received from the pilot of N3101G.

On contacting the Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), the pilot was informed that Emporia weather was 10 miles visibility, and an overcast ceiling of 600 feet agl. At 1951 central daylight time (cdt), Kansas City ARTCC cleared the pilot for the VOR approach into the Emporia Municipal Airport.   At 2002 cdt, the pilot reported that he was on the missed approach.  The pilot requested another VOR approach.  Kansas City ARTCC cleared the pilot for the approach, and told him to report 'established' on the approach.  At 2014 cdt, the pilot reported that he was established inbound on the VOR approach.  Kansas City ARTCC instructed the pilot to 'go over to advisory [frequency] and report cancellation on this frequency.'  The pilot responded,' Okay, we'll go ahead and cancel IFR right now.'  The airplane impacted the terrain, near Emporia Airport, at 2017 cdt.  The pilot's logbook showed that he had 44.1 hours of actual instrument time.  A pilot, who had departed the Emporia  Airport at approximately 2000 cdt, described the weather as 'marginal, a ceiling of around 700 feet agl,' and the visibility as being 6 to 7 miles.

A witness then reported that the nose of the glider pitched up and down until entering into a descent to ground impact.

About 150 feet beyond the touchdown point, the airplane began veering to the right. The pilot was unable to correct the veer, and the airplane skidded off the right side of the runway into the adjacent grass and dirt. The airplane came to rest upright on its belly, adjacent to the side of the runway, and facing in about the opposite direction of landing. The two main landing gear assemblies were collapsed aft, essentially into their near-retracted positions. The nose gear remained partially attached to the airplane and was overextended forward to a near-horizontal orientation. Much of the physical evidence that was obtained was consistent with the collapse or retraction of both main landing gear just after landing. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right main landing gear downlock mechanism functioned normally, but a slight anomaly with the left main landing gear downlock mechanism was observed. Because neither the pilot nor the air traffic controller reported a gear collapse, and the physical evidence was inconsistent with a left gear only collapse, a failure of that downlock was excluded as the cause of the right veer. An NTSB metallurgical examination indicated that the fractured nose landing gear components all failed due to tensile overload.

The airplanes were being operated in an area of high density student training. The left seat pilot of the Piper had just rolled out of a right turn associated with the entry to a practice holding pattern to a non-controlled airport. The left-seat pilot of the Cessna had departed a non-controlled airport and was in an en route climb to the cruise altitude, at which he would return to his home airport.

The turbulence box overlaid the departure airport and planned en route climb to altitude; however, the top of descent (TOD) and destination airport were clear of the turbulence.   When the pilot printed the flight release, SIGMET Whiskey 8, had been replaced with SIGMET Whiskey 9.  The turbulence box had moved east of the departure airport, and the TOD and destination airport remained clear of the turbulence box.  The flight release also contained a single pilot report of severe turbulence from a Boeing 737 at FL 240, within the defined area of turbulence.  Prior to departure, but after the flight release was signed by the pilot, the flight release was updated again, this time  with SIGMET Whiskey 10.   The turbulence box moved further east to cover the TOD and destination airport.  Nearing his destination, the pilot was descended into the turbulence box defined by both SIGMET Whiskey 9 and Whiskey 10. These turbulences boxes ranged from Ottawa, Canada, to Florida, to Cleveland, Ohio.  The pilot had turned on the seat belt sign, asked the flight attendant to be seated, and had already made an announcement for the passengers to remain seated as they were within 30 minutes of the destination airport.  While descending through 17,800 feet, the flight encountered severe turbulence.  The airplane was not equipped with ACARS.  Flight crews were required to monitor dispatch frequency for updates, and encouraged to get weather updates en route.   Weather updates were accomplished by direct radio contact between the dispatcher and pilots, or by the pilots accessing FAA facilities while en route.

The owner-pilot was not injured. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight plan was filed for the flight. According to the pilot, he was enroute from McClellan-Palomar airport, Carlsbad, California (CRQ) to Reno/Stead airport (RTS), Reno, Nevada in order to provide training to pilots participating in the upcoming Reno Air Races. He was cruising at an altitude of 10,500 feet, and was not in communication with air traffic control. The airplane has a single 60 gallon capacity fuel tank, and was equipped with two separate means to determine fuel quantity; a capacitance-type quantity gauging system, and a totalizer system that subtracts fuel used from initial fuel quantity.Shortly before the event, the pilot noted that the totalizer indicated a remaining quantity of 38 gallons, and a fuel burn rate of 15 gallons per hour, which indicated that he had sufficient fuel for the remainder of the flight. Until the event, all systems and operations were normal. At some point during cruise, in rapid succession, the pilot noticed a fuel smell, and the engine lost power, although it continued to windmill. The totalizer indicated that 37 gallons remained, but the capacitance system indicated that the fuel tank was empty. The engine was a Lycoming TIO-580 series. The pilot initially turned towards Fresno, with the intent to land at an airport there, but then opted to land off airport on a road instead. He observed a road that was long and straight, and appeared to be free of powerlines and other obstructions, and set up for landing on that road. However, after the pilot had deployed the landing gear and was \"committed\" to that landing selection, he noticed that there was more traffic than he was comfortable with, and therefore opted to land on the verge of the road. Since the verge was unpaved, the landing gear separated from the airplane after touchdown. The right wing struck the vegetation and a wire fence that bounded the verge, and the airplane came to a stop off the right side of the road.Shortly after the accident, FAA personnel and the pilot decowled the airplane. They observed that a steel B-nut on the line between the fuel pump and the fuel flow sensor had come loose, which allowed all the fuel to be pumped overboard. The B-nut had torque stripe on it but no provisions to be safetied, and the B-nut had backed off. The pilot, who was also the builder, reported that he conducted the bulk of the maintenance on his airplane. He held an air transport pilot certificate, and was a current airline pilot and former military pilot. He had about 750 hours in the accident airplane make and model. The 1453 automated weather observation at Madera Municipal airport (MAE), Madera, California, located about 10 miles west-northwest of the accident site, included winds from 290 degrees at 7 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, temperature 38 degrees C, dew point 7 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.69 inches of mercury.",

The flight instructor made several unsuccessful attempts to extend the landing gear using the emergency gear extension procedures, but the light did not illuminate. The pilot reported the condition to the air traffic controller, and he maneuvered the airplane for a low approach, and the controller advised the pilot that the gear appeared to be down. During the landing roll all three landing gears remained extended, but as the airplane slowed, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane veered off the runway colliding with a runway light. A postaccident examination of the right main landing gear revealed that the truss assembly hook assembly did not travel over the truss pin. The landing gear was tested, and the right main landing gear did not lock on any attempt. In addition, the right main landing gear truss bracket and stud had excessive friction and prevented the side brace from fully rotating, subsequently preventing the truss hook from traveling over the lock pin. The right main landing gear truss bracket pin had little or no grease present; however, the left main landing gear truss bracket pin had grease indications around the pin and zerk fitting. A review of the airframe maintenance records indicated that about a month before the accident, the airplane had completed a 100-hour inspection and a side brace mount assembly was installed in the right main landing gear. The mechanic who performed the maintenance stated that he could not find any guidance in the maintenance manual on how to remove and install the new bushing; therefore, he replaced the bushing and verified that there was movement between the two parts, and then reinstalled the side brace assembly on the airplane. The mechanic did not follow the proper procedures as described in the manufacturer maintenance manual. The accident occurred about 38 hours after the 100-hour inspection.",

The inspection also revealed that \u201csmoking\u201d was visible around some of the rivet holes indicating that the rivets were loose. When the pilot purchased the unfinished airplane, the riveting had already been accomplished.   The kit manufacturer calls for Avex rivets to be used.

FBO personnel informed him that they had been made aware that a passer-by had seen something fall from an airplane, which was subsequently identified as a nose landing gear (NLG), and that the FBO believed that the NLG possibly belonged to N452PC. The pilot returned to PWT and conducted a flyby, to allow the FBO personnel to examine the airplane. They confirmed that N452PC had lost its NLG. The FBO then coordinated with the pilot to postpone landing until the airport could be closed to other traffic, and fire/rescue personnel could be present. After waiting about 30 minutes, the pilot was given permission to land. He landed with full flaps, as slowly as he could. The airplane landed normally, settled on the NLG strut, and stopped on the runway.According to the pilot, he completed constructing and first flew the airplane in 1998, and had put about 811 hours on it since then. The airplane was equipped with a Rotax 912UL series engine. The pilot held a private pilot certificate, and had a total flight experience of about 883 hours.About 2 days after the accident, the pilot was informed by another Pulsar operator that there were 5 previous events of NLG separations on Pulsar airplanes. Reportedly, a new NLG fitting had been designed by another owner to eliminate the underlying problem, which was traced to a corroded attach bolt that was difficult to access or inspect. Also reportedly, these failures only affected Pulsar \"Series 1\" airplanesThe 1055 PWT automated weather observation included winds from 030 degrees at 8 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, temperature 21 degrees C, dew point 6 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.38 inches of mercury.",

Airline procedures permit crews to conduct such approaches when weather is at category 1 (CAT I) minimums or better.  Weather at the time of the accident included good visual conditions, and was not a factor in the accident.   Additionally, wake turbulence was not a factor in the accident.  The airline's flight operations manual stated: \"Except for facilities that have a restrictive note, autoland approaches are permissible to all [instrument landing system (ILS)] facilities.  When a restrictive note regarding the localizer or glide slope appears on [an approach chart], autoland is not authorized.\"  The ILS runway 8 approach chart was notated \"unusable from 0.8 nm to threshold.\"  The crew reported, and the flight data recorder (FDR) confirmed, that the airplane began to drift off the centerline of the approach at about three-quarters of a mile from the runway threshold.  The drift was consistent with the direction of the wind and the ILS chart notation.  Additionally, both Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) advisory material, and the airline's flight operations manual direct pilots to advise air traffic control (ATC) when conducting an autoland approach, to allow ATC to ensure that appropriate areas are clear of vehicles or other obstructions which may affect the localizer signals.  The flight crew did not advise ATC of the autoland approach.  After the airplane drifted off the centerline, the first officer disconnected the autopilot and hand-flew the airplane back to the center of the runway, thereby prolonging the flare.  Airline training material noted that a prolonged flare is a risk factor for tailstrikes.  The airplane did not touch down until approximately 4,000 feet from the landing threshold.  Recovering from the drift off-centerline led to the first officer prolonging the flare, and landing long, at a lower speed than nominal.  FDR information indicated that during the landing flare, the horizontal stabilizer moved to a position that would command full nose up trim.  During the landing, the tail struck the ground, and the airplane received substantial damage.  An assessment of the Boeing 757 horizontal stabilizer trim control system indicated that the rate of trim change seen during the flare could only be achieved by operating the control yoke stabilizer trim switch, or by using the stabilizer trim control levers on the center pedestal.  Post-accident tests of the trim system revealed no anomalies.  During a post-accident training session, the first officer was noted to handle the yoke such that he inadvertently activated the trim switch to the nose-up position.  Airline training material noted that use of nose-up trim during the flare is a risk factor for tailstrikes.  Analysis of the evidence indicates it is likely that during the flare, the first officer inadvertently activated full nose up trim, resulting in abnormal control forces on the yoke and a higher than normal pitch attitude, leading to the tailstrike.",
            "probable_cause": "the first officer's inadvertent application of full nose-up trim during a prolonged flare, resulting in an excessive pitch angle during landing and subsequent tailstrike.  Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to correct the airplane's drift from the centerline approach course during short final approach, leading to the prolonged flare, and their improper decision to perform a practice autoland approach using a restricted procedure."

As the airplane passed under the dark cloud, at about 3,000 feet mean sea level, the flight immediately encountered a violent and rapid turbulence event. During the turbulence episode the airplane descended several hundred feet, but the pilot was able to maintain control. The pilot performed an uneventful landing and no damage was noted during the preflight inspection for the subsequent flight. Damage was noted during a later preflight inspection 4 days after the upset. An engineer from the airplane's manufacturer completed an evaluation of the damage incurred during the upset. He stated that the damage sustained by the left wing structure is indicative that the airplane experienced loads in excess of its design limits. A review of weather radar data indicated that a squall line was close to the airplane's location at the time of the upset. According to an analysis done by the Safety Board's meteorology specialist, the airplane most likely flew under either a \"roll cloud\" or a \"shelf cloud.\" Although no exact magnitudes of shear velocities associated with roll or shelf clouds encountered could be determined, severe or extreme turbulence should always be expected in vicinity of these cloud types. In addition, the radial velocity and spectrum width data showed signatures of potential severe or extreme turbulence in the area where the airplane likely encountered the phenomena.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's encounter with severe turbulence during descent into the airport environment, which resulted in an exceedence of the aircraft's design stress limit and structural damage."

The second pilot visually checked both fuel tanks and noted that the left tank was low.  He stated that he had mentioned this to the first pilot, and the first pilot did not 'carefully note.'  The first pilot selected the left tank for the flight because the left fuel quantity gauge was erroneously indicating a full tank.  During the third touch-and-go takeoff, the engine was starved of fuel and suddenly lost all power about 300 feet above the ground.  The second pilot, who was also a CFI, immediately took the controls, banked the airplane to the right to avoid trees, and force landed the airplane into an open corn field.  The right wing struck the ground during the landing and the airplane nosed over.  No preimpact mechanical deficiencies were found with the engine.

The pilot added power but the airplane contacted the runway in a nose down attitude.  The wind was reported to be from 290 degrees at 13 knots, gusting to 19 knots.

The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight. According to the pilot, the airplane was based at Polson airport (8S1), Polson, Montana, and he planned to travel to St Ignatius, Montana, with an intermediate touch and go at Ronan airport (7S0), Ronan. The pilot reported that he completed the landing at Ronan \"routinely\" with full carburetor heat and 10 degrees of flaps. He retracted the flaps, shut off the carburetor heat, took off, and began the climb out for St Ignatius. When the airplane was about 300-400 feet above ground level (agl), the engine began to \"slow down,\" despite the controls being set to full throttle, full rich mixture, and no carburetor heat. The engine continued to lose power, so the pilot turned left slightly to gauge whether the airplane could make it back to the runway. As the airplane entered the left turn, the climb performance decreased \"substantially,\" and the airplane began to lose altitude quickly. The pilot then decided to perform an emergency landing in a nearby plowed field. Due to the low altitude, the pilot did not have time to perform any emergency procedures, other than to inform his passenger that he was going to land in the field, and advise the passenger to tighten his seatbelt.

The flight instructor, who was also on the controls with the student pilot, reported that there was a three mile per hour crosswind from the right, so they both moved the bar to the left to correct for the wind and positioned the aircraft back to the right and over the runway centerline.  However, once the correction was made, the aircraft continued to drift to the right.

The pilot therefore tried once again to select the left tank, but was unable to place the selector in the correct position.

A witness observed the right engine hanging from its lower mounts as the airplane turned right and headed towards the nearest airport.  The airplane impacted trees approximately 1 mile short of the runway threshold. Examination of the right engine propeller revealed that one of its blades was separated about mid-span.  The separated tip section of the blade was not recovered.  Metallurgical examination of the fracture surface revealed that the blade failed as a result of a fatigue crack that originated from corrosion pits on the camber surface (face) of the blade. The failed blade was examined approximately 6 hours prior to the accident in accordance with an airworthiness directive (AD 81-13-06 R2) that called for inspections of the blade for corrosion and fatigue.  However, the inspections called out in the AD were only applicable to the blade fillet and shank regions, well inboard of the fracture location on the failed blade.  Overhaul of the propeller in accordance with the propeller manufacturer's manual includes grinding of each blade to 'remove all visual evidence of corrosion.'

A witness who resided approximately one mile northwest of the accident site reported that he was awakened from a \"deep sleep\" to the sound of an airplane engine.  He stated that he looked out the window and saw the aircraft's lights at what appeared to be \"tree top height\" about 1/4 to 1/2 mile to the east-southeast.  He went outside but at that point the aircraft was out of site.  He heard no sound at all at that time.  He recalled that it was foggy.  As it got light that morning, he noted that there was a low cloud layer.  The accident site was located in an uninhabited wetlands conservation area on a 150-foot wide by 10-foot high hill, situated between a small river and a marsh area.  Initial impact was on the north side of the hill.  The main wreckage came to rest on the opposite side of the hill, about 120 feet from the initial impact.  A detailed post-accident examination of the aircraft was conducted.  No evidence consistent with a pre-impact failure or malfunction was observed.  Weather reporting in the vicinity of the accident site was limited.  The departure airport recorded visibilities of one statute mile (sm) at the approximate time of departure.  Airports in the vicinity of Kansas City, about 50 miles north and northwest of the accident site, recorded instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), with visibilities of 1/4 sm in fog and vertical visibilities of 100 feet.  Airports south of the route of flight reported visual meteorological conditions (VMC).  Satellite imagery depicted an area of low stratus and fog over the region, with cloud tops of approximately 5,000 feet msl.  The non-instrument rated pilot contacted a Flight Service Station and obtained a pre-flight weather briefing.  The briefer advised the pilot that an advisory for instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions was in effect for his route of flight and that visual flight rules (VFR) flight was not recommended.  The briefer provided weather conditions at Emporia, 47 miles northwest of the departure airport, as overcast clouds at 200 feet agl and 3/4 sm visibility in mist.  Conditions at Chanute, 13 miles south of the departure airport, were clear below 12,000 feet agl and 6 miles visibility in mist.  The briefer commented on the limited weather reporting in the area, stating:  \"The problem in that area where you are there is very limited weather reporting . . . except for Emporia and Chanute and . . . they're just drastically different.\"  The pilot replied:  \"Well we're pretty close to Chanute so I think I'll be OK.\"  The area forecast in effect at the time of the accident was for broken ceilings at 1,000 feet agl and cloud tops at 5,000 feet mean sea level (msl) over the eastern one-third of Kansas.  The southwest quarter of Missouri was forecast to have overcast ceilings at 5,000 feet agl.  The northwest quarter of Missouri was forecast for overcast ceilings at 1,000 feet agl and cloud tops to 4,000 feet msl.  Civil twilight began at 0641 and sunrise was at 0708.  Radar track data depicted the accident aircraft  proceeding from a point about 1-1/2 miles east of the departure airport, on an east-northeast course at a maximum altitude of 5,200 feet msl.  Final radar contact was at 4,900 feet msl, about 1/2 mile northwest of the accident site.  In the 1-1/2 minutes immediately prior to the final radar data point, the aircraft entered a marked right turn.  The radar track depicted was consistent with a gradually decreasing turn radius.

An inspection of the airplane revealed that the elevator (pitch) trim control was reversed.  The 2007 model airplane had a provision for the installation of an aftermarket electric trim option.  This meant that the airplane was delivered to the customer without an operating electric trim system in order that the airplane could be retrofitted at a later date.  Prior to its departure from the previous airport, the airplane's manual electric trim was enabled in accordance with the appropriate manufactures service bulletin. A subsequent inspection by the airplane manufacturer revealed that the wires connecting the yoke's trim control switch were incorrectly labeled.

The pilot checked weather prior to departure, and said that at 0610, the weather was mostly cloudy with surface winds from the south at 3 to 5 mph.  About 0635, the nearby Deer Valley airport ATCT told the pilot that surface winds were 12 knots from 220 degrees.  In addition, another company pilot told him by radio that surface winds in his location were now 25 mph.  The pilot's ground crew also confirmed that surface winds had increased substantially.  The pilot said that he was 3,000 feet msl when the change in wind velocity was reported, and he selected an alternate landing site and briefed his passengers on high wind landing procedures.  The approach was initiated at a descent rate of 700 fpm.  During this time he told the two standing passengers to sit down because they would be experiencing a very rough landing.  After descending through 500 feet agl at 700 fpm, the balloon's vertical sink rate suddenly increased substantially.  He said this encounter had caused distortion in the envelope that resulted in the envelope losing hot air (lift), and increasing his rate of descent.  His attempt to slow the descent in the time remaining was unsuccessful and the balloon landed short of the intended site, rebounded into the air, and then skidded about 100 yards before coming to a stop with the carriage lying on its side.  Another balloon pilot, who saw the landing, said that the balloon appeared to have encountered a sudden microburst that resulted in an inadvertent hard landing.  Other witnesses described the final descent as rapid, and noted that the envelope was distorted (flattened) downward as if the balloon was being pushed down.  According to the FAA approved performance data sheet, terminal velocity (Vt) of the balloon under maximum gross weight conditions is 1,200 fpm with a recovery time to equilibrium 90 seconds, and altitude lost during recovery (from application of burner to equilibrium) to be 1,000 feet.  The POH states that should weather conditions deteriorate while in flight, the pilot should land immediately, and \"to risk damage if necessary to land while the flight is still under control.\"  The manufacturer reported that the maximum demonstrated wind speed at landing during certification testing was 7 knots. ",
            "probable_cause": "An unforecast encounter with a low level microburst that resulted in a distortion of the balloon envelope, an excessive outflow of hot air (loss of lift), creating an excessive rate of descent that was beyond the performance capability of the balloon to recover in the altitude available.
