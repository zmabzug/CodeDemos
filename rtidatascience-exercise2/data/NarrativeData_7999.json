The private pilot received minor injuries. The passenger was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, which departed Eugenio Maria de Hostos Airport (TJMZ) Mayaguez, Puerto Rico.According to the pilot, he arrived at TJMZ on the day of the accident at approximately 1600 to purchase the airplane. He and the owner made a short test flight of approximately 15 to 20 minutes, and then returned to the airport. He then paid the owner of the airplane the purchase price for the airplane. He then received a telephone call from his brother-in-law and invited him to come out to the airport for a short flight to show him the airplane he just purchased. The pilot then left the airport at approximately 1802, purchased premium gasoline for the airplane at a local gas station, and then refueled the airplane. After the refueling process was complete, at approximately 1815 he and his passenger boarded the airplane and taxied out for takeoff. The pilot then verified that the gasoline valve was on, and conducted a magneto check. After takeoff, they climbed to about 1,000 feet above sea level.About 20 minutes into the flight, the pilot noticed that the engine was not producing enough power to sustain flight. It never quit completely, but it would not produce full power, so he started checking the airplane systems to make sure they were functional and began to troubleshoot while he flew a course that would place the airplane parallel to the shoreline over shallow water near Rincon, Puerto Rico. He observed that there were people and sharp rocks along the shoreline, so he decided not to land on the beach, and instead decided to ditch the airplane in the water. He then maneuvered the airplane until it was 4 to 6 feet above the water and set the wing flaps to 20 degrees. He then stalled the airplane, and touched down on the surface of the water. Upon touch down the airplane decelerated and became submerged but, did not nose over. The pilot then released his seatbelt, and about 5 seconds later, he was able to egress and swim to the surface. When the pilot reached the surface, he did not see his passenger. As a result, he swam back down to the wreckage and after locating him, released his seatbelt and swam him up to the surface but his passenger was not breathing. By this time, a person on a boogie board had reached him. They placed the passenger on the boogie board and the passenger was paddled to the beach where cardio pulmonary resuscitation was performed but was unsuccessful.On February 21, 2015, the wreckage of the airplane was recovered from approximately 40 feet of water about 200 feet off the beach near Rincon, Puerto Rico and transported to the Port of Mayaguez.The wreckage was retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

As a secondary securing method, four countersunk screws are in line chordwise and offset in pairs on each side of the blade.  All four screw holes showed no significant evidence of deformation.  It was determined that the four countersunk screws were ineffective due to the limited amount of clamping provided by the machining, at the manufacturer, of too large a diameter in the countersunk hole relative to the diameter of the screw head, thus allowing the four secondary load path screws to slip behind the spar, resulting in the tip block separating from the blade.

Immediately after takeoff, while the airplane was climbing through approximately 300 feet above the ground, the pilot reported experiencing a total loss of engine power.  Due to the low altitude, the pilot was only able to make one attempt to restart the engine.  The pilot reported that he was unable to start the engine.  The airplane sustained structural damage during the forced landing.  Fuel was present in the airplane's fuel tanks.  After the airplane was recovered, the engine was inspected.  The engine examination revealed the engine itself did not sustain any damage.  A thumb compression test was conducted on each cylinder, fuel was present in both carburetor bowls, and the electric fuel pump operated and displaced fuel.  The engine's electric starter was used to rotate the engine, and ignition spark was observed on each top cylinder sparkplug.  No anomalies were found that could have prevented normal engine operation.  The reason for the reported loss of engine power could not be determined.

Dark night visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at LSE. A ramp services employee at LSE who had observed the helicopter lift off and proceed east-southeast observed \u201cmoderate\u201d rain and \u201cfair\u201d visibility at the time of takeoff. Witnesses located southeast of the airport reported hearing the helicopter in flight about the time of the accident, and one witness reported hearing a loud crashing sound. A search was initiated shortly after the crash but was hampered by the terrain and fog that had formed overnight. A search located the helicopter the following morning; the helicopter had impacted trees along a sparsely populated ridgeline about 5 miles southeast of LSE. The elevation of the ridgeline was approximately 1,164 feet msl, with 50- to 60-foot-tall trees in the area initially struck by the helicopter.  Distribution of the wreckage was consistent with the helicopter impacting the trees in a nearly level flight attitude under controlled flight. Examination of the helicopter\u2019s engines revealed inlet debris, rotational scoring, and centrifugal turbine blade overload failures consistent with the engines being operated at a moderate to high power level (on both engines) at the time of impact. Nonvolatile memory downloaded from the digital engine control units (DECUs) indicated that both engines were in \u201cflight mode\u201d at the time of impact. Although the left engine main selector switch was observed in the \u201cidle\u201d position after the accident, the lack of anomalies related to the switch and the corresponding DECU in flight mode are consistent with the switch having been moved as a result of impact. No preimpact mechanical malfunctions of the helicopter were found.The reported weather conditions at LSE about 2253 included VMC: calm winds, 8 miles visibility in light rain, few clouds at 1,400 feet above ground level (agl) [2,056 feet msl], overcast clouds at 5,000 feet agl (5,656 feet msl), temperature 10 degrees C, dew point 8 degrees C, and altimeter 29.70 inches of mercury. The preflight weather briefing obtained by the pilot about 1 hour before departure indicated VMC along the route of flight at the time of the briefing but forecasted deteriorating conditions later in the evening after about 2200, including possible instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Search and rescue personnel reported fog and mist along the ridgeline overnight during the search operations. Additionally, an EMS pilot for another operator reported that when he departed LSE about 2 hours before the accident flight, fog was beginning to form on the west side of the Mississippi River and in the bluffs east of his flight route. He subsequently returned to LSE and declined at least one additional flight that evening due to deteriorating weather conditions. Because of the variability in weather conditions on the night of the accident, the investigation could not determine if the pilot encountered IMC at the time of the accident. The pilot was transferred to the accident operator as a result of the accident operator\u2019s acquisition of his previous employer about 3 months before the accident. The accident pilot was initially qualified as visual flight rules (VFR)-only. An instrument proficiency check was not completed in conjunction with initial training. As a result, the accident pilot was limited to VFR-only operations at the time of the accident. (The accident pilot was current for instrument flight rules [IFR] at his previous place of employment.) During preflight planning, the pilot should have identified any obstacles along the route of flight, including the tree-covered ridgeline. Company records indicated that the pilot had completed one prior flight to LSE within the previous 16-month period, which was about 2 months before the accident. To assist pilots, maximum elevation figures (MEF) are noted on sectional charts and are derived from such features as terrain, trees, and towers. An MEF is specified for each latitude/longitude quadrangle on the chart. Operation at or above the applicable MEF will ensure terrain and obstacle clearance. The MEF for the La Crosse area is 2,200 feet msl. In addition to the MEF, sectional charts depict terrain elevation and specific obstacle height information. If the accident pilot had observed the MEF of 2,200 feet msl, or the terrain elevation/obstacle height information, it would have provided clearance of the tree covered ridgeline. The elevation of the ridge in the vicinity of the tree strikes was approximately 1,164 feet msl. With the 50- to 60-foot-tall trees, the elevation of the treetops was about 1,224 feet msl, providing a margin of approximately 831 feet to the level of the reported \u201cfew clouds\u201d and 4,431 feet to the overcast layer of clouds. According to Air Methods Corporation, the accident pilot performed a formal flight risk assessment before the flight. Further, the flight was being tracked by a company flight-following program and received flight dispatch services before the start of the flight. According to the Air Methods General Operating Manual, the pilot\u2019s risk assessment was to be recorded in the pilot\u2019s daily flight log. However, the pilot\u2019s daily flight log was destroyed during the crash. The pilot entered a risk assessment of \u201cA\u201d (normal operations) into the flight dispatch computer system before the flight. While the weather in the LSE area was marginal at the time of the accident, it was above the minimums required by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations and the operator\u2019s procedures. There were no identified weather risks that would have warranted classifying the flight in the risk assessment category \u201cB\u201d (caution). A radar altimeter was installed on the helicopter and, according to Air Methods, was normally set to 500 feet for night flight. On December 21, 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued Safety Recommendations A-07-111 and -112, asking the FAA, respectively, to require helicopter EMS (HEMS) operators to install radar altimeters in all helicopters used in HEMS night operations and ensure that the minimum equipment lists for helicopters used in HEMS operations require that radar altimeters be operable during flights conducted at night. On March 10, 2008, the FAA stated that it agreed with the intent of these recommendations and was considering rulemaking to require all 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 HEMS operators conducting night HEMS operations to have an operable radar altimeter installed in the helicopter. On August 17, 2009, the FAA indicated that it revised FAA Order 8900.1, \u201cFlight Standards Information Management System,\u201d to provide standards and procedures for inspectors to evaluate flat light or whiteout training programs for all helicopter operators. The FAA also stated that an in-progress notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for air ambulance and commercial helicopter operations would address the safety intent of these recommendations. On March 12, 2010, the NTSB stated that, although it agrees that increased training for pilots may be of benefit in avoiding accidents where radar altimeters are needed, issuing guidance and standards for such training is not responsive to these recommendations. The NTSB further indicated that it is pleased to learn that the planned NPRM will include language proposing the recommended requirements for radar altimeters. Pending the issuance of a final rule requiring (1) the installation of radar altimeters in all helicopters used in HEMS night operations and (2) the inclusion of a requirement on the minimum equipment lists that these altimeters be operable on all helicopters during HEMS flights conducted at night, Safety Recommendations A-07-111 and 112 were classified \u201cOpen\u2014Acceptable Response.\u201d In this accident, the radar altimeter should have alerted the pilot when terrain clearance dropped below 500 feet agl. Although Air Methods\u2019 company policy was to set the radar altimeter to 500 feet for night flight, the NTSB was unable to verify that the radar altimeter was, in fact, turned on and set to 500 feet for the accident flight. Assuming that the radar altimeter was turned on, set to 500 feet, and functioning properly at the time of the accident, the pilot likely would have received numerous alerts between 4 nautical miles (nm) and 2 nm from the point of impact and constant alerts from 2 nm to the point of impact. The NTSB was unable to determine why the pilot did not take corrective action in response to the alerts from the radar altimeter or, if the pilot did take corrective action, why it was ineffective. There was no record of any maintenance issues regarding the accident helicopter\u2019s radar altimeter.  The helicopter was not equipped with a terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). TAWS detects terrain or other obstructions along the flightpath and provides an audible alert to warn the pilot to take corrective action. TAWS looks forward to detect terrain and obstacles in front of the aircraft, while the radar altimeter looks down to measure the distance between the aircraft and the terrain below the aircraft. In addition, TAWS issues an audible alert, whereas the radar altimeter issues a visual alert. Typically, a HEMS pilot flying at night would benefit from an audible alert because the pilot would be looking forward out of the cockpit for a VFR flight; the radar altimeter is used mainly in the IFR environment. Further, because the clouds were low on the night of the accident, the pilot may have been deliberately flying below 500 feet to avoid the clouds. In that case, the pilot may have been purposely ignoring radar altimeter illuminations, but TAWS would have captured his attention because it looks forward and provides an audible alert.On February 7, 2006, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-06-15, which asked the FAA to require EMS operators to install TAWS on their aircraft and to provide adequate training to ensure that flight crews are capable of using the systems to safely conduct EMS operations. The FAA responded that, while it would work with industry to address issues related to the installation of TAWS on EMS aircraft, it would address the issue of controlled flight into terrain by emphasizing effective preflight planning.The FAA further stated that the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics established a committee tasked with developing helicopter TAWS (H-TAWS) standards and that, in March 2008, the commission completed the development of minimum operational performance standards for H-TAWS. On December 17, 2008, the FAA published Technical Standard Order C194, \u201cHelicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning System,\u201d based on the commission standards. On January 23, 2009, the NTSB indicated that the continuing delays in development of a final rule to require H-TAWS were not acceptable. On November 4, 2009, the FAA responded by indicating that it was developing an NPRM to address this recommendation and that it planned to complete work on the NPRM in January 2010. The NPRM has not yet been issued. On November 13, 2009, the NTSB reiterated Safety Recommendation A-06-15 in its report regarding the September 27, 2008, accident involving an Aerospatiale SA365N1, N92MD, operated by the Maryland State Police, which crashed during approach to landing near District Heights, Maryland. On February 18, 2010, the NTSB indicated that it remained concerned about the time required to develop and issue this requirement. The NTSB classified Safety Recommendation A-06-15 \u201cOpen\u2014Unacceptable Response,\u201d pending adoption of a requirement that all EMS operators equip their aircraft with and use TAWS. An installed and operable H-TAWS unit would likely have alerted the accident pilot to the rising terrain and provided an opportunity to climb, thereby allowing the pilot to avoid the ridgeline.Member Sumwalt did not approve this brief and probable cause.

The first officer performed a walk-around before the first flight leg which included checking the fuel tanks.  A total of 460 gallons of fuel were added to the fuel tanks, and a delay loading cargo occurred.  After both engines were started to begin the first flight, the engines remained operated for between 9-10 minutes before they were secured due to a radio problem.  Maintenance personnel reracked the VHF radios, and again the engines were started where the airplane remained on the ramp 3-4 minutes before taxiing to the runway.  The airplane remained at the runway hold short area for between 20 and 25 minutes before returning to the ramp due to a radio problem.  The engines were secured, and a new VHF radio was purchased and installed.  The company did not prepare new dispatch release, or weight and balance forms for the flight taking into account the additional fuel consumed with the engines operating.  The engines were started, and the airplane was taxied to the runway and departed for the planned first leg.  The airplane landed uneventfully at the destination airport where the cargo was offloaded.  The first officer performed a walk-around which included checking the fuel tanks; 300 gallons of fuel were added to the fuel tanks (150 gallons in each side).  The flight departed to return and when near the coastline, the flight was vectored to an airport other than the planned destination due to a issue with U.S. Customs.  The flight landed uneventfully, and experienced a delay clearing customs.  While on the ground before departure on the accident flight, the first officer reportedly performed a walk-around which included checking the fuel tanks with the captain looking on.  The first officer reported that each fuel tank had approximately 1,100 pounds of fuel, and he and the captain both agreed before takeoff as to the quantity of fuel on-board as indicated by the magna-sticks.  No fuel was purchased.  Following starting of both engines for the accident flight, the first officer checked the fuel quantity gauges indications against the magna-sticks indications he observed; the fuel quantity gauges indicated approximately 200 pounds more.  The flight departed, proceeded eastbound, and climbed to approximately 2,100 feet msl.  During a right turn from a southeast to westerly heading, the right engine experienced a loss of horsepower which decreased from 900 to zero.  The right engine was secured as a precaution,  and priority handling to the destination airport was requested with air traffic control.  The left engine horsepower remained the same (900) for a period of 31 seconds following the right engine horsepower decrease, then increased to 2,200, and remained at that value for 1 minute 13 seconds.  The left engine horsepower then began to decrease and dropped to zero.  The airplane was turned to the east, then turned to the south and ditched.  The captain and first officer evacuated but remained with the airplane, and made it to shore where the first officer advised his wife that something was wrong with the fuel gauges.  Following recovery of the airplane, pressure testing of the left fuel tank revealed no evidence of preimpact leakage.  Pressure testing of the right fuel tank revealed slight leakage past the fuel cap.  Boroscope examination of the engines, and functional test of each engine ignition system, fuel control units and fuel pumps revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the installed magna-sticks revealed no evidence of preimpact failure.  The left fuel tank was drained and found to contain 2 gallons of Jet A fuel, while the right fuel tank was drained and found to contain approximately 540 gallons of salt water and 1/2 gallon of Jet A fuel.  Fuel consumption calculations performed by FAA personnel revealed that at the time of engine start for the accident flight, the fuel tanks contained approximately 714 pounds of fuel.  According to a representative of the engine manufacturer, the amount of fuel drained from the engine components post accident was consistent with, \"low residual fuel.\"",
            "probable_cause": "The inadequate dispatch of the airplane by company personnel prior to the first leg of the flight due to failure of company personnel to prepare a new flight release and weight and balance after considerable time on the ground with the engines operating.  Also causal, was the inadequate preflight of the airplane by the captain by which he failed to note the low level of fuel in the fuel tanks before departure resulting in total loss of engine power of both engines due to fuel exhaustion and subsequent ditching of the airplane.  A finding in the accident was the inaccurate fuel quantity gauges."

The pilot stated he would deviate around the weather on a 300 degree heading.  Examination of recorded display data showed that when the pilot advised that he would be turning to a 300 degree heading to avoid weather, the controller's display was showing moderate (Level 2) and heavy (Level 3 to 4) and intense to extreme (Level 5 to 6) weather in that direction.  The controller did not advise the pilot of the depicted weather as required by FAA Order 7110.65, paragraph 2-6-4, \"Weather and Chaff Services.\"  Review of weather radar images confirmed that shortly thereafter, the airplane penetrated an intense Level 5 thunderstorm.  About 1 minute after the heading change, the pilot asked the controller if his heading was clear of weather, to which the controller responded that he could not suggest any headings.  About 2 minutes later, the pilot asked the controller if there was weather ahead of him, and the controller did not respond.  About 30 seconds later, the pilot again asked about weather in front of him and reported he was in \"difficult shape.\"  The controller responded that he showed the airplane encountering \"extreme precipitation\" and asked the pilot his intentions.  The pilot requested a heading and the controller responded with a suggestion that the pilot turn 20 degrees right.  The pilot acknowledged and shortly thereafter, the airplane entered a rapid descent.  Several witnesses stated that they saw the airplane emerge from the clouds at an altitude of about 300 feet, on its side, and descending.

The flight instructor added that the vibration stopped and he elected to continue the climb turning toward a downwind leg for the next autorotation.   The helicopter shuttered again, this time much more violently, while on the downwind leg.  The pilot stated on the NTSB Form 6120.1, Pilot/Operator Accident/Incident Report, that \"I felt like the gearbox was locking up or something.\"  The rated student pilot who was flying the helicopter at the time then declared \"you've got the controls\" to the instructor.  The flight instructor immediately entered autorotation and the shutter stopped.  In an attempt to regain powered flight the instructor then reapplied throttle which immediately created a violent vibration again and he decided to roll throttle completely off and continue with the emergency landing.  The altitude at the onset was approximately 400 feet above ground level (agl).  The flight instructor initiated a 180-degree turn autorotation to align the helicopter into the prevailing wind.  The flight instructor also stated that the transfer of controls and attempt to regain powered flight, followed by the delay in entering the autorational turn, created a low airspeed and low rotor RPM situation that made the successful landing not possible.  The flight instructor stated that he \"waited until the last second and pulled the collective up to the stops and prayed.\"  The helicopter landed hard and managed to remain in the upright position.  The flight instructor and the rated student pilot were not injured.  An FAA inspector, who traveled to the site, noted that the spark plug and helicoil was broken out on the number two cylinder.

He slowed the airplane and landed uneventfully at an alternate airport.  Damage to the empennage was noted.  Both elevators/rudders (ruddervators) were out of balance limits and discrepancies pertaining to both ruddervators were noted.  The ruddervators were reskinned and rebalanced in October 1982 and the airplane was painted August 1986; no record of balance check was noted after painting (contrary to the shop manual) through the last entry in the maintenance records.  Airworthiness Directive (AD) 94-20-04, effective November 28, 1994, requiring in part balance check of the ruddervators, and a stipulation to repeat the balance check if the ruddervators(s) are repaired or painted.  The compliance section of the AD states, '...unless already accomplished'.  The AD was completed first in October 1995, in July 1997, and last July 1998; no evidence of balance check was annotated in the maintenance records during accomplishment with the AD.  The airplane had accumulated at the time of the accident approximately 79 hours since last compliance with AD 94-20-04 and approximately 156 hours since painting.  The mechanic who first performed AD 94-20-04 in October 1995 stated that the ruddervators were not balance checked then due to the wording of the compliance section that states not required if previously accomplished.  The mechanic also stated that AD 94-20-04 is 'hard to interpret.'  Personnel from the FAA ACO stated that because the AD is subject to interpretation in the field, it may be revised.  Review and analysis of the manufacturers flight test report pertaining to flutter indicated no critical frequency around 38.3 Hertz, which is the frequency when the propeller is operating at 2,300 rpm. Postaccident, the maximum vibration recorded from the engine/propeller was .6 ips; the propeller had been balanced to .15 IPS, 15 months before the accident.  The maximum limit pertaining to attempting to balance the propeller established by the test equipment manufacturer is 1.2 IPS.

Findings in the investigation were 1) improper modification/repair to both propeller blades by unknown person(s) resulting in them being below specification for chord width, and one of the propeller blades being below specification for chord thickness, 2) wrong sized rivets near the trim tab of the right elevator were noted and the skin of both ruddervators was not trimmed correctly, 3) paint drips flowing towards the trailing edge of both ruddervators contrary to shop manual.

The CFI responded that only 15 degrees of flaps were needed. The owner reported, 'during the takeoff run it seemed to me that we had difficulty getting on a good step situation.'  The owner further said, 'at the point where an aborted takeoff should have been executed, I saw him [CFI] reach for what I was certain would be the power and an aborted takeoff. Instead, he [CFI] reached for the flap handle and put the flaps at 35 degrees and horsed back on the controls so that the nose did come up, but there was no way we could avoid hitting the shore which was covered with bull bushes.'  The airplane contacted the high grasses, nosed over, and came to rest inverted 150 feet from the shoreline. The CFI reported, 'I was a little too late in aborting the takeoff.'

The pilot reported that, before the accident flight, he used a calibrated dipstick to determine how much fuel was on board the airplane. The left and right fuel tanks contained 10 and 5 gallons of fuel, respectively. He noted that the skydiving flight typically took a single pass over the landing zone, which required about 20 to 25 minutes of flight time and 8 gallons of fuel; however, the accident flight required two passes over the landing zone at 10,500 feet msl, which added about 2 to 5 minutes to the accident flight. He reported that the flight climbed to 10,500 feet msl and the skydivers were released without any anomalies or malfunctions with the airplane. The pilot immediately initiated a descent to reenter the traffic pattern at the departure airport, and the airplane experienced a loss of engine power while on the downwind leg. A helicopter was approaching the airport at a similar altitude, which delayed the turn onto the base leg. Believing he had insufficient altitude to reach the runway, the pilot performed a forced landing to a field. The nose landing gear collapsed shortly after touchdown, and the airplane subsequently nosed over. Following the accident, the pilot reported to several individuals that the airplane \"ran out of fuel,\" which resulted in the loss of engine power while in the traffic pattern. Additionally, the pilot stated that there were no mechanical issues with the engine before the loss of engine power. During a postaccident examination, 3.5 gallons of fuel were recovered from the airplane.

On short final, approximately 40 feet agl, and 40 mph, the helicopter yawed left slowly.  When the helicopter had reached a 45-degree left yaw, the CFI took the controls.  As the helicopter approached a 90-degree left yaw, the CFI had applied full right pedal.  Simultaneously, he lowered the collective and reduced power.  The helicopter rotated 360 degrees about 3 times before impact.  Post accident inspection revealed incorrect installation of the forward end of the intermediate drive belt on the intermediate pulley group.  The tail rotor drive system uses three belts, interconnected via pulleys at various points within the tail boom, to drive the tail rotor.  The forward and aft belts and pulleys were normal.  The intermediate belt was found shredded, burned, and separated.  The aft end of the intermediate belt was positioned correctly on the rear pulley; however, the forward end was around the wrong pulley, the one meant for the forward belt, which induced a large misalignment of the intermediate belt and consequent rub between it and the pulley side.   All pulleys were installed with specified tightness and with fore/aft play as stated in the maintenance manual.  Maintenance records for the helicopter indicated that the belts were replaced twice in the past 8 months, both times by the manufacturer.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the flight from the Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB), Sanford, Florida to Page Field Airport (FMY), Fort Myers, Florida. The instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. According to preliminary air traffic control (ATC) information, the CFI reported to ATC that the airplane was displaying a low oil pressure indication and he was experiencing smoke in the cockpit. The CFI then declared an emergency with ATC and was provided radar vectors to and cleared for landing at X07. According to witnesses at X07, they watched as the airplane approached  runway 17. They stated that as the airplane reached the runway threshold, it appeared to abort the landing, \"throttle up,\" and continued to fly down the runway. The airplane then made a left turn towards the departure end of runway 6.

The instructor reported that there were no outstanding airworthiness issues with the helicopter.  The accident occurred while he was preparing his student for the private pilot certification check ride.  The lesson plan/maneuver that he intended the student to practice was a run-on landing.  On base leg to runway 21R, while cruising about 60 knots at 300 feet above ground level, the helicopter's nose suddenly yawed left and then right.  Concurrently the helicopter shook, and the clutch light illuminated.  The instructor took the controls from his student and entered an autorotative descent.  About 20 feet above ground level he commenced a cyclic flare for the landing.  The underlying terrain was soft sand, and the helicopter rolled over during touchdown.  Upon exiting the helicopter, the instructor observed that the V-belts were shredded.  A company mechanic had performed a 100-hour inspection about 4.3 hours prior to the accident flight.  During the inspection, he had loosened the self-locking nut on the belt actuator housing assembly and had rotated the down-limit stop screw upward until the screw bottomed out in the actuator housing in the full up position.  The mechanic forgot to reposition the stop screw and tighten the nut.  This action resulted in the main rotor drive V-belts becoming excessively loose.

After spraying the field, the pilot circled for about 15 minutes looking for his intended airport, but he could not locate it. He spotted another airport about 5 miles south of his location and headed in that direction. As he approached to land, he noticed the airport had a control tower. He stated that, because he did not have the capability to radio the tower for a request to land, he aborted the approach, crossed the midfield, and rocked the airplane's wing in an attempt to receive a green light from the control tower signaling approval to land. After not receiving the green light, he made a right turn away from the airport, at which point, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot made an emergency landing in a field about 1 mile southeast of the airport. After the accident, he reported that he had exhausted the airplane's fuel supply. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of usable fuel in the fuel tanks or the vicinity of the accident site and no evidence of preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.After takeoff for an airshow performance, the pilot performed maneuvers consisting of a barrel roll, loop, and an opposing pass with another airplane, culminating with an aileron roll. Witnesses and recorded video indicated that after the two airplanes crossed, the accident pilot began an aileron roll to the left, which degraded into a barrel roll. After completing about 270 degrees of the roll, the airplane stopped rolling and continued in a right-wing-down, nose-low attitude until impact. Review of the video revealed no separation of airplane parts and no obvious attempt by the pilot to recover. Postaccident examination of the airframe and flight controls and a cursory examination of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. According to the pilot's medical records, he developed early onset coronary artery disease and suffered a heart attack (myocardial infarction) at age 46, requiring urgent four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in 2003. One of his grafts failed in the first year, and further intervention by surgery or angioplasty was deemed impossible. The pilot was aggressively treated for high cholesterol following his heart attack and also developed diabetes. Even with intensive treatment, atherosclerosis will predictably continue to develop. Thus, the risk of death and other major adverse cardiovascular events following CABG is significant and increases over time. Studies indicate that by 8 years following CABG surgery, approximately 30 percent of diabetic patients have died; this increases to nearly 40 percent by 12 years. Following his surgery, the pilot applied for a special issuance of his medical certificate. During that process, he did not indicate that he intended to fly aerobatics. The pilot received a special issuance third class medical certificate, which was renewed annually. However, he was not asked again about the types of flying he was doing or intending to do. Although the pilot routinely passed regular exercise stress testing as part of the special issuance requirements, his personal medical records indicated that he had a small area of his heart muscle that was repeatedly identified as at risk on nuclear imaging studies. The sudden changes in cardiac work associated with g-loading and unloading may be an independent risk factor for cardiac arrhythmia in the setting of a scar resulting from previous infarction. Even without g-loading, the risk of arrhythmia is highest in the first minutes, hours, and days after a heart attack. According to autopsy results, the medical examiner found a \"fresh\" area of myocardial infarction (heart attack) on the gross pathology; however, no microscopic analysis was performed. That the medical examiner was able to identify an area of grossly abnormal tissue suggests the event occurred hours to a couple of days previously. A closer approximation of the timing of the pilot's final myocardial infarction could not be determined.The evidence indicates that the pilot likely became impaired or incapacitated while flying a low-altitude aerobatic maneuver soon after suffering a heart attack. The FAA knew about the pilot's medical condition and appropriate procedures had been followed during the evaluation for his aerobatic competency card. Currently, there are no limitations to permitted flight characteristics for special issuance medical certificates, including those issued for cardiac disease.In January 1999, as a result of several investigations involving pilot incapacitation, including accidents during airshow performances, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendations A-99-1 and -2 asking the FAA to, respectively, \"restrict all pilots with special issuance certificates due to cardiac conditions that could affect their g-tolerance from engaging in aerobatic flight\" and \"restrict all pilots taking medication that reduces g-tolerance from engaging in aerobatic flight.\" In evaluating these recommendations, FAA personnel reviewed an NTSB-supplied list of accidents using the following criteria: a) the accident must have occurred during aerobatic flight as defined by applicable FAA advisory circulars and regulations; b) the aerobatic maneuver must have been intentional; c) the aircraft must have been certified for aerobatic flight; d) the maneuver must have been authorized under FAA regulations; and e) the airman's cardiac or medication history must have been documented in his/her FAA medical record at the time of the event. Based on the criteria, the FAA determined that the NTSB recommendations would \"probably not have changed the outcome in any of the accidents.\" Further, the FAA indicated in its review that if there had been a significant number of properly identified pilots experiencing aircraft accidents during authorized aerobatic maneuvers, the recommended actions would be justified. The NTSB classified the recommendations, \"Closed--Reconsidered.\" However, this accident flight meets all five criteria stipulated by the FAA.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's impairment or incapacitation that occurred during a low-altitude aerobatic maneuver due to complications from a recent heart attack, resulting in his inability to maintain control of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's willingness to allow an airman with well-documented, severe coronary artery disease to perform high-risk, low-altitude aerobatic maneuvers."

At the 8,000 feet msl he noticed that he was much closer to the glacier than he expected and decided to turn back. He started a right turn, but the airplane was too low and slow and began to stall.

The pilot informed Macon AFSS that he was aware of the \"swirling mess\" and wondered how far west he would have to fly in order to avoid it. At 1438, the Macon AFSS advised the pilot that the lowest cloud conditions between Thomasville, Georgia, and Gadsden, Alabama were twelve hundred feet, and that the observation was twenty-three minutes old. The current observation showed that the weather conditions were beginning to deteriorate and that the ceiling dropped two hundred feet. A witness reported, on April 10, 2003 between 1630 and 1700 central standard time, a high wing; tail wheel type airplane flew over their home. The witness recalled the weather consisted of low clouds, rain and fog. There were several pilot reports recorded within a 60-mile radius surrounding the time of the accident. All of the reports were identified with pilot's operating under instrument flight rules. The pilot reports were consistent with the base of the overcast layer at 1,500 feel mean sea level with varying tops from 5500 feet west over Birmingham to 11,500 feet west of Atlanta.

The maintenance manager stated that the nose and main landing gear assemblies had \"overheated,\" during the RTO and that each tire had deflated after the airplane came to rest, because \"there was no indication that the tires had skidded.\" During an examination of the airplane, it was determined that the take-off warning horn was the result of a take-off configuration conflict between the inboard and outboard slats. An inspection of the inboard slat drive mechanism's lower left hand anti-torque strut, revealed that a rod-end bearing had migrated out of the rod-end, and that two washers were missing, which allowed the anti-torque strut to ride on the bolt that attaches the rod-end to the slat drive mechanism. ",
            "probable_cause": "the manufacturer's improper installation of the inboard slat drive mechanism's lower left hand anti-torque strut, which resulted in the axial migration of the rod-end bearing, the binding of the anti-torque strut, and the subsequent activation of the slat take-off configuration warning horn. Contributing factors include the aborted take-off, the initiation of normal brakes during a high energy stop, and the main landing gear fire."

Although the pilot was aware that the flight was to be flown using dead reckoning and pilotage, he did not verify the ground checkpoints during the flight, which resulted in his loss of situational awareness. Following departure, the air traffic controller had the pilot fly southeast of the airport. After the pilot cleared the airspace, in an action inconsistent with established visual flight rules (VFR) procedures set by his school, the pilot incorrectly entered a true course rather than a magnetic course into the global positioning system (GPS) onboard the airplane.  In the process of programming the GPS unit, he used a GPS course entry procedure that was only to be used during instrument flight procedures rather than VFR flight navigation. The pilot then activated the autopilot to fly the entered course. During the flight, the airplane entered instrument flight rules conditions and the pilot disconnected the autopilot. The pilot then received a warning on the GPS that the airplane was close to terrain. He began a left turn to return to visual flight rules. During the turn, the airplane impacted the terrain.

The guardrail was located beneath power lines having an approximate elevation of 57 feet above the airport's elevation.  Prior to takeoff, the pilot added 25 gallons of fuel for the planned 43-mile (direct) flight.  This increased the airplane's gross weight to within 34 pounds of its maximum certificated gross weight.  The pilot heard the airport's automated weather broadcast that the density altitude was at least 8,100 feet.  The pilot did not consult the available Piper \"Owner's Handbook\" that indicated the maximum elevation published for takeoff was for a 7,000-foot density altitude condition.  At this altitude, about 3,800 feet are required to takeoff and clear a 50-foot obstacle.  At an 8,100-foot density altitude, an undetermined additional distance would be required.  The pilot allowed the passenger to perform the takeoff.  The passenger held a student pilot certificate, had about 15 hours of total flight time, and had not soloed.  The stall warning light illuminated several times during the approximately 2-minute-long flight, and the pilot took over the controls from the passenger.  A witness observed the airplane 15 to 20 seconds before it crashed.  The witness noted that the airplane was in a nose high pitch attitude, with its nose 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.  Then, the airplane's nose lowered, and the airplane descended until impacting the guardrail.  The pilot subsequently reported that the maximum altitude gained during the flight was about 200 feet above ground level, following which he encountered a downdraft.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The crew stated that the preflight examination, takeoff checks, takeoff roll, and rotation from runway 26 were \"normal.\" However, once airborne, and with the landing gear down and the flaps at 20 degrees, the airplane began a roll to the right. The captain used differential thrust and rudder to keep the airplane from rolling over, and as he kept adjusting both. He noted that as the airspeed increased, the airplane tended to roll more; as the airspeed decreased, the roll would decrease. The captain also recalled thinking that the airplane might have had an asymmetrical flap misconfiguration. Both pilots stated that there were no lights or warnings. As the airplane continued a right turn, runway 13 came into view. The captain completed a landing to the right of that runway, landing long and in the grass with a 9-knot, left quartering tailwind. The airplane then paralleled the runway and ran into an airport perimeter fence beyond the runway's end. The cockpit voice recorder revealed that the crew initially used challenge and reply checklists and that after completing the takeoff checklist, engine power increased. About 7 seconds after the first officer called \"V1,\" the captain stated an expletive, and the first officer announced \"positive rate.\" During the next 50 seconds, the captain repeated numerous expletives, an automated voice issued numerous \"bank angle\" warnings, and the first officer asked what he could do, to which the captain later told him to declare an emergency. There were no calls by either pilot for an emergency checklist nor were there callouts of any emergency memory items. Each of the airplane's wings incorporated four hydraulically-actuated spoiler segments. The outboard segment, the roll control spoiler, normally extends in conjunction with its wing aileron after the aileron has traveled more than about 3 degrees, and extends up to 50 degrees at full control wheel rotation. When the airplane was subsequently examined in a hangar, hydraulic power was applied to the airplane via a ground hydraulic power unit, and the right roll spoiler elevated to 7.9 degrees above the flush wing level. Multiple left/right midrange turns of the yoke, with the hydraulic ground power unit both on and off, resulted in the roll spoiler being extended normally, but still returning to a resting position of 7.8 to 7.9 degrees above the flush position. When the yoke was turned full right and left, whether the aileron boost was on or off, both wings' roll spoilers extended to their full positions per specifications; however, once the full deflection testing was completed, the right roll spoiler returned to 6.1 degrees above the flush position. A final yoke turn resulted in the roll spoiler being elevated to 5.5 degrees.The right wing roll spoiler actuator was subsequently examined at the airplane manufacturer, and the roll spoiler was found to jam. The roll spoiler actuator was disassembled, but no specific reason(s) for the jamming were found. The roll spoiler parts were also examined and no indications of why the actuator may have jammed were found.According to the flight manual, if any of the spoiler segments should float, moving the spoiler hold-down switch to \"Spoiler Hold Down\" locks all spoiler panels down. The roll control spoilers may then be used in the roll mode by turning on the auxiliary hydraulic pump. Also, an \"Aileron/Spoiler Disconnect\" T-handle is available to release the tie between the ailerons and the roll control spoilers in the event of a jam in either system. When used, the pilot's yoke controls only the ailerons, and the copilot's yoke controls only the roll control spoilers. Although the jamming of the right spoiler initiated the event, the crew's proper application of emergency procedures should have negated the adverse effects. Memory items for an uncommanded roll include moving the spoiler hold-down switch to the \"on\" position, which was not done; the spoiler hold-down switch was found in the \"off\" position.  (The captain thought that he may have had an asymmetrical flap configuration; however, if an asymmetry had been the initiating event, the flap system would have been automatically disabled and the flap segments would have been mechanically locked in their positions.) The aileron/spoiler disconnect T-handle was found pulled up, which the crew indicated had occurred when the first officer's shoe hit it as he evacuated the airplane. While pulling the aileron/spoiler disconnect T-handle would have been appropriate for a different emergency procedure to release the tie between the ailerons and the roll control spoilers in the event of a jam in either system, it would have actually hindered the captain's attempts to control the airplane in this case because it would have disconnected the left roll spoiler from the captain's yoke, making it more difficult to counter the effects of the displaced right roll spoiler. Although the crew indicated that the t-handle was pulled during the first officer's exit of the airplane, its position, safety cover, and means of activation make this unlikely. In addition, precertification testing of the airplane showed that even with the right roll spoiler fully deployed, as long as the pilot had the use of the left roll spoiler in conjunction with that aileron, the airplane should have been easily controlled.",
            "probable_cause": "The crew's failure to use proper emergency procedures during an uncommanded right roll after takeoff, which led to a forced landing with a quartering tailwind. Contributing to the accident was a faulty right roll spoiler actuator, which allowed the right roll spoiler to deploy but not close completely."

The individual did not believe the pilot was drunk and asked him if he had been drinking. The pilot replied that he was \"not drunk.\" The individual reported that during the flight, the engine did not \"miss a beat\", but the pilot advised him the oil was getting hot. The individual also reported that during the flight, he noted two lights illuminated on the overhead panel. One of the lights was on the whole time and one red light came on towards the end of the flight. After the red light came on, the pilot immediately proceeded towards the helipad and landed. The accident flight departed from the helipad at about 2042, and according to one witness near the accident site, she observed the helicopter circling then described what she thought was the pilot losing control of the helicopter with the helicopter spinning around the axis of the main rotor, then hearing the main rotor noise increase, followed by a return to circling. She observed that sequence two times. An individual located in the house collided with reported hearing the helicopter followed by the sound of an impact. Two of the three individuals of the house went outside, an observed the helicopter on the roof. Both individuals who went outside went onto the roof to rescue the pilot. One of the individuals later reported smelling the odor of alcohol on the pilot's breath. The pilot was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Hospital records indicate a blood specimen taken approximately 1 hour 40 minutes after the accident was positive for ethanol (136 mg/dL), or .136 percent by weight. A FAA toxicology study of a blood specimen of the pilot taken at the same was positive for ethanol (105 mg//dL), or .105 percent by weight, citalopram (0.017 ug/ml) and zolpidem (0.433 ug/ml). A review of the pilot's medical records revealed his complaint to his private physician on May 23, 2002, was for insomnia and depression. Physical examination includes in part \"Psychiatric: normal mood and affect.\" Impressions were \"Insomnia\" and \"Chronic Depression.\" The same doctor provided 20 mg samples of  Celexa (citalopram) to take 1/2 tablet daily, and prescribed 10 mg Ambien, 1/2 to 1 tablet to be taken orally at bedtime as needed. The medical records from the pilot's private physician do not indicate a request for psychiatric consultation, or an inquiry by the physician regarding suicidal intent, or alcohol/drug use. A review of 14 CFR Part 91.17 indicates no person may act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft while under the influence of alcohol having .04 percent by weight or more in the blood, or while using a drug that affects the person's faculties in any way contrary to safety. The NTSB did not examine the helicopter at the accident site but did examine the helicopter following recovery. Examination of the helicopter revealed flight control continuity was confirmed for collective, cyclic, and the tail rotor. Main and tail rotor drive continuity was confirmed. Without repairs of any to the engine which remained in the helicopter, the damaged main rotor blades were removed, the engine was started and operated for approximately 17 minutes. During the engine run the engine was operated independently using only ignition system No. 1, followed by ignition system No. 2. The engine was also operated independently using the No. 1 FADEC, followed by the No. 2 FADEC. No obvious discrepancies were noted during the engine run. The engine with water pump, and both FADEC units were removed from the helicopter and sent to the helicopter manufacturer's facility for an engine run and readout of the FADEC units. A load was placed on the engine which was started and operated for approximately 19 minutes, no discrepancies were noted during the engine run. Readout of the FADEC primary engine control unit (ECU) revealed that with respect to the accident flight which lasted approximately 48 minutes, the maximum engine coolant temperature recorded was in the green arc (normal range), and no other discrepancies were noted. NTSB personnel did not have an opportunity to discuss the circumstances of the accident with the pilot due to the fact that he was fatally injured in an airplane accident the following morning at approximately 0822 hours, which was approximately 10 hours 52 minutes after the helicopter accident or 5 hours 47 minutes after being released from the hospital.

The student then initiated the takeoff to the west. During the takeoff roll, the airspeed stabilized around 45 MPH, and the instructor advised the student that as soon as the aircraft lifted off it would accelerate.

Two witnesses on the ground reported hearing several \u201cpops\u201d before the airplane banked sharply to the right. The airplane collided with the terrain shortly thereafter. The confined distribution of wreckage was consistent with a low-altitude aerodynamic stall.A witness, who fueled the accident airplane, noted that he did not see the pilot sump the airplane\u2019s fuel tanks during the preflight. Fuel samples obtained after the accident from the fuel strainer assemblies tested positive for water contamination. During the postaccident engine examination, the fuel strainer assemblies were disassembled, and the filter elements, selector valve housing assemblies, and both fuel bowl assemblies exhibited water contamination, rust, and deposits. Visible sediment and rust were observed in several fuel system components on both engines. The airplane\u2019s single-engine performance could not be calculated using the airplane\u2019s performance charts because the airplane was over the maximum weight by 176.85 lbs. Further, the calculated density altitude was 6,108 feet. The surge and a possible power reduction to the right engine was likely due to the fuel contamination. Although the airplane was over its maximum weight and took off in a high density altitude\u2014both of which would have affected the airplane\u2019s performance\u2014the pilot still failed to maintain adequate airspeed and control of the airplane. \u000b",

During the landing, the airplane nosed over. The pilot reported that prior to departure from the lodge, there were 26 gallons of fuel in the right main fuel tank, and 8 to 10 gallons in the left main fuel tank. He commonly used the fuel in the right tank for the flight, and the left tank fuel was the reserve supply. When the engine lost power, he switched fuel tanks, and held the emergency fuel boost pump on for about 3 seconds. When the engine did not respond, he moved the fuel lever back and forth, turned the boost pump on, and moved the fuel mixture control to the full rich position. Unable to restart the engine, he made an off airport emergency landing. The right front seat passenger said that prior to takeoff, he asked the pilot if they had enough fuel, because all four fuel gauges were on or near the empty mark. An examination of the airplane revealed that the right main fuel tank was empty, and about 3 inches of fuel remained in the left main fuel tank. The left header tank was full, and the right header tank contained a small quantity of fuel and water. No mechanical anomalies were found with the fuel system. The engine was test run and it operated satisfactorily.According to the airplane\u2019s Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), the minimum fuel for the flight (without the required VFR reserve) would have been about 26.8 gallons. The POH treats the running of a fuel tank below a usable level in-flight as a normal operating procedure, but has very specific guidelines for engine restart. The pilot did not follow those procedures. The POH does not discuss the altitude lost or time required for a successful engine restart. Considering the witnesses\u2019 observations, the postaccident examination of the fuel system and the successful engine operation, it is likely that the pilot inadvertently ran the right main fuel tank below a usable level.  Due to the low altitude, time available, and his incorrect restart procedure, he was unable to get the engine restarted to avoid an off-airport landing.Eighty-nine fuel related accidents involving Cessna single-engine airplanes were reviewed, disclosing that 52 of those accidents were initiated by a fuel tank either being intentionally or unintentionally run below a usable level.  All 89 accidents resulted from the pilot not being able to get the engine restarted.

The airplane struck trees, the ground, and a stopped car before coming to rest impaled on a pole at a corner auto sales lot.  According to the owner, the airplane had about 20 gallons of fuel in each tank when he dropped off the airplane at the maintenance shop on October 19, 2002, for the 50-hour inspection, and historical experience showed the engine consumed 17.3 gallons per hour in cruise. The mechanic/pilot was conducting a flight test of the autopilot and turbocharger systems following a 50-hour inspection.  He indicated that there was 40 gallons of fuel onboard the airplane prior to takeoff, and the test flight lasted about 45 minutes.  He further reported that the left fuel tank gage read 1/4 tank, and the right fuel tank gage read between 1/4 and 1/2 tank.  When the flight reached the cruise altitude of 16,000 feet, the pilot switched the fuel tank selector, but did not recall which tank he selected.  About 30 minutes into the flight, the pilot told the passenger that they were low on fuel, but that it would be okay.  The passenger noted that both fuel gages read less than 1/4 tank each at that time.  The pilot tested the autopilot for 8 minutes and then returned to the airport for landing.  Prior to entering the airport environment, the pilot switched the fuel selector to the fullest tank, which he believed was the right fuel tank.  The first approach was too high and the pilot requested and received clearance to conduct a go-around in order to lose altitude.  During the second approach, the engine quit.  First responders to the accident site reported seeing fuel leaking from the engine area, and then a fire started.  The airplane sustained fire damage to the cabin and aft engine areas, as well as both wings. The fuel selector was selected to the right fuel tank.  A warning in the fuel systems description section of the manufacturer's approved flight manual states that with 1/4 full or less of fuel in the fuel tanks, prolonged uncoordinated flight (slips or skids) can cause the fuel tank outlets to become uncovered causing fuel starvation and engine stoppage.  A post-accident airframe and engine inspection was conducted with no mechanical anomalies noted.",

The commercial pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and the airplane, which departed Shannon Field (02CD), Clarksdale, Mississippi, was not operating on a flight plan. The local aerial application flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137.According to company personnel and GPS data, the airplane was applying fertilizer in both directions in an east-west race track pattern. After completing each leg, the airplane would make a 20- to 30-degree left turn, followed by a right turn to reverse course and fly the next track. The GPS data ended prior to the final turn.A witness on his lawn mower noted the airplane when it flew over his property about 150 feet above the ground. He heard the airplane's engine running over the sound of the mower, and saw the airplane turn right, to the north, and the wings become vertical. The airplane then impacted the ground, and when it did, the witness saw smoke and  fertilizer being ejected up into air. The witness then went to the wreckage and found the pilot unresponsive.The initial impact occurred on flat terrain in the vicinity of 34 degrees north, 06.34 minutes north latitude, 090 degrees, 34.26 minutes west longitude, at an elevation of about 160 feet. The wreckage path, which began with green lens material, headed about 360 degrees magnetic. Approximately 75 feet beyond the initial impact point, there was a 3-foot-deep, 10-foot-long crater with the propeller hub and four of the five propeller blades partially embedded at its right edge. Beginning about 20 feet beyond the crater, was the fifth propeller blade and the rest of the airplane. The airplane was fractured into multiple sections and pieces, with all flight control surfaces located at the scene. Flight control continuity was confirmed via the control cables from the cockpit to the rudder and elevator, and through push rod and bellcrank fractures to the ailerons.After the airplane's removal to a storage facility, the engine was partially disassembled. Soil was found in the gas generator case and throughout the combustion section, the compressor turbine blade tips exhibited smearing and the turbine shroud exhibited corresponding circumferential rubbing, and the compressor disc outer rim and blade platforms exhibited circumferential rubbing with frictional heat discoloration and material in the vicinity of the 1st stage power turbine vane ring and baffle, all of which was consistent with the engine being under power at impact. One of the five propeller blades exhibited torsional bending, and two blades remaining in the hub left witness marks consistent with propeller pitch being in \"the normal operating range\" and not feathered.",
