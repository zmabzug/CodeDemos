About 20 minutes after departure, the passenger spotted an area of invasive plant species which he wanted to film. The pilot then performed a 360-degree turn and approached the area in straight and level flight, between 30-40 knots to maintain translational lift. The passenger reported that they were  closer than usual as they lined up for the approach. The pilot heard a pitch change in the engine and lowered the collective slightly and increased the throttle; however, the helicopter began to descend.

Examination of a videotape taken by the passenger during the accident sequence revealed that the engine continued to run, with no discernible engine anomalies prior to the accident. According to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Rotorcraft Flying Handbook, \"settling with power\" defines when the helicopter keeps settling even though full engine power is applied.

The private pilot and two passengers sustained minor injuries, while one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to and operated by Header Bug LLC, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Sarasota/Bradenton International Airport (SRQ), Sarasota, Florida, about 0933 EST, and was destined for Orangeburg Municipal Airport (OGB), Orangeburg, South Carolina.The pilot stated that the purpose of the accident flight was pleasure. He intended to fly to OGB, which was the half way mark of the flight; however, the ultimate destination was to an airport in Leesburg, Virginia. After arrival at SRQ the airplane was removed from the hangar and the fuel tanks were filled. He then performed a preflight inspection using the checklist. No fuel contamination was noted and the oil quantity was checked and found to indicate 8 quarts, or full. After engine start he taxied to the run-up area, and while there performed an engine run-up using the checklist. It included a check of the magnetos at 1,700 rpm, and checking the load of the alternators. When the checklist was completed he obtained his IFR clearance, and departed from runway 04.After takeoff the flight proceeded towards the destination airport. The pilot further stated that he checked the engine parameters; noting all readings citing specifically (oil temperature, oil pressure, and CHT) were in the green. About 3 minutes later, while flying at 9,000 feet mean sea level with the mixture leaned to the mark and the engine between 65 and 70 percent power, or 2,400 rpm, he heard an audible warning that the oil pressure was zero. The airplane at that time was near Savannah, or about 50 to 60 miles from OGB. The engine power went to idle, and he did not hear any sounds from the engine which was running smooth but was idled back. He reported he had no control over the power, and did not observe any oil or mist coming out of the engine and did not notice any smoke from the engine from oil getting onto a hot exhaust. He also reported he did not hear a change in sound from the propeller as if the propeller had changed pitch, and the propeller never stopped. The passenger in the right front seat read the display on the multi-function display (MFD) that the oil pressure displayed in the red showing 0 oil pressure. In addition, on the primary flight display (PFD) a red highlighted \"WARNING\" about the oil pressure displayed. He fully enrichened the mixture control and moved the throttle in an attempt to restore engine power but there was no result. Using the on-board avionics he confirmed the nearest airport was 3J0, which ATC confirmed. The controller called to the 3J0 airport to inform personnel there of his situation, and he descended at 98 knots (best glide speed is 88 knots).The pilot stated that after realizing he was unable to land at 3J0, he informed the passengers to tighten their restrains (seatbelts and shoulder harnesses) before activating the CAPS, and pulled the CAPS activation handle at 800 feet; he did not recall the airspeed at chute pull. He reported that the engine stayed at idle during the descent, and while under canopy, the tail came down just as the airplane hit the trees. He attributed this to the altitude of deployment. A portion of a wing was knocked off and the tail was almost separated. The airplane descended to the ground, and he reported the contact was hard.The airplane came to rest about \u00be nautical mile and 110 degrees from the approach end of runway 29 at 3J0.Preliminary inspection of the airplane revealed the right wing was fractured at the outboard end of the flap, and the empennage was fractured just forward of the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer.

The trip consisted of a 261-nautical mile (nm) leg, a refueling stop, and a 271-nm leg. After completing the first leg, the airplane was refueled with 25 gallons of aviation fuel. During the second leg, as the airplane reached a position about 10 nm from the destination airport, the engine lost power. The pilot restarted the engine, and it ran for a few minutes before losing power again. The pilot was unfamiliar with the area and did not see the destination airport until the airplane was directly over the airport. He realized the airplane was too high and added full flaps and \"started to side-slip the airplane to lose our excessive altitude.\" Initially, the pilot maneuvered the airplane for a landing on runway 06; however, he was still too high, so he executed a 180-degree turn and landed on runway 24.

The video begins with the airplane on its takeoff roll, accelerating almost 2/3 down the runway before getting airborne.  The windsock at the approach end of the runway appeared limp, indicating little to no wind. Once airborne the airplane climbed to approximately 40 feet, the wings began to wobble, and it settled back down to the ground into the rising terrain off the end of the runway, slid on the ground, and abruptly flipped over onto its back. Immediately after liftoff the plane is observed to crab to the left about 7 degrees while remaining over the runway centerline, indicating the airplane went from a calm wind condition to suddenly being affected by a left crosswind very early in the initial climb.  A video study concluded that the airplane's ground speed was 80 plus or minus 4 knots as it crossed the end of the runway, speeds consistent with the POH recommended speed for the climb.  The airplane was equipped with an engine turbonormalizing system which, according to the supplemental type certificate (STC), allowed for an increase in gross weight to 4,000 pounds when operated in the normal category.  The outside air temperature was 96 degrees F and the field elevation is 1,286 feet msl, which resulted in a density altitude of 4,125 feet.  The airplane's weight at the time of takeoff was 4,095 pounds.  The airplane was also instrumented with a JPI EDM-800 Engine Analyzer. The data revealed consistent engine operation throughout the takeoff and climb at a power level between 91 and 94 percent. The highest terrain elevation directly ahead of the airplane was 1,350 feet msl, approximately 4,860 feet from the point the airplane started its takeoff roll.  The elevation difference between the point the airplane left the runway and the elevated terrain directly ahead was 80 feet.  Based on the STC documentation, the calculated takeoff distance to clear a 50-foot object was 4,030 feet.  An independent computer model simulating the performance of the airplane at a weight of 4,100 pounds and 4,100 feet msl density altitude resulted in the airplane climbing at 911 feet per minute and clearing the terrain directly ahead of it by 148 feet.  The pilot reported that shortly after takeoff he felt a gust of wind from the left.  The video depicts no wind at the midfield windsock and a left crosswind at the departure end, with trees in the background waving in what appears to be a moderate breeze.  No determination could be made regarding whether the crosswind that was encountered had a tailwind or headwind component.  Based on all the evidence it is likely that the airplane encountered a sudden wind from the left in the takeoff initial climb that degraded the airplane's climb performance and led to a stall mush condition.",

Due to area\u00a0weather forecasts of marginal visual meteorological conditions (VMC) to instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) conditions, the pilot had the flight dispatcher file an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan in the event that he had to execute an IFR approach at his destination.\u00a0The first 20 minutes of the flight were conducted in VMC about 2,500 ft mean sea level (msl) and were uneventful. During the final 10 minutes of the flight, the helicopter was nearing IMC, which included high overcast and midlevel scattered to broken clouds with light to moderate rain showers and reduced visibility. The pilot began a climb\u00a0to 4,000 ft msl and then contacted an air traffic controller to activate the IFR flight plan. During this time, both the flight paramedic and flight nurse told the pilot that they were not comfortable entering the worsening weather conditions. Upon reaching 4,000 ft msl,\u00a0the pilot engaged the autopilot in altitude hold mode, and the helicopter then abruptly pitched down 90 degrees and began spinning with the airspeed increasing. The pilot\u00a0identified a disagreement between the pilot and copilot attitude director indicators, turned the autopilot off, and moved his scan to the backup attitude director indicator. The pilot then attempted an unusual attitude recovery by initiating back pressure on the cyclic control; however, the helicopter continued to descend rapidly through the bottom of the cloud base very close to the ground. The helicopter subsequently touched down in a level attitude, bounced several times, and skidded to a stop. All three occupants were assisted from the wreckage by ground personnel.Examination of the flight control systems did not reveal any anomalies that\u00a0might have contributed to the accident. A review of the helicopter\u2019s maintenance history revealed that other company pilots had reported several occurrences of uncommanded pitch-and-roll anomalies with the helicopter during the previous several years. Maintenance inspections after these occurrences could not duplicate the reported problems, and the helicopter was always returned to service after successful flight control systems check flights. After the accident, the autopilot system, gyros, and servo components were examined, and no preimpact anomalies were found; however, the solid-state components could not be tested for functionality due to damage.\u00a0The reason for the reported in-flight control anomaly could not be determined. The flight paramedic and flight nurse said that they lost visual reference to the ground during the in-flight upset. Therefore, it is possible that the transition from VMC to IMC led to the pilot becoming spatially disoriented while he was trying to recover from the reported upset and that this prevented him from recovering from it; however, investigators could not definitively determine if the pilot became spatially disoriented. Regardless, it is likely that an earlier transition from VFR to IFR flight before encountering IMC would have given the pilot a better chance to recover from the reported autopilot system-induced anomaly and would have reduced the possibility of his becoming spatially disoriented.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

The crew declared an emergency and diverted to Chicago, Illinois.  A landing was made at Chicago O'Hare International Airport with all engines operating and electrical generating power restored.  The investigation revealed that the airplane was modified by Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) to replace the original Pratt and Whitney engines with Rolls Royce Model TAY engines, but using the original fuel system.  The original system was subject to fuel surges which were acceptable to the original installation.  With the TAY engine configuration, when the airplane's fuel system is configured with one engine operating in suction feed, air and vapor evolve from the fuel in the engine and airplane fuel systems, and accumulates at the fuel system high points.  When boosted fuel is restored to the system, the boosted fuel flow rate moves toward the high end of the boost pump output capacity, causing a rapid filling and recompression of the air and vapor areas with a resulting high flow velocity.  The fuel is then decelerated to 'engine demand flow rate' as it reaches the engine high-pressure fuel pump.  This change in the velocity of the fuel flow causes a 'pressure spike' which is first observed at the inlet to the engine high-pressure fuel pump.  The formation of the pressure spike is accompanied by a rapid drop in engine high-pressure fuel pump output and fuel burner line pressures leading to a collapse in engine combustor discharge pressure and engine flameout.  The formed pressure spike travels from the first engine back through the airplane's fuel system into the other exposed engines causing these engines to flameout in a similar manner.  The elapsed time at which the pressure spike travels back through the fuel system to the other engines is just under one second. ",
            "probable_cause": "low pressure in the fuel lines caused when the crossfeed valve was closed and the boost pumps to the  effected fuel tank were turned off, a fuel pressure surge (spike) accompanied by a rapid drop in high pressure pump output and burner line pressures, when boosted fuel was reintroduced to the system, which resulted in temporary fuel starvation to the three engines, and the inadequate aircraft/equipment design by production personnel (STC holder).

The glider veered off the runway and collided with a spectator and an automobile.  The spectator was located ahead of the glider, but within an area that was supposed to be devoid of personnel.  The pilot's ground crew was supposed to support the glider's wing during the beginning of the takeoff until the pilot acquired sufficient aerodynamic control to prevent the wings from contacting the ground.  However, when the glider was connected to the tow plane, the tow plane never came to a complete stop.  During the takeoff, the glider was accelerated in a slingshot manner out of the ground crew's hand.  The accident occurred during a sanctioned Soaring Society of America aviation event (air race) known as the United States 15-Meter National Soaring Championships.  Event spokespersons acknowledged that the area in where the collision occurred, called the \"clear zone,\" had not been identified with specific markers, \"Do Not Cross\" signs, or physical barriers.  They indicated, however, that the injured spectator was familiar with the airport, and evidently was 3.5 feet closer to the runway than he should have been, for personal reasons.  The lateral distance between the runway's edge and the spectator was 78 feet.  The pilot subsequently reported that had he held his brakes until the towrope was tight and stable, he would not have lost control.  Also, the pilot reported that as soon as he observed that his course was diverging from the runway centerline, he could have pulled the tow release thus aborting the takeoff.  Several of the aviation event's management and organization officials witnessed the accident.  The National Soaring Championships Chair reported that, henceforth, its procedures were being changed by keeping the area in front of the glider's takeoff paths clear of nonparticipant personnel and vehicles.",

After takeoff from the departure airport, the 77-year old pilot contacted Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) at 1019 and wanted VFR advisories to his destination.  When radar contact was established, the controller noted that the airplane was nearly in an active restricted area.  The controller assisted the pilot to navigate around the restricted area as the flight climbed to a mode C reported altitude of 6,500 feet.  A short time later, the pilot asked the controller to help him find the destination airport and the controller gave the pilot a suggested heading to fly.  At 1037, the pilot ceased talking on the radio and attempts by the controller to reestablish contact by using other airborne airplanes to relay messages was unsuccessful.  The controller reported that the airplane then began a left descending spiral turn.  Recorded radar data revealed that the airplane climbed at an average rate of 500 feet per minute until 6,500 feet, which was achieved at 1039:41.  After that time, the airplane continued to climb with rates that varied from zero to 500 feet per minute.  At 1045:28, the airplane reached 7,300 feet, then began a descent for 1 minute down to 7,100 feet, then a climb back to 7,300.  At 1047:04, the mode C altitude reports showed a descent at an average rate of just over 1,000 feet per minute in a left descending spiral turn with about a 2,000-foot diameter, which continued in excess of 900 degrees (at least 2 1/2 complete turns).  The rate of descent computed from the mode C altitude reports began about 500 feet per minute and increased to about 1,500 feet per minute by the time of the last two secondary beacon returns.  The last secondary beacon return showed a mode C reported altitude of 4,100 feet and was located about 0.6 nautical miles east of the impact location.

About 2000, the pilot and three passengers boarded the helicopter for the return flight to FDK; however, they subsequently returned to the airport terminal because of poor weather conditions. According to witnesses at the airport, the pilot checked the weather while at the terminal several times. Further, he called a fellow employee of Advanced Helicopter Concepts (the operator of the helicopter), who lived about 4 miles from FDK, twice to ask about weather conditions at the airport. About 2100, the employee informed the pilot that the weather conditions were \u201cmiserable\u201d with severe thunderstorms in the area. Sometime between 2200 and 2215, the employee told the pilot that the rain had stopped; however, he stated that it was still foggy and windy with lightning in the area. On both occasions, the employee offered to drive the helicopter occupants back to FDK; however, the pilot declined the offers. A 2210 weather observation taken at FDK, located about 15 miles southeast of the accident site at an elevation of 303 feet above mean sea level (msl), indicated the following: visibility of 10 statute miles, thunderstorms and light intensity rain, and scattered clouds at 800 and 8,000 feet. A witness on the ground near the accident site reported that it was a \u201cdark night\u201d (civil twilight ended at 2101, and only 4 percent of the moon\u2019s visible disk was illuminated) and that fog was present about 50 feet above the roadway surface. Given that the helicopter was only certified to be operated under visual flight rules, the pilot exercised poor judgment when he chose to fly back to FDK in dark night and adverse weather conditions. The helicopter took off about 2215 and was flying over an interstate highway toward FDK when it entered an area of reduced visibility. The helicopter subsequently struck an unmarked, steel guy-wire that extended perpendicularly over the interstate, near the top of a mountain, and then crashed. During the final 2 minutes of the flight, the helicopter was flying at level flight about 1,100 feet above msl as the terrain elevation rose from about 600 to 1,200 feet above msl. A witness observed the helicopter fly into clouds and reverse direction just before impact. The accident sequence is consistent with controlled flight into an obstacle that the pilot most likely did not see because of the dark night conditions and reduced visibility. The helicopter was equipped with a radar altimeter. Further, Robinson Helicopter Safety Notice SN-16 advises pilots to constantly be on alert for power lines because \u201cflying into wires, cables, and other objects is by far the number one cause of fatal accidents in helicopters\u201d and to \u201calways maintain at least 500 feet AGL [above ground level], except during take-off and landing.\u201d Safety Notice SN-26 states, \u201cMany fatal accidents have occurred at night when the pilot attempted to fly in marginal weather...when it is dark, the pilot cannot see wires\u2026Even when he does see it, he is unable to judge its altitude because there is no horizon for reference.\u201d",

When he was about 10 miles south-southeast of the non-towered destination airport, he heard the pilot of a twin-engine airplane report that he was approaching the same airport from the north. The wind favored a landing on runway 32, and the turboprop pilot planned to fly a straight-in approach for landing on that runway. When the turboprop pilot was on final approach for runway 32 about 5 miles from the airport, he heard the twin-engine pilot announce that he was on the left base leg of the traffic pattern for runway 14. As the turboprop pilot continued the approach about 2 miles from the airport, he observed the twin-engine airplane on his traffic display; at that time, the twin-engine airplane was still about 6 miles from the airport. Constant radio transmissions from aircraft at two other non-towered airports in the vicinity precluded the turboprop pilot from communicating clearly with the twin-engine pilot to coordinate their arrivals. Based on the information from his traffic display, the turboprop pilot continued his straight-in approach for runway 32.

The pilot reported that about '2 hours' into the flight, he switched '...from the right tip tank to right main.'  About 3 to 5 minutes later '...the engine stopped, and the propeller was windmilling.'  He attempted a re-start without successes.' The flight was being vectored to an airport, but the pilot said he could not maintain altitude, and elected to land in an open field, separating one of the airplane's wings during the landing.  An engine test run was performed under the supervision of the FAA, on March 19, 1999.  Before starting the engine, the fuel screen was removed from the fuel servo, fuel was found, minimal sediment and no water were found.  Fuel was found in the flow divider.  The continuity of the mixture control was confirmed with free travel, stop to stop.  The throttle was limited in travel from idle to half throttle due to the cockpit control being bent. The engine run revealed, on start up, that the engine exhaust emitting black smoke and the engine ran rough.  When the mixture control was leaned out to about half travel, the black smoke stopped, and the engine ran smoothly.  At idle the oil pressure gauge indicated minimum oil pressure.  The engine was shut down using the mixture control and restarted several more times with the same results as on the first run.  When the throttle control was advanced without first leaning out the mixture control, the engine would quit.  When the mixture was moved from the lean position to the full rich position with the engine running, the engine would again run rough, emit black smoke and then die within several seconds.  On June 14, 1999, the Precision Fuel Servo Injector, model RSA-10ED1, S/N 8791, was flow tested under the supervision of the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC).  The flow test revealed that the servo was running rich at the idle setting, and 'off' idle setting, but was found within specifications at the higher rpm settings.  The Fuel Servo Injector, was received at the Miami NTSB office via FedEX Pak on April 1, 1999.  The package remained in the FedEX Pak (envelope) until flow tests were conducted, when the IIC arranged to have the unit flow tested at a service dealer in the area.  The unit was removed from the FedEX Pak, wrapped in a single piece of plastic, and no padding.  After removal, it was observed that the only external damage was to the mixture control lever which was bent, and jammed in the full rich position.  The FAA inspector revealed that the mixture lever was not damaged when he turned the unit over to someone in his office for shipping.  It was concluded that the mixture arm was damaged after it left the FAA office in Atlanta and before it reached the NTSB office in Miami, and that the damage was caused in shipping the unit in an unprotected container.  The damaged mixture control lever did not have any effect on the fuel servo flow test. ",

After reaching a final approach position at approximately 100 feet agl, he began to demonstrate how to complete an approach with an \"Anti-Torque Failure - Fixed Thruster Setting.\"  He established the helicopter on a \"shallow\" approach angle with a deceleration attitude of approximately 15 to 20 degrees nose up and approximately 300 feet per minute rate of descent.  The flight profile \"appeared normal\" until about 50 to 60 feet above ground level when the helicopter started to descend at a higher than desired rate for demonstration.  The pilot applied collective lever control and a shudder was felt in the rotor system, followed by an increase in descent rate.  Collective lever application could not arrest the descent.  The helicopter struck the ground hard in a nose high attitude, ballooned into the air approximately 3 to 5 feet and slowly rotated approximately 360 degrees.  The \"thruster\" was jammed in the neutral position, but he had no problem landing the helicopter from a hover with power.  The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the Notar Anti-Torque rotating thruster cone, the aft cross tube, and both landing gear skids.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control due to inadvertent settling with power resulting in a hard landing.  Contributing factors include the improperly planned approach, the high density altitude, and the encounter with vortex ring state."

He successfully completed \"a few\" solo takeoffs and landings when the winds increased, which prompted him to switch to a field adjacent to the one he was using. On short final, the aircraft drifted towards trees to the right of the nominal approach path. The pilot initiated a go-around, and applied control inputs that were intended to correct the flight path to the left. The pilot's control inputs caused the aircraft to turn right, and it collided with the trees. The impact resulted in substantial damage to the aircraft, and serious injuries to the pilot. The pilot had approximately 700 hours in airplanes, and was learning to fly the accident aircraft. The pitch and directional control inputs for a weight-shift aircraft were opposite those required for an airplane. The flight instructor and student were cognizant of the potential for problems caused by the difference in required control inputs, but neither observed any tendency of the student to make incorrect inputs on any previous flights. The pilot stated that on the accident approach, he reverted to his original training, which was correct for a conventional airplane, but incorrect for the accident aircraft.",
