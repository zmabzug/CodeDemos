The pilots, after several attempts, were able to get one engine restarted as the airplane was descending through 10,000 feet and diverted to a nearby airport.  Testing of the engines immediately after the incident revealed that they were operating correctly.  Testing of the fuel revealed that it conformed to the specifications for Jet A, but the fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) was significantly below the required concentration.  The investigation of two subsequent dual-engine flame out incidents revealed the FSII was not a factor.  Convective weather can lift significant amounts of water into the upper atmosphere that then form ice crystals.  Research indicates that the ice crystals can partially melt passing through the JT15D-5 engine fan that can then accrete to an internal compressor stator.  When any accreted ice was shed from the stator vanes, it would pass through the high pressure compressor and could be picked up by the pressure sense line to the fuel control.  Flight tests confirmed that sense line could go below freezing at low power settings at high altitude.  Other tests showed that if the sense line was blocked and the power levers were retarded, the electronic engine control would reduce the fuel flow to reduce the power, but the sense pressure within the fuel control would be maintained.  But when the blockage was cleared, the sudden reduction in the sense pressure in the fuel control would result in a reduction of the fuel flow at a rate that was much faster than a normal rapid power reduction and could result in the engine flaming out.  ",
            "probable_cause": "High-altitude ice crystals that had accreted on the compressor vanes and were ingested into the high pressure compressor when the pilots retarded the power levers causing compressor surges and flameouts of both engines.  Contributing factors were the lack of training on the hazards of high-altitude ice crystals to gas turbine engines and guidance to the pilots to activate the engine anti-ice system in conditions where high-altitude ice crystals may exist."

A SIGMET for severe thunderstorms, hail, and cloud tops to 45,000 feet was in effect for the area surrounding the takeoff and accident sites. Shortly after the balloon lifted off on the accident flight, the ground crew was advised of a severe storm warning for the area and observed the storm on radar via their cellular telephones. The crew contacted the pilot by radio to advise him that the storm was growing quickly. The pilot informed the ground crew that he would attempt to climb over the storm but shortly thereafter expressed doubts that the balloon would be able to rise over it.The ground crew watched the balloon disappear into the clouds but continued to receive altitude and weather updates from the pilot via radio. The pilot described being battered by wind and heavy hail, and the altitude updates came quickly as the balloon climbed in an updraft. Around 12,000 feet, the pilot repeated, \"I don't think I'm going to get over this thing.\" About 17,000 feet, the pilot advised that the balloon was descending and stated, \"I got nothing over my head.\" In his last transmission to the crew, at an altitude of 2,000 feet, the pilot advised that he had the ground in sight. The crew dialed 911 and drove the chase vehicle in the direction where they thought the balloon would land. As they pursued the balloon through the storm, they experienced hard rain and hail \"the size of golf balls.\" All major components of the balloon were recovered and a detailed examination indicated multiple envelope tears, including a few small puncture holes consistent with contact with trees. Several lines of the outer sheath had burned away, but the lines were intact with no evidence of fraying or wear. Video footage taken by parachutists during the balloon's ascent on the accident flight captured audio of the pilot's conversation with the ground crew and provided visual evidence of the developing storm as the balloon entered the base of the clouds. The footage then showed parachutists exit from the basket well after the balloon had entered the clouds and visual contact with the ground had been lost. According to the balloon manufacturer's emergency procedure for weather deterioration during flight, pilots should \"land immediately rather than fly into severe atmospheric turmoil\u2026Severe atmospheric forces are capable of taking over and exposing the flight to the hazards of immense envelope stresses and uncontrollable contact with the ground\u2026\"",

On short final the aircraft's Electronic Flight Information System recorded the pilot pitching the aircraft's nose up to nearly +14 degrees and the aircraft's airspeed began to rapidly bleed off making it difficult for both front seat occupants to ascertain runway alignment.  The aircraft then landed very hard and far right of centerline with the left wheel within 3 feet of the south edge of the pavement and the right wheel on down sloping gravel.  The aircraft then veered further right off the runway as the pilot applied power for a go-around, with the aircraft eventually impacting conifer trees growing 30 feet south of the runway's edge.",

The FDR data also showed that during the previous landing (made by another aircrew), the airplane touched down at about 140 knots. Subsequently, the airplane ran off the departure end of the runway and stopped about 250 feet onto the overrun area where it encountered mud.

He and two other men with him saw the airplane below the clouds.  As the airplane proceeded downwind, it momentarily entered a cloud.  As the airplane came out of the cloud, it turned left in about a 30 degree turn.  The angle of bank increased to about 70 to 80 degrees, the tail of the airplane came up, and the airplane impacted the ground nose first.  Several pilots at the airport heard someone from N69BS make a radio transmission on the UNICOM frequency.  What was heard by several people was that N69BS had broken out at 2200 feet.  They then heard, 'N69BS turning base,' immediately followed by 'lookout' and 'oh ....'  All of the eye witnesses agreed that at no time did they see or hear any problems with the engine.  They all said that the sounds coming from the engine never changed.  The published approach in use at the time of the accident was the GPS (global positioning system) runway 12.

The pilot departed on the last parachute drop flight at an undetermined time, completed the parachute drop, and descended with power on. The pilot did not apply carburetor heat during the descent because the carburetor heat control cable was stuck, and would not move for the last two days. The pilot entered the traffic pattern for Runway 13 on a right base leg, and completed the before landing check. The pilot turned final at 500 feet. and the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot checked the magnetos to ensure the magnetos were on the \"both\" position, established a glide, and verified the fuel selector valve was in the \"both\" position. The pilot realized she could not make the runway and made a forced landing adjacent to the airport. The airplane collided with the tops of 60 foot trees, the nose of the airplane pitched down, and the airplane collided with the ground in a left wing low nose down attitude. The airplane received structural damage to both wings and the empennage. The pilot informed the FAA that she had performed maintenance on the carburetor heat control cable by applying a silicone coating to the cable. The cable worked about two days and stuck again. The pilot does not hold a mechanics certificate with ratings for airframe and power plant. No entry was made in the airplane log book concerning the maintenance on the carburetor heat control cable. The nearest weather reporting system to the airport was Jacksonville International Airport, Jacksonville, Florida, located 17 nautical miles to the southwest. The temperature was 88-degrees and the dew point temperature was 61 degrees Fahrenheit. The field elevation at the destination airport is 24 feet. Review of the icing probability chart indicates the airplane will encounter serious icing conditions at glide power. Review of the Cessna Skylane and 182 Owner' s Manual states, \"During climb, watch the engine for any sign of icing-roughness or loss of manifold pressure. Remember, icing will not produce a drop in rpm after you have set up climb power, since the propeller will change pitch to compensate for the power loss. If the engine begins to ice, apply full carburetor heat at once. Review of the Cessna Operating Check List on page 2-5 states in \"LET-DOWN (3) Apply sufficient carburetor heat to prevent icing, if icing conditions exist.\" Review of the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual Supplement for the airplane revealed STC No. SA01944CH had been issued for the use of unleaded automotive gasoline or 82 UL avgas on March 2, 2004. The Flight Manual Supplement states on page 18, (4) \"Carburetor Ice, When using unleaded automotive gasoline, the onset of carburetor ice may occur earlier under the same atmospheric  conditions when using 80/87 minimum grade aviation gasoline.

The CFI said that while in level flight at 1,600 feet msl, as the airplane approached the accident airport, he closed the engine throttle, and told the pilot that he was simulating an engine failure, then instructed the pilot to make an emergency descent and landing at the airport ahead. During the simulated emergency descent, the CFI momentarily advanced the engine throttle to ensure engine power was still available, and the engine appeared to respond accordingly. As the approach progressed, the pilot lowered the landing gear, and the airplane's descent rate increased significantly. The CFI instructed the pilot to go-around when he realized that the airplane was too low on the approach. The pilot immediately applied full engine throttle, but the engine did not respond, and he selected an area of grass-covered terrain as a forced landing site. During the forced landing the airplane struck a perimeter fence, and the nose and main landing gear collapsed. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings. An NTSB postaccident inspection disclosed no evidence any preimpact mechanical problems. An aviation weather reporting station indicated that the temperature was 54 degrees F, and the dew point was 32 degrees F. When these values are entered into a carburetor icing probability chart, the results are in the \"Serious icing-glide power\" category. Both pilots reported that carburetor heat was not used during the simulated emergency descent and approach. A pilot that landed about 15 minutes after the accident reported that while on approach, his airplane's engine developed carburetor ice, which required the use of carburetor heat. Given the lack of any mechanical anomalies it is likely that the formation of carburetor ice resulted in the loss of engine power.",

All of the airplanes fighting the fire were TS-2A's, painted in identical paint schemes.  The Air Tactical Group Supervisor (AirTac) was orbiting clockwise 1,000 feet above the tankers, who were in a counterclockwise orbit at 3,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  The pilots of both aircraft involved in the collision had previously made several drops on the fire.  Records from the Air Tac show that Tankers 86, 91, and 92 were in orbit, and investigation found that Tanker 87 was inbound to enter the orbit after reloading at a nearby airport base.  AirTac would write down the tanker numbers as they made their 3-minutes-out call, and usually ordered their drops in the same order as their check-in.  The AirTac's log recorded the sequence 86, 91, 21, and 92.  The log did not contain an entry for Tanker 87.  Other pilots on frequency did not recall hearing Tanker 87 check in.  Based on clock codes with 12-o'clock being north, the tankers were in the following approximate positions of the orbit when the collision occurred.  Tanker 92 was at the 2-o'clock position; Tanker 86 was turning in at the 5-o'clock position; and Tanker 91 was in the 7-o'clock position.  The AirTac's log indicated that Tanker 92 was going to move up in sequence and follow Tanker 86 in order to drop immediately after him.  Post accident examination determined that Tanker 92's flaps were down, indicating that the pilot had configured the airplane for a drop.  Tanker 92 swung out of the orbit wide (in an area where ground witnesses had not seen tankers all day) to move behind Tanker 86, and the pilot would likely have been focusing on Tanker 86 out of his left side window.  Tanker 87 was on line direct to the center of the fire on a path that witnesses had not observed tankers use that day.  Reconstruction of the positions of the airplanes disclosed that Tankers 86 and 91 would have been directly in front of Tanker 87, and Tanker 92 would have been wide to his left.  Ground witnesses said that Tanker 87 had cleared a ridgeline just prior to the collision, and this ridgeline could have masked both collision aircraft from the visual perspective of the respective pilots.  The right propeller, engine, and cockpit of Tanker 92 contacted and separated the empennage of Tanker 87.  The propeller chop was about 47 degrees counterclockwise to the longitudinal axis of Tanker 87 as viewed from the top.  The collision appeared to have occurred about 2,500 feet, which was below orbit altitude.  CDF had no standard operating manual, no established reporting or entry point for the holding orbits, and a tanker could enter any point of the orbit from any direction.  While no standardized procedures were encoded in an operating manual,  a CDF training syllabus noted that a tanker was not to enter an orbit until establishing positive radio contact with the AirTac.  The entering tanker would approach 1,000 feet below AirTac's altitude and stay in a left orbit that was similar to a salad bowl, high and wide enough to see and clear all other tankers until locating the tanker that it was to follow, then adjust speed and altitude to fall in behind the preceding airplane.",

However, the pilot overshot the final approach course and decided to perform a missed approach. While climbing during the missed approach, the pilot requested and was cleared to fly a global positioning satellite (GPS) approach to the airport. The pilot was maneuvering in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) to set up for the GPS approach when the airplane departed controlled flight and impacted terrain. The airplane fragmented and a postcrash fire ensued. Crush angles on fragmented pieces of the airplane indicated the airplane struck the ground in a left descending turn at high speed. Radar data showed the airplane maneuvering north-northeast of the airport in a left descending turn before it disappeared from radar. The weather conditions at the airport at the time of the accident were reported as a 500-foot overcast ceiling and 10 miles visibility. According to the pilot\u2019s records, in the 5 months since he received his instrument rating, he had logged 0.7 hours of instrument time. His total time logged as flying in actual instrument conditions was 11 hours. Additionally, the pilot received his multiengine airplane rating 2 months before the accident and had logged 28.7 total hours of multiengine airplane flight time.

Although they noted an occasional odor, it was not strong enough to indicate a definite origin.  There was no evidence of a fire.  A post-incident review determined the engine bleed air pressure regulator had failed, allowing unregulated bleed air into the deice system.  The temperature of the unregulated P3 air may be as high as 607 degrees Fahrenheit.  The bleed air is routed through a supply line which runs through the left side door post.  The line is constructed of thin-walled aluminum tubing and is wrapped in anti-chaffing tape.  The source of the smoke was the tape which became overheated due to the unregulated bleed air.

The elevators fluttered and separated from the airplane.  Thereafter, the stabilizers departed, the nose pitched downward, and both wings failed in a negative direction.  A ground witness heard a 'pop' sound, and observed airplane parts falling from the low clouds; the surface winds were reported by the witness as gusty.  Earlier during the flight, the pilot had been cruising about 19,000 feet, and tracking in a southerly direction at 191 knots (ground speed).  The winds aloft were westerly.  While communicating with flight watch and radar controllers, he indicated that his airplane was not equipped with deicing equipment.  The pilot was advised that icing conditions existed between 13,000 and 15,000 feet, and the freezing level was 7,000 feet.  Due to traffic, at 0923 the controller cleared the pilot to descend to 15,000 feet.  The pilot accepted the clearance, and requested a clearance to divert to a nearby airport.  The controller approved the request.  During the last 24 seconds of radar-recorded flight, the airplane's rate of descent increased to 3,500 feet per minute, and over its southerly course its ground speed increased to 240 knots.  Shortly after this at 0930:21, the sound of an emergency locator beacon was recorded in the radar control facility.  Pilot reports covering the area of the accident around the time of the event reported light to moderate turbulence and light to moderate rime/clear icing conditions.
