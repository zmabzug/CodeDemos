The airport is located on a plateau, with terrain that drops off steeply at both ends of the single runway.  Wind gusts at the runway surface were recorded at 38 knots.  According to FAA publication AC 00-57 - \"Hazardous Mountain Winds and Their Visual Indicators,\" strong winds that are at the crest of a ridge or level with a mountain peak can create moderate or greater turbulence, strong up and down drafts, and very strong rotor and shear zones.  Wind shear is defined as \"A sudden, drastic shift in wind speed, direction, or both that may occur in the horizontal or vertical plane.\"  A pilot, who had landed at the airport just before the accident airplane, reported severe turbulence and a 30-knot windshear at the approach end of the runway, and transmitted that information to the accident pilot.  According to witnesses, the accident airplane appeared to get low and slow while on final, likely encountered an abrupt wind shear zone, and descended below the elevation of the approach end of the runway.  To maintain the airplane flying, and to avoid the terrain, the pilot would have had to raise the nose, which increased the wings angle of attack, and therefore, decreased the stall margin.  As it dropped below the level of the runway, a witness reported that the airplane assumed a nose high attitude, and the engine sounded as if it were operating at high rpm and \"straining against the wind.\"  The wing tips wobbled up and down, indicative of a stall, before the airplane rolled to the right and impacted rising terrain short of the runway.  According to another pilot who routinely flew with the accident pilot, the accident pilot routinely flew approaches that were shallower than the 3.5-degree glide slope approach path that is recommended at this airport, which is equipped with a precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lighting system set to 3.5 degrees.  In this instance, the pilot let the airplane drop well below the recommended glide slope during the approach to this runway.  Medications that were identified in the pilot's toxicological report had been prescribed to treat his ongoing medical conditions and relieve pain.While the medications can cause impairment or spatial disorientation, the clear weather on this day, the low levels of medication found in the pilot's system (suggesting no recent use), and the circumstances of the accident make it unlikely that the medications had an effect on the pilot's ability to control the aircraft. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate compensation for the high wind conditions and wind shear encounter on final approach, that led to a failure to maintain an adequate airspeed and a stall. "

Examination of the fractured propeller mounting flange revealed a separation of the propeller mounting flange from the remainder of the crankshaft which was the result of fatigue cracking that initiated between the lightening holes in the flange.  There is an Airworthiness Directive and Service Bulletin that specifically addressed the subject engine when it is installed on the Piper PA-30 airplane. These inspection requirements arose because of cracking problems generated by bending of the mounting flange under certain aerobatic-type maneuvers, primarily maneuvers that add stresses from gyroscopic action.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.About 20 minutes before the accident, the pilot reported to the air traffic controller that he had a problem with an engine and needed to shut the engine down. The flight had just leveled at 23,000 feet. The controller told the pilot that he was near Jackson, Tennessee, and that he could descend to 7,000 feet. About 10 minutes later, the pilot reported he was at 8,000 feet and requested radar vectors for the instrument landing system approach to runway 2 at the McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport, at Jackson. The pilot told the controller he had the left engine shut down. About 5 minutes later, the pilot reported he had a propeller runaway. About 1 minute later, the pilot reported he was in visual conditions and requested radar vectors direct to the airport. About 2 minutes later, the pilot reported he had a cloud layer under him and that he had the localizer frequency for runway 2 set. About 1 minute later, the pilot was told to contact the McKellar Airport control tower. The pilot acknowledged this instruction. No further transmissions were received from the flight. Examination of the left engine at the accident site showed the left propeller control was found disconnected at the point the propeller control extension bracket attaches to the propeller governor. The propeller control cable had also pulled loose from a swaged point at the control rod and was also separated further aft due to overstress. The housing for the propeller control rod was found securely attached to the engine and the control rod was securely attached to the extension bracket. The propeller governor control arm, which was disconnected from the propeller control cable and rod, was found spring loaded into the high RPM position. Examination of the fractured left propeller bracket assembly was performed by the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, D.C. The bracket assembly was fractured in the area of the outermost eyehole, at the point a bolt passes through the bracket assembly and the propeller governor arm. The fracture surface contained small amounts of dirt, grease, and minor corrosion. The fracture surface features include flat areas that lie on multiple planes separated by ratchet marks, features typically left behind by the propagation of a fatigue crack. The fatigue crack emanated from multiple origins on opposite sides of the bracket. The total area of the fatigue crack occupied approximately 85 percent of the fracture surfaces. The fatigue fractures initiated on the outer edges of the surface and propagated inward toward the center. The remaining 15% of the fracture surface had features consistent with overstress separation. Near the middle of each fatigue region were micro-fussures suggesting that the crack propagated under high-stress conditions. The NTSB Materials Laboratory also examined the separation point between the left propeller control flexible cable and the rigid rod that connects to the bracket assembly. The cable and the swaged part of the rigid rod were in good condition with no fractures or damage. The Piper PA-31-T2 Pilot Operating Handbook, Section 3, Emergency Procedures, does not contain a procedure for loss of propeller control. Section 3 did contain a procedure for \"Over speeding Propeller\", which stated that if a propellers speed should exceed 1,976 rpm, to place the power lever of the engine with the over speeding propeller to idle, feather the propeller, place the engine condition lever in the stop position, and complete the engine shutdown procedures. Pilot logbook records show the pilot completed a simulator training course for the accident model airplane about 9 days before the accident and had about 13 flight hours in the Piper PA-31-T2.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's shutting down the left engine following loss of control of the left propeller resulting in an in-flight loss of control of the airplane due to the windmilling propeller. Factors in the accident were the failure of the propeller control bracket assembly due to fatigue, the pilot's lack of experience in the type of airplane (turbo propeller) and the absence of a procedure for loss of propeller control in the airplane's flight manual."

The Aircraft Accident Report number is NTSB/AAR-14/02. On August 14, 2013, about 0447 central daylight time (CDT), United Parcel Service (UPS) flight 1354, an Airbus A300-600, N155UP, crashed short of runway 18 during a localizer nonprecision approach to runway 18 at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport (BHM), Birmingham, Alabama. The captain and first officer were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and postcrash fire. The nonscheduled cargo flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 on an instrument flight rules flight plan, and dark night visual flight rules conditions prevailed at the airport; variable instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) with a variable ceiling were present north of the airport on the approach course at the time of the accident. The flight originated from Louisville International Airport-Standiford Field (SDF), Louisville, Kentucky, about 0503 eastern daylight time (EDT).",
            "probable_cause": "the flight crew's continuation of an unstabilized approach and their failure to monitor the aircraft's altitude during the approach, which led to an inadvertent descent below the minimum approach altitude and subsequently into terrain. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crew's failure to properly configure and verify the flight management computer for the profile approach; (2) the captain's failure to communicate his intentions to the first officer once it became apparent the vertical profile was not captured; (3) the flight crew's expectation that they would break out of the clouds at 1,000 feet above ground level due to incomplete weather information; (4) the first officer's failure to make the required minimums callouts;  (5) the captain's performance deficiencies likely due to factors including, but not limited to, fatigue, distraction, or confusion, consistent with performance deficiencies exhibited during training; and (6) the first officer's fatigue due to acute sleep loss resulting from her ineffective off-duty time management and circadian factors."

An examination of the nose gear revealed that the rear actuator bolt had failed and that the engine mount was bent near the nose gear actuator attach feet.  Previous nose gear failures and runway excursions resulted in the redesign of the original engine mount due to compliance (flexibility) in the engine mount actuator attach feet structure.

The pilot attempted to maintain directional control; however, the airplane continued to veer to the left and departed the runway. Examination of the airplane revealed that the nose landing gear had collapsed, and the engine mount was fractured at one of the two attachment feet for the nose landing gear actuator. Metallurgical examination of the fractured attachment foot revealed that it had failed as a result of fatigue cracking that initiated at the intersection of two welds that joined two of the engine mount\u2019s support tubes to the right attachment foot. The fatigue cracking progressed along the toe of the weld that joined the forward support tube to the attachment foot. The location of the fatigue fracture was consistent with bending loads caused by a force directed aft by the nose gear actuator. About 9 years prior to the accident, the airframe manufacturer issued a service bulletin requiring an inspection of the engine mount attachment feet at the first regularly scheduled maintenance event after the engine mount reached 290 hours time-in-service and thereafter every 100 hours. If cracks were observed, a new engine mount must be installed. The service bulletin also states that, despite the replacement of the engine mount, the inspections should continue. As part of the inspection procedure, the paint is removed from and around the attachment feet. After the inspection is complete, the area is covered with a corrosion prevention compound. The airframe manufacturer considers performance of the service bulletin mandatory. On April 8, 2010, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued Safety Recommendation A-10-44, which asked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require repetitive inspections of the engine mount feet. On December 22, 2011, based on the FAA\u2019s response that the safety risk is not sufficient to warrant issuance of an airworthiness directive to require the repetitive inspections, the NTSB classified the recommendation Closed-Unacceptable Action.Review of the airframe maintenance records indicated the airplane\u2019s total time at its most recent inspection was about 2,238 hours, and no entries were found indicating replacement of the engine mount or compliance with the manufacturer\u2019s issued service bulletin. Additionally, paint was observed on and around the attachment feet, which indicates that the inspection had never been performed. ",
            "probable_cause": "Fatigue failure of an engine mount attachment foot, which resulted in collapse of the nose landing gear during landing. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the owner/operator to adhere to the manufacturer's suggested engine mount inspection schedule."

They flew to a practice area to the west of Opa Locka West Airport and performed basic instrument work. The right front seat passenger was acting as the safety pilot. While they were returning to Opa Locka Airport, while in cruise flight at 1,500 feet, the engine ceased operating abruptly. Attempts to restart the engine were unsuccessful and the airplane was ditched in the Everglades, about 2 miles west of the Opa Locka West Airport. Prior to the forced landing they made contact with a controller at the FAA Opa Locka Airport Control Tower. They were rescued by a Miami-Dade County Police Department helicopter and taken back to the Opa Locka Airport. Post accident examination of the airplane and engine after the airplane was recovered from the Everglades showed the engine rotated when the propeller was rotated, but it was determined the accessory section of the engine was not rotating. Disassembly of the engine showed the crankshaft had fractured in the aft cheek of the No. 2 main bearing. The remains of the main bearing were found in the bottom of the engine crankcase. Metallurgical examination of the forward end of the crankshaft revealed that the fracture was located in the aft cheek of the No. 2 main bearing journal. The fracture surface showed features typical of fatigue progression from the radius of the journal in a plane perpendicular to the radius surface (approximately 45 degrees to the journal surface) with multiple origins. The mating fracture surface was completely damaged by rubbing. The fatigue initiation site at the radius surface did not contain scoring marks or scratches, but circumferential skidding marks and rub damage that intersected the origin area were observed elsewhere in the radius. Skidding/rub damage was also observed on the journal surface, with the surface being heat-tinted and rougher than the other main bearing journal surfaces. Examination of the No. 2 main bearing pieces showed that the pieces appeared to make one complete set of bearings. Sections of the bearings were rounded and showed a copper-colored region toward the edge (the copper-colored region is the middle layer in the tri-metal bearings used). The bearing contour matched the crankshaft radius. One bearing piece showed that the anti-rotation tab was fractured off in overstress. Examination of the crankcase halves showed that the No. 2 main bearing bosses revealed severe rotational rub damage, consistent with rotation of the bearing against the boss. Some minor wearing/fretting damage was observed on the boss mating surface of main bearing No. 3. Examination of the cylinder mounting surfaces in the vicinity of the locations where through-bolts at the No. 2 main bearing emerge from the case did not reveal significant fretting/corrosion damage. Only minor localized areas of fretting/corrosion damage were observed. Engine logbook records show that the engine last received a major overhaul on April 1, 1997, 865.5 flight hours before the accident. On November 25, 1998, 557.5 flight hours before the accident, all six cylinders were replaced with new cylinders. On August 23, 2001, 298 flight hours before the accident, all six cylinders were replaced with overhauled cylinders.

The new owner performed a detailed preflight inspection and repetitive run up checks prior to departure, with no mechanical anomalies noted. After takeoff, the pilot climbed to about 600 feet above the ground, flew straight for approximately 2 miles, then turned to the left. During the turn, the pilot noted a low frequency vibration, and an \"unusual back pressure on the cyclic.\" Coming out of the turn, back pressure to the cyclic increased. Indicated airspeed was 75 mph, and all gauges were \"in the green.\" As the helicopter continued straight and level, back pressure continued to increase, requiring more forward cyclic to maintain airspeed and level flight. The pilot climbed, and turned back toward the departure point. After the turn, the helicopter initiated an uncommanded nose up attitude and rolled to the left, with the nose then dropping so low that the pilot was looking at the ground. The pilot arrested the turn utilizing collective and throttle, and by \"forcibly\" pulling and pushing on the cyclic as needed. He then performed a \"quasi-controllable\" autorotation to the ground, landing on the skids, heading down-slope on a hill, with no forward or side motion. The helicopter subsequently rolled over on its right side, and fuel ignited as the pilot exited through the broken windshield. Due to the helicopter being consumed in the postcrash fire, a thorough examination was not possible.",

He attempted to correct the imbalance by placing the left fuel selector in the crossfeed position so that both engines would receive fuel from the right main fuel tank. About 15 minutes after the pilot selected the crossfeed position, both engines lost power. When the pilot reset the left and right fuel selectors to the left main and the right auxiliary fuel tanks, respectively, the left engine regained power and the right engine began \"surging.\"  The pilot decided not to shut down the right engine and diverted to the nearest suitable airport. During final approach, the right engine lost power completely, and the airspeed decayed until it approached the airplane\u2019s minimum control airspeed. When the airplane drifted right of the runway centerline, the pilot reduced power on the left engine in an attempt to maintain control. The airplane impacted an open field near the runway and a postimpact fire ensued. Postaccident examination revealed no airframe or engine anomalies consistent with a preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction. Both fuel selectors were positioned to their respective main fuel tanks. The pilot stated that the airplane was fully fueled before departure. The airplane fuel system was composed of two 37-gallon main fuel tanks and two 31-gallon auxiliary fuel tanks. The pilot stated that he had not used any of the fuel in the auxiliary tanks before the loss of engine power. The pilot's operating handbook noted that the crossfeed system was not to be used to transfer fuel from one tank to another or to balance fuel during flight. The simultaneous loss of engine power while both engines were receiving fuel from one fuel tank, the restoration of power on the left engine after switching fuel tanks, operation at or near the fuel endurance limit for the right main fuel tank, and the lack of anomalies identified during the engine exams are consistent with exhaustion of fuel in the right main tank.",

After takeoff, while climbing out at 120 - 130 knots and climbing 500 feet per minute, the airplane was near 4,000 feet msl when he felt the controls of the airplane get heavy.

As the airplane descended toward the destination airport, the crew moved the landing gear handle to the extend position.  The pilots noted a \"gear disagree\" warning message displayed on the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) that showed the main landing gear were down and locked, and the nose gear was not fully extended.  The pilots opted to land at an alternate airport and began to troubleshoot the gear indication with use of the airplane's Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).  Despite their efforts, which included using the manual release handle, the nose gear failed to extend.  The airplane touched down on the main landing gear and the nose lowered to the ground as the speed dissipated.  Review of the CVR found that the flight crew followed each step of the Quick Reference Handbook checklist.  The flight crew did not cycle the landing gear lever, nor was that action part of the QRH procedure at the time.  The digital flight data recorder (DFDR) revealed that the main landing gear transitioned into the down and locked position but the nose gear remained partially extended between the uplocked and downlocked positions.  A further review of the data disclosed the hydraulic pressure remained constant throughout the extension and did not show the pressure changes that should have occurred with normal system operation.  The only pressure changes noted in the duration of the flight were consistent with the manual release system being activated.  No increase of brake pressure was recorded during the gear extension attempt, indicating that there was no hydraulic backpressure on the retract side of the NLG actuator.  The components of the nose landing gear (NLG) system were tested, revealing no anomalies or malfunctions that could have precluded normal operation.  Several simulations were conducted exploring various potential problem scenarios; however, none of the simulations produced the hydraulic system and brake pressure readings on the accident flight's DFDR data.  A review of several maintenance discrepancy databases for events where the NLG failed to extend into the downlock position found that the operator did not have a higher event rate of gear disagree messages than the rest of the worldwide fleet.  Simulations and static analysis on the friction force of the uplock was performed, specifically detailing the interaction between the pin and the latch.  As a result of the testing, areas of potential problems with the NLG extension systems (both normal and manual) under adverse conditions were found to include: friction within the system and the sequencing of the hydraulic pressure application.  Bombardier subsequently modified the QRH procedure, adding another step to specifically recycle the gear selector handle.",

The friend assisted the pilot before departure and watched as the airplane departed. He did not notice any anomalies with the airplane during the takeoff or the climbout. According to a witness in the vicinity of the accident site, he heard the airplane coming toward him, and it was flying very low. He looked up and saw the airplane approximately 200 feet over his house and descending toward the trees. As he watched the airplane, he noticed that the right propeller was not turning, and the right engine was not running. He stated that the left engine sounded as if it was running at full power. The airplane pitched up to avoid a power line and rolled to the right, descending below the tree line. A plume of smoke and an explosion followed.Examination of the right propeller assembly revealed evidence of significant frontal impact. The blades were bent but did not have indications of rotational scoring; thus they likely were not rotating at impact. One preload plate impact mark indicated that the blades were at an approximate 23-degree angle; blades that are feathered are about 86 degrees. Due to fire and impact damage of the right engine and related system components, the reason for the loss of power could not be determined. An examination of the airframe and left engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.A review of the airplane maintenance logbooks revealed that the annual inspection was 12 days overdue. According to Lycoming Service Instruction No. 1009AS, the recommended time between engine overhaul is 1,200 hours or 12 years, whichever occurs first. A review of the right engine maintenance logbook revealed that the engine had accumulated 1,435 hours since major overhaul and that neither engine had been overhauled within the preceding 12 years. Although the propeller manufacturer recommends that the propeller be feathered before the engine rpm drops below 1,000 rpm, a review of the latest revision of the pilot operating handbook (POH) revealed that the feathering procedure for engine failure did not specify this. It is likely that the pilot did not feather the right propeller before the engine reached the critical 1,000 rpm, which prevented the propeller from engaging in the feathered position. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain airplane control following loss of power in the right engine for reasons that could not be determined because of fire and impact damage. Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s delayed feathering of the right propeller following the loss of engine power and the lack of specific emergency procedures in the pilot operating handbook indicating the need to feather the propellers before engine rpm falls below 1,000 rpm."

During the approach the pilot aligned the gondola to scrape along the top of a tree line adjacent to the intended landing field. He stated that, in ballooning, it is a common practice to scrape against the tops of trees on approach. The pilot allowed the balloon to descend too low during the maneuver and the balloon's \"red line\" became tangled in the trees which caused the envelope to deflate. The balloon then caught fire and the gondola settled to the ground as the pilot turned off the fuel. Both he and the passenger egressed the gondola safely before fire consumed the gondola.",

During the first phone call he received an outlook briefing and he received a weather briefing and filed an instrument flight rules flight plan during the second phone call.  The flight departed at 1429 eastern standard time, and after takeoff air traffic control (ATC) communications were transferred to several different facilities as the flight progressed towards the destination airport.  At 1709:40, the pilot established contact with the Memphis Air Traffic Control Tower (Memphis ATCT) and advised that the flight was at 4,000 feet.  The pilot was questioned as to what type of approach he would like at the destination airport and he replied global positioning system (GPS) runway 16.  The controller advised the pilot there was no weather reporting facility at the destination airport.  The flight remained in contact with the Memphis ATCT for the remainder of the flight, and was cleared to descend and maintain 3,000 feet, which the pilot acknowledged.  The flight continued and the pilot advised the controller at 1724:49, that the flight was at 2,300 feet though no descent clearance from the previously assigned 3,000 had been given.  The pilot was then asked what type of approach he wanted; he again advised GPS 16.  The flight was vectored for the approach, advised of the weather conditions at the nearby Memphis International Airport, and cleared to descend to 2,000 feet.  The flight continued, and the pilot was advised that the flight was 5 miles from the initial approach fix (IAF), vectored heading 180 degrees, and cleared for the GPS 16 approach.  The pilot then responded that in the event of a missed approach, he would go to Memphis, to which the controller provided missed approach instructions, which the pilot acknowledged.  Review of a plot of radar targets indicate that from that time, the airplane flew in a southerly direction, and intercepted the final approach course between the initial approach fix (IAF) and the final approach fix (FAF).  The airplane flew west of the final approach course, then turned to the left flying in a southeasterly direction, and re-intercepted the final approach course approximately 3.5 nautical miles south of the FAF, which was between the FAF and the missed approach point (MAP).  The airplane then flew east of the final approach course, turned to the right flying in a southwesterly direction, and re-intercepted the final approach course near the MAP.  The airplane flew west of the final approach course, then turned to the right towards the northwest, followed by a left turn to the west.  The last recorded radar return occurred at 1743:09, indicating 900 feet, and was located at 35 degrees 12.5028 minutes North latitude and 090 degrees 04.1076 minutes West longitude, or .58 nautical mile southwest of the MAP, which is over the Mississippi River.  The airplane, pilot and passenger have not been located and are presumed to be destroyed and fatally injured, respectively.  Cowling plugs marked with the airplane's registration were found south of Helena, Arkansas, 2 days after the accident.  The pilot had completed the FAA Wings level VIII in June 2002.  A METAR weather observation taken at the Memphis International Airport (KMEM) at 1753 (approximately 10 minutes after the accident) indicates the wind was from 150 degrees at 5 knots, the visibility was 6 statute miles in mist, broken clouds existed at 700 feet, and overcast clouds existed at 2,100 feet.  The temperature and dew point were 48 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively, and the altimeter setting was 30.08 inHg.  The remarks section of the METAR indicates rain ended at 1702.  The KMEM airport is located approximately 10 nautical miles south-southeast of the General Dewitt Spain Airport.  Sunset occurred in the area at 1706, and the end of civil twilight occurred at 1732.  Doppler weather radar depicted no significant severe weather echoes over the area between 1700 and 1800.",
            "probable_cause": "The cause of the accident is unknown as the airplane has not been located.  A finding in the investigation was the fact that the pilot conducted an unstabilized approach; the flight was right, left, then right of the final approach course during the approach and the radar data reflects the pilot was correcting back to the final approach course during the entire approach."

The airplane entered a right descending spiral until impacting terrain 2 miles west of the airport.  In accordance with the instrument departure procedure, the pilot had taken off from runway 19, elevation 125 feet msl, under a 600-foot overcast sky condition.  Thereafter, the pilot commenced a right climbing turn.  The pilot reported climbing through 1,100 feet and 1,600 feet msl, and the radar controller informed the pilot that he was not receiving the airplane's mode C transponder signal.  The radar controller then observed one radar hit and then lost contact with the airplane.  All recorded radar data from the area around the airport at the time of the accident was reviewed.  The FAA indicated that  this location had only one long-range radar site that covered the area below 5,000 feet.  When the recorded radar data was filtered to search for targets within a 10 nm radius around the airport and up to 5,000 feet, the subject airplane was only observed one time on a transponder code of 3311.  The target had an invalid Mode C code at that time, with no radar reinforcement.  The approximate distance and bearing from the end of runway 19 to this first radar hit, was 2.3 nm and 261 degrees, magnetic.  The approximate distance and bearing from the radar hit to the crash site was 0.6 nm and 042 degrees, magnetic.  Based upon a subsequent examination of the radar data showing all targets, three additional non Mode C transponder (primary) targets were located.  The positions of these targets were noted southwest of the airport, at the following times:  0929:22, 0929:58, and 0930:22.  The calculated ground speed between these hits and the previously identified Mode C target was, respectively, 75, 131, and 163 knots.  During the subsequent airframe and engine examination, no evidence of any mechanical failure or malfunction was found.  However, neither the artificial horizon nor the directional gyroscope were recovered from the 50-foot deep pond.  During the wreckage examination, the airframe was found accordioned in an aft direction, and the wings were fragmented.  Evidence was found that could document the pilot's instrument flying currency and familiarity with the make and model airplane.",

About six miles north of the destination, the pilot obtained an airport advisory.  The weather conditions at the destination airport were one mile visibility in light snow and mist, and a ceiling of 1,000 feet broken.  The pilot requested a Special VFR clearance.  As the in-flight visibility decreased to 1 mile, the pilot said he decided to begin a right turn back to an area of better visibility.  During the turn, he said he entered white-out conditions.  He leveled the wings of the airplane, and applied engine power to begin a climb.  The airplane then collided with snow covered terrain, about 850 feet msl.  The location of the accident is about 1 mile north of the Class E airspace. ",

At 600 feet and 80 knots the pilot under instruction (PUI) entered the practice autorotation after the certified flight instructor (CFI) rolled the collective twist grip to idle to simulate an engine failure.  The PUI executed the practice autorotation towards the runway.  During the recovery sequence the PUI inadvertently and unknowingly engaged the manual fuel control slide lock on his collective as he adjusted the collective for a power recovery, allowing the CFI to twist the collective grip past the \"VOL\" (fly) position.  The engine and rotor RPM oversped due to excessive fuel flow to the engine, which resulted in a catastrophic failure of the turbine section.  The airport tower notified the crew that the helicopter was on fire.  The crew made a force landing on the runway, egressed, and fire crews arrived to extinguish the fire.  The collective twist grip has two normal operating positions.  The \"MIN\" position sets the engine at idle, while turning the grip counter clockwise to the \"VOL\" (flight) position stop accelerates the engine to a flight rpm setting.  At the \"VOL\" position the DECU (Digital Engine Control Unit) controls the engine power to maintain rpm as the pilot moves the collective.  A slide lock device prevents the twist grip from moving beyond the \"VOL\" position.  The manual fuel control slide lock is only on the right pilot seat collective.  The twist grip can be moved beyond the \"VOL\" position by moving a slide lock lever on the collective twist grip forward and rotating the twist grip beyond the \"VOL\" position.  Once the twist grip is out of the \"VOL\" detent position the pilot input has priority over the DECU and the pilot is manually metering fuel to the engine; this could allow the pilot to increase the amount of fuel delivered to the engine beyond what the DECU is delivering.  The slide lock is spring loaded to its retracted locked position unless moved forward, usually by the pilots thumb, approximately 5 mm.  At this point it is then \"latched\" open allowing the twist grip to be rotated beyond the \"VOL\" position.   Post accident examination and testing of the engine fuel control unit and the manual slide lock mechanism found no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures.  The helicopter manufacturer is aware of four prior inadvertent manual throttle activations that resulted in engine overspeed conditions and damage to both the engines and airframe structures.  The manufacturer has discontinued installing the twist grip mechanical flight stop device and replaced it with an electrical solenoid type of configuration on all production AS350-B3 helicopters.  This new configuration is also available to current owners and operators as a hardware modification.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot under instruction's inadvertent activation of the collective manual fuel slide lock, which led to engine and main rotor overspeeds due to excessive fuel flow during power application.  This resulted in failures of the gas generator turbine (N1) blades, power turbine (N2) blades, and created an external engine fire.  A factor in the accident was the manufacturer's inadequate design of the twist grip slide lock, which had insufficient safeguards to preclude inadvertent activation."

The vibration was followed by a right yaw that the pilot could not correct with a pedal input. As the pilot attempted to maintain level flight, he heard a \"metallic clunking\" behind him. He looked back and saw what he described as the tail rotor losing rotor speed. The pilot maintained forward flight by countering the right yaw with left cyclic input while he located a cul-de-sac in a residential neighborhood in which to land. The pilot entered an autorotation, and during the descent, the helicopter impacted the roof of a house and an adjacent brick wall. Witnesses reported that the helicopter didn't \u201csound right,\u201d that the engine was sputtering, and that the engine power appeared to be increasing and decreasing. The helicopter was observed rocking and teetering before nose-diving toward the ground. After the helicopter impacted the ground, the engine continued to run, and the tail rotor continued to spin. A postaccident investigation revealed that the main transmission pinion had fractured and separated through the threads that retained the aft pinion nut. Because the aft pinion nut maintained the position of the splined sleeve that drove the tail rotor drive shaft, the separation of the pinion allowed the sleeve to wobble as it turned and to move aft, partially disengaging its external splines from the internal splines in the tail rotor drive shaft. The sleeve\u2019s splines began to grind against the drive shaft\u2019s splines, and the resulting material loss on the splines reduced the engagement between the parts to the point where a loss of tail rotor drive occurred. It is likely that enough residual contact between the damaged splines remained to keep the tail rotor spinning (as observed after impact) but was not sufficient to deliver power to the tail rotor.Examination of the pinion fracture surfaces determined that the pinion failure was due to a fatigue crack that initiated in a thread root and propagated through about 75 percent of the pinion\u2019s cross-section before the remaining material succumbed to overstress conditions. No indication of material deficiencies, such as inclusions, voids, or pits, were found at the crack initiation site. According to the helicopter\u2019s maintenance records, the pinion had been in service for 1,584.4 hours, and on the day before the accident, a 100-hour inspection had been performed in accordance with the helicopter manufacturer\u2019s instructions. These instructions included a procedure for checking the torque of the aft pinion nut, and a co-owner of the helicopter reported that he observed the mechanic perform the torque check.  It is likely that the fatigue crack was not large enough to be detected during the inspection and then propagated to the point of failure during the accident flight. ",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.After takeoff from runway 28, at an altitude of 600 feet msl, the pilot initiated a right turn.  During the turn, the engine began to \"run rough,\" and the engine rpm decreased to between 1,800 - 2,000 rpm.  The flight instructor told the pilot to return to the airport, and the pilot set up the airplane for a downwind landing on runway 10.  When the airplane was halfway down the runway, the pilots decided to perform a go-around.  They applied full power, and initiated a \"slight\" climbing right turn above trees at the departure end of runway 28, and then a left turn to return for landing on runway 28.  During the turn, the aircraft \"entered an accelerated stall,\" and the left main landing gear impacted the ground.  The airplane continued across a grass area and struck a group of trees.  Examination of the engine revealed the number 3 cylinder contained a crack from the spark plug hole to a point between the cylinder intake and exhaust valve.  The most recent annual inspection was performed 2 months prior to the accident, during which no abnormalities were noted with the cylinders.  At the time of the accident, the wind was from 250 degrees at 7 knots.  The airport consisted of two runways; runway 10/28, which was 6,002 feet long by 150 feet wide, and runway 14/32 which was 5,057 feet long by 150 feet wide.",
            "probable_cause": "The flight instructor's improper in-flight decision to perform a emergency landing to a runway, with a tailwind, and his failure to maintain airspeed after aborting that landing, which resulted in an inadvertent stall and subsequent impact with terrain.  Factors in the accident were the partial loss of engine power due to a cracked cylinder, and tailwind condition."

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators may not have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The private pilot and his passenger departed on a flight to an airport with an elevation of 5,157 feet mean sea level (msl), and a density altitude of about 6,200 feet. Although the pilot had received classroom instruction on high elevation airport, high density altitude operations, the flight was his first to a high elevation airport, and he planned to conduct his first landing there as a touch-and-go. After touchdown, the pilot retracted the flaps, applied full throttle, and lifted off. The pilot perceived that the airplane was underperforming on the climbout, and he enriched the fuel-air mixture, which did not rectify the problem. The engine was making \"popping\" sounds, the airspeed was lower than normal, and the tachometer indicated about 500 rpm less than the target value. The pilot began a right turn back toward the airport, and lowered the airplane\u2019s nose to increase airspeed, but the airplane entered a spin and impacted terrain. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.Review of the pilot's history revealed that he received all his training and flight experience through a flight school that was based at an airport with an elevation of about 1,500 feet msl. The pilot's full enrichment of the mixture for the takeoff and climbout at the destination airport was contrary to the procedure published in the airplane manufacturer's Pilot's Operating Handbook, which stated that the mixture was to be leaned for maximum rpm. Considering the dynamic conditions and limited time available to ensure proper mixture adjustment during a touch-and-go landing at a high-elevation airport, and the effect of an improper mixture on airplane climb capability at such an airport, the pilot deprived himself of potential safety margins by deciding to conduct his arrival as a touch and go. His lack of any prior operations at high elevation airports further reduced his safety margin by depriving him of applicable experience. Subsequent to the accident, the pilot\u2019s flight school implemented several new policies regarding operations at high elevation airports, including a prohibition against pilots operating solo at such airports until they have done so with a flight instructor.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's decision to conduct a touch-and-go arrival during his first flight to a high elevation airport, which resulted in an improper mixture adjustment and a partial loss of engine power for the takeoff and attempted climbout."

The flight departed and after reportedly lowering the landing gear selector handle, the landing gear down and locked lights did not illuminate.  The pilot cycled the navigation light switch, flew by the tower and was advised the gear appeared down and locked.  He retracted the gear, reentered the traffic pattern, and again lowered the gear handle, but again, there were no down and locked lights from the landing gears nor a gear unsafe light.  The pilot landed the airplane and reportedly after touchdown, the left main landing gear began to collapse.  The airplane veered off the left side of the runway into grass and came to rest with the left and nose landing gears down and locked; the right main landing gear was collapsed.  Post accident testing of the left main landing gear revealed no evidence of failure or malfunction; the down and locked light illuminated.  The hydraulic pump was removed, bench tested, and found to operate normally.  Testing of hydraulic fluid revealed it was contaminated beyond allowable limits.  There was no requirement by the airplane manufacturer to replace the hydraulic fluid.  The pilot reported that he did not utilize the emergency gear extension. ",
