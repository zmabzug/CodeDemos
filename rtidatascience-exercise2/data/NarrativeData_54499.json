Shortly after departure, the aircraft struck the side of a nearby mountain. There were no indications of loss of control or of any preimpact anomalies with the airframe or engine. The pilot had a long history of rheumatoid arthritis and back pain, and was on multiple medications, including two different narcotic painkillers.  He had reported to the FAA a history of arthritis and the use of medication typically prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis, and the FAA had not requested any further information. The pilot had experienced increased pain within a month of the accident, and post-accident toxicology testing indicated the presence of a third narcotic painkiller and a short-acting local anesthetic in his system at the time of the accident, suggesting the possibility of additional treatment for his pain within a few days of the accident. Toxicology testing was also consistent with the ingestion of at least 10 tablets of a prescription narcotic painkiller within the 2 hours prior to the accident.  The circumstances of the accident, in which this experienced pilot flew directly into clearly visible elevated terrain with no discovered anomalies with the airplane, could suggest an unknown cockpit distraction, impairment, or an intentional act; however, the investigation could not conclusively determine the specific cause of the accident.",

A city police department operated the helicopter for law enforcement patrol missions.  After exiting an orbit around a ground situation, the crew saw the low rotor rpm warning light flash on, then back off, then on again.  Normal rotor and engine rpm was shown on the tach.  They were only 3 miles from their airport base and the pilot decided to return there.  The low rotor warning light began to flash on and off, with an increasing frequency until it was steady.  Suddenly all the cockpit warning and caution lights illuminated, both on the eyebrow panel and center pedestal panel.  The hydraulic system also turned off and the pilot had to resort to manual force on the flight controls.  The pilot checked the engine and rotor gages and noted that the rotor needle was pointing off scale high; however, neither crewmember heard any change in the engine and rotor sounds.  The observer reported that he believed they lost their radios and exterior lights at this time and also said that the engine and rotor tach needles were married together at 100 percent until the autorotation.  The pilot was on an extended final approach to the runway and helicopter control was becoming difficult.  Suddenly, an airplane appeared on base leg to the runway and the pilot had to maneuver to avoid a collision.  With the control difficulties and uncertainty about what was happening to the helicopter, the pilot decided to autorotate to a clear area in a schoolyard.  The night sun spotlight failed during the autorotation and the pilot cleared a building but could not avoid a parked trailer that he had not seen before.  The helicopter collided with the trailer, then the ground, and rolled over.  The hydraulic system solenoid valve is electrically operated and it takes electrical power to close the valve and turn off the hydraulics; the valve fails to the open position when electrical power is lost.  Post accident testing of the hydraulic system found normal operation.  The complete electrical system wiring was traced from the generator and battery to the ground points on each circuit, with no discrepancies found.  The main rotor tach drive and the cockpit gauge were functionally tested.  No like events were found during searches of the historical records for the US Army, Bell Helicopters, or in the FAA SDR database.  Bell Helicopter opined that an almost complete electrical system voltage spike/surge simultaneously in a large number of circuits would be required to replicate the event as described by the crew. ",

The flight instructor assumed control of the airplane and unsuccessfully attempted to restart the engine while descending for an emergency landing. He ditched the airplane into a nearby bay. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the windshield during the accident sequence and was submerged in salt water. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the bolt or lockplate, which attaches the crankshaft gear to the aft end of the crankshaft, was missing. Further, the alignment dowel was fractured across about one-third of the cross-sectional area. The bolt and lockplate were likely either not installed or were improperly installed, which would allow the bolt to loosen and become disengaged. Measurements of the dowel, pilot flange, and counterbore recess diameters were all within the manufacturer's specifications; the dowel also met the manufacturer's hardness requirement. Because the components were within manufacturer's specifications, it is likely that the components did not have any preexisting wear or manufacturing issues. Additionally, wear marks on the crankshaft, dowel, and gear were likely caused by the newly installed gear and were consistent with either no installation or improper installation of the bolt or lockplate. Therefore, it is likely that when the wear on the dowel had proceeded through about one-third of the cross-section, the stresses in the dowel became sufficiently high to initiate fatigue cracks at the base of the worn part of the dowel and eventually led to a fatigue fracture. The evidence is consistent with the failure of maintenance personnel to install, or properly install, the bolt and lockplate during the engine\u2019s last overhaul, which resulted in the crankshaft gear becoming separated from the crankshaft and a total loss of engine power. If the engine had failed at a point that would have allowed the pilot to land the airplane on land, the airplane damage is less likely to have been substantial; therefore, contributing to the accident was the lack of suitable terrain.",

One Air Tractor, N6037H was taking off to the east; the second one, N7318K, was landing to the west.  The pilot of the first Air Tractor reported that on the day of the accident, there were 8 agricultural airplanes operating from the airport.  The weather was good with a light wind from the southeast.  Slight early morning haze was present; there was no fog.  The east/west oriented runway does not have a parallel taxiway but there is a taxiway that runs north/south which intersects the runway.  While taxiing north on the taxiway towards the runway before takeoff, he looked for approaching traffic from the east and west; he did not see any.  He taxied onto the runway towards the approach end of runway 9 for his third flight than day.  He began his takeoff roll and only observed the other airplane 3-4 seconds before the collision.  The two airplanes collided and and there was immediate fire.  He exited the right side of his airplane and within seconds, could not get to the other airplane as it was engulfed in flames.  He reported the airplanes exploded 2 more times as he left the area.  He did not report using the business radio; he was not injured.  The owner of Glades Ag Services, Inc., verbally reported that the pilot of the second Air Tractor had completed his second aerial application flight of the day and had landed on runway 27, the landing was closer to the approach end of runway 27.  A witness who was holding short of the runway in his airplane reported looking  to the west and observed a Glades Ag Services, Inc., airplane accelerate to takeoff.  He then looked to the east and observed an airplane which had already landed, taxiing on the runway.  He observed the collision and immediately heard an explosion.  A METAR weather observation taken at the Palm Beach International Airport on the day of the accident at 0753 (8 minutes after the accident) reported the wind was from 130 degrees at 10 knots, the visibility was 10 statute miles, few clouds existed at 2,400 feet, scattered clouds existed at 12,000 feet, a broken ceiling existed at 25,000 feet, the temperature and dew point were 25 and 21 degrees Celsius, respectively, and the altimeter setting was 30.09 inHg.

Examination of the airframe and engine revealed that the nose landing gear hydraulic actuator hose was separated from its corresponding B-nut coupler. The B-nut fitting remained attached to the threaded end of the hydraulic actuator; however, the hose was separated from the coupler at the coupler flange. The hose was covered by dark soot and extensive thermal damage was noted. The opposing end of the hydraulic hose was secured to its associated coupler and fitting.

The engine did not respond and the pilot realized that the airplane would not be able to make it to the closest airport. He elected to perform a forced landing on a road. An automobile pulled out on the road and the pilot had to extend the airplane's glide. The airplane collided with mangrove trees and came to rest off the side of the road.A postaccident examination of the airframe, flight controls, and engine assembly revealed no evidence of a mechanical malfunction. The airplane was configured with one magneto installed on the left side of the engine and an experimental electronic ignition system installed on the right side. An electronic module was installed on the magneto pad and connected to two high-tension spark coils mounted on top of the engine, which fired the upper spark plugs. There were two wires from the module to each coil supplying the trigger voltage signal to fire the spark plugs. One of the wires to the right coil, firing cylinder Nos. 1 and 3, was not connected.A wiring harness connected the module to the airframe electrical system and the spark coils. The harness was connected to the module with a \"D\" plug, which was held in place with two screws. The plug was found disconnected from the module and hanging loose. This likely resulted in the complete loss of power to the right ignition system, causing a partial loss of engine power as reported by the pilot.Review of the airplane logbooks revealed the airplane had flown 25.7 hours since the last condition inspection. The airframe and powerplant mechanic who performed that inspection stated that he did not check the \"D\" plug during that condition inspection.",

The 10,000-hour commercial rated helicopter pilot, reported that the helicopter \"cleared\" the platform deck and entered translational lift  when \"it lurched violently to the left and started a rapid descent.\"  The pilot then lowered the collective and dropped the nose to avoid striking the platform.  He recalled hearing a \"screaming or screeching type of sound\" as the helicopter descended, and was not able to maintain main rotor RPM.  The helicopter landed into the water, and rolled to the right.  After the occupants evacuated, the helicopter submerged 30 feet under the surface.  The skid mounted float system was not activated, although the pilot stated that the floats were \"armed\" and that he attempted to deploy the floats while in the autorotation, via the float activation button that was mounted on the collective.  The float activation button was located within a circular ring that was mounted on the pilot's collective.  Download of the Incident Recorder (IR) of the ECU showed that the IR was first triggered by a droop in rotor RPM, followed by a MGT exceedence, power surge, engine flameout, and Ng underspeed in a span of 3.38 seconds.  Download of the MGT instrument  showed a recorded peak temperature of 953 degrees for 1 second.  Teardown examination of the engine revealed a catastrophic failure of the power turbine assembly.  Metallurgical examinations by the NTSB and Rolls Royce revealed evidence that the 3rd stage turbine wheel airfoil(s) had failed.  A root cause of the failure was not determined, and further testing was conducted at Rolls Royce.  As a result of some of the dynamic test results, Rolls Royce issued several Commercial Engine Bulletins (CEBs) regarding inspection of in-service turbine assemblies.  Additionally, Bell Helicopter issued an Alert Service Bulletin (ASB), which introduced flight manual revisions to avoid power turbine RPM (Np) steady state operation between 68% and 97%.

The pilot reduced airspeed in an attempt to stop the elevator from fluttering, but the elevator continued to flutter. As a result of the flutter, the control column was moving rapidly forward and aft about 6 inches, which would correspond to an elevator up and down movement of about 20 degrees. The pilot decided to make an emergency landing in a cow pasture because he was worried about a structural failure. Upon touchdown on the cow pasture, the nosewheel dropped into a hole, and the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted. Postaccident examination revealed that the fuselage was substantially damaged, and the trim push wire that actuated the elevator trim tab was fractured. Examination of the trim push wire revealed that it had been secured to the trim tab by a wire swivel/screw stop that was attached to the trim horn. Further examination revealed that the trim push wire was bent and had fractured just forward of the wire swivel/screw stop. The fracture face displayed corrosion and striations consistent with fatigue. Examination of the trim horn on which the wire swivel/screw stop was mounted also revealed wear, scratching, and gouging. The observed damage was consistent with the wire swivel/screw stop binding during operation and being unable to rotate under load.Airplane manufacturer personnel indicated that they observed a similar failure when spectators at an airshow leaned against a trim tab on an airplane that was on display, bending the trim push wire, which subsequently failed in flight.",

I noted that it was not very high off the ground.  I saw its red and green lights but its headlight or landing light was not visible.  ... A few seconds later, I heard what sounded like a crash or an explosion and the lights went out in the house.\"  Another witness stated that \"there was a flash of light and he looked out to see a fire in front of his house and in the street.  He said that there were tiny fires through out the area and the fires went out quickly.  He said it was a cloudy night and very dark.  ...  He said the airplane noise was coming from a different direction then he usually hears.\"  The pilot stated that he \"saw one side of runway lights on the way in and did not notice runway lights on takeoff.\"  An on-scene investigation found no anomalies.  Continuity was established to the flight controls. Engine control continuity was established.  The engine produced a thumb compression at all cylinders.  The left magneto produced spark at all leads.  Fuel was found in the fuel selector valve.  The propeller blades exhibited chordwise abrasions.  A power line was found with a missing section.

After taxiing to the north end of the airstrip and noticing a strong right-quartering gusty headwind, the pilot selected 20 degrees of flaps and applied full power.  The takeoff roll was normal, with the first 1,000 feet being on level ground, the second 1,000 feet being uphill, and the last 300 feet being on level ground; a fence bordered the end of the airstrip.  The pilot, anticipating a longer-than-usual ground roll consistent with the uphill departure, applied back pressure on the control yoke with 300 feet of available runway remaining, but the aircraft did not lift off the ground.  He then added another 10 degrees of flaps, which he said was in accordance with the airplane's soft-field takeoff procedures.  At about the same time the airplane was crossing the fence line at the end of the runway, the pilot heard the sound of an impact.  After the airplane became airborne the engine immediately developed a vibration, prompting the pilot to make a right 180 degree turn back to the airstrip.  Approximately one-half to two-thirds of the way through the turn the engine lost all power and quit.

            "narrative": "On November 29, 2013, at 1824 Alaska standard time, a Cessna 208B Caravan airplane, N12373, sustained substantial damage after impacting  terrain about 1 mile southeast of the St. Mary's Airport, St. Mary's, Alaska. The airplane was being operated as flight 1453, by Hageland Aviation Services, Inc., dba Era Alaska, Anchorage, Alaska as a visual flight rules (VFR) scheduled commuter flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135. Of the 10 people on board, the commercial pilot and three passengers sustained fatal injuries, and six passengers sustained serious injuries. Night, instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the St. Mary's airport at the time of the accident and company flight following procedures were in effect. Flight 1453 departed from the Bethel Airport, Bethel, Alaska, at 1741 destined for Mountain Village, Alaska, and continuing to St. Mary's. Prior to reaching Mountain Village, the flight diverted to St. Mary's due to deteriorating weather.Witnesses on the ground at St. Mary's reported seeing the airplane fly over the airport at low altitude, traveling in a southeasterly direction. They continued to watch the airplane travel away from the airport, until its rotating beacon disappeared. Being concerned about the direction and altitude the airplane was flying, the witnesses attempted to contact the pilot on the radio, with no response. They then heard another aircraft on the radio report that there was an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) going off in the vicinity of St. Mary's. After checking for the airplane's last reported position on the company's flight following software, a search was initiated. Approximately one hour after the search was initiated, the airplane was located and rescue personnel confirmed that the pilot and two passengers died at the scene. One passenger died after being transported to the local clinic. The six surviving passengers were evacuated to Anchorage for treatment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), along with an inspector from the Anchorage Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) traveled to the accident scene, but continuous poor weather conditions prevented them from reaching the site until December 1. The main wreckage was in an open area of snow-covered tundra, at an elevation of approximately 425 feet mean sea level (msl). The top of the ridge where the airplane impacted is at an approximate elevation of 530 feet msl. From the initial point of impact, the airplane traveled approximately 200 feet before coming to rest in an upright position. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and wings. An on-scene documentation of the wreckage was completed, and a detailed wreckage examination is pending, following recovery of the airplane.The accident airplane was not equipped, nor was it required to be equipped with, a cockpit voice recorder (CVR), or a flight data recorder (FDR).The nearest official reporting station is the St. Mary's Airport (PASM). About 8 minutes before the accident, at 1816, an Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) was reporting: Wind, 230 degrees (True) at 7 knots; visibility, 3 statute miles; sky condition, overcast at 300 feet above ground level (agl); temperature, 18 degrees F; dew point, -32 degrees F; altimeter, 30.01 inches Hg. At 1836, the METAR was reporting, in part: Wind, 240 degrees (True) at 6 knots; visibility, 2.5 statute miles; sky condition, overcast at 300 feet agl; temperature, 18 degrees F; dew point, -32 degrees F; altimeter, 30.01 inches Hg.",

During a forced landing to a grass strip, the pilot turned the controls over to his more experienced pilot-rated passenger to perform the landing. As the airplane slowed for landing, the automatic landing gear extension system deployed the landing gear. The airplane subsequently landed short of the runway and the right wing struck a post. The fuselage was twisted and both wings were bent/wrinkled as a result. A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the crankcase was cracked and the bottom of the fuselage was covered with oil. The oil was traced to originate from a fitting that attached the propeller governor high-pressure oil line from the nose of the crankcase to the propeller governor.

The pilot stated that shortly after takeoff, the engine \"abruptly and smoothly rolled back.\"  Movement of the power control lever had no effect.  He stated that use of the manual override (MOR) system did not restore engine power.  He secured the engine and executed a forced landing on a roadway.  The airplane's wing struck two utility poles during rollout.  Data downloaded from the accident aircraft indicated that the recorded engine interstage turbine temperature (ITT) exceeded published limits during the event.  The post accident engine inspection revealed turbine damage consistent with an over-temperature event.  The inspection also revealed a leak in the compressor discharge pressure (CDP) sensor bellows within the fuel control unit (FCU).  The leak prevented the bellows assembly from responding to throttle inputs and resulted in the FCU providing minimum fuel flow to the engine regardless of the throttle setting.  Following this accident an improved FCU design which incorporated a more robust bellows design was released and retrofited into the entire in-service and production fleet.  The airframe manufacturer issued a revision to the pilot's operating handbook to provide an improved procedure for use in the event of an in-flight engine power loss.  It also updated information regarding the Manual Override (MOR) system.",
            "probable_cause": "Failure of the fuel control unit (FCU) bellows which resulted in a significant loss of engine power and the pilot's encounter with unsuitable terrain during the subsequent forced landing.  A contributing factor was the pilot's inadvertent exceedence of the engine temperature limitations during use of the manual override (MOR) system.  Additional factors were the roadway and the utility poles struck during the forced landing."

At 1409:08 the controller cleared the flight to descend and maintain 15,000 feet, and at 1409:17 the pilot read back the clearance in its entirety.  At 1410:20 the controller instructed the pilot to expedite his descent through 16,000 feet for traffic; however, there was no response.  From 1410:33 to 1417:21 the controller made ten attempts to contact the pilot; again, there was no response.  At 1417:26 the controller requested the pilot to ident if he could still hear him.  At 1417:38 the controller received an ident from the aircraft and instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 15,000 feet.  At 1418:36 the controller cleared the aircraft for the GPS approach and to acknowledge with an ident.  There was no response.  The aircraft had impacted a rocky drainage trench near the base of rock outcropping on a magnetic heading of 200 degrees in a wings level, approximately 40-degree nose down attitude, 15 nautical miles east-southeast of the destination airport at an elevation of 5,630 feet mean sea level.  An examination of the aircraft's flight control, pressurization, and electrical systems revealed no anomalies with these systems which would have precluded normal operations.  A further examination of the thermal damage to the aircraft, determined that there was no evidence of an inflight fire.  Both engines underwent a complete teardown examination revealing no evidence of catastrophic or preaccident failure, and that both engines were functioning at the time of impact.  Radar data revealed the aircraft was in level flight at FL 190 for more than 4 minutes, when it had previously been cleared to 15,000 feet.  It subsequently began a climb reaching an altitude of 20,300 feet before beginning a right descending turn followed by a left descending turn.  The last radar return before radar contact was lost indicated the aircraft was at 15,900 feet and descending.  No evidence was available that suggests icing greater than light rime icing was present in the area and that weather was unlikely to have been a factor in the accident.  The pilot was on two medications for high blood pressure and one for high cholesterol.  The pilot had recently been found to have an elevated blood sugar, suggesting early diabetes or some other systemic disease or injury.  The pilot had a family history of heart disease and high blood pressure, and had at least one episode of chest tightness in the past.  It is possible that he had some unrecognized heart disease.  The circumstances of the accident suggest substantial impairment or incapacitation of the pilot. It is possible that the pilot experienced an event such as a stroke or heart attack related to his previous medical conditions or as a new occurrence.

The flight's departure was delayed 2 hours due to heavy rain showers and a thunderstorm.  The planned flight route was to follow a highway through a river valley with high terrain (peaks above 8,000 feet) on both sides until reaching a point where the highway diverged from the river.  At that point, the flight was to leave the highway and follow the river.  Analysis of available weather data indicated that as the airplane proceeded along the river valley, ridge tops on both sides of the valley became obscured.  Bases of the overcast were probably about 7,000 feet msl.  Ragged clouds and mist were probably present beneath the overcast due to recent rain showers in the area.  Slant visibility was likely diminished.  Local pilots reported that in these type weather conditions the numerous drainages that feed into the river valley can be similar in appearance.  The pilot made a position call about 15 minutes after takeoff stating that he was over a small town located close to the point where the flight was to leave the highway.  This was the last radio communication received from the airplane.  Analysis of radar data available for the first 8 minutes of the flight indicated the airplane was not at the position reported by the pilot, but was actually well short of this position.  About 15 minutes later, witnesses heard and saw the airplane flying up a drainage located short of the reported position.  This drainage ended in a box canyon.  Inspection of the accident site indicated that the airplane was in a left climbing turn when it impacted steep terrain near the head of the drainage at an elevation of about 6,600 feet.  The airplane nosed over, came to rest inverted, and a fire erupted.  Three of the occupants exited the burning wreckage.  All communications equipment, survival equipment and foul-weather gear aboard the airplane were destroyed in the fire.  One of the three initial survivors died from his injuries the following morning.  At that time, the remaining two survivors decided to depart the site for lower elevation due to extreme cold and precipitation.  Searchers found the wreckage later that afternoon.  The two survivors walked out to the highway 2 days after the accident.  No abnormalities were noted during examination of the airplane that would have prevented normal operation.  When the pilot took a check ride that allowed him to act as pilot in command of public use flights carrying passengers into the back-country, he reported to the check pilot that he had 100 hours flight time in \"typical terrain (over mountains).\"  USFS standards required 200 hours flight time in typical terrain.  However, the standards did not define typical terrain.  Examination of the pilot's logbook revealed that it did not include a specific record of back country or mountain flying experience.  Review of the past 2 years of logbook entries revealed a total of only 15 entries (14 hours flight time) that included a takeoff or landing at a back-country airport.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's misidentification of the airplane's location, which resulted in his improper decision to fly into the wrong drainage, and his failure to maintain terrain clearance while executing a turn to reverse course after he realized his navigational error.  Contributing factors were the low visibility due to mist, obscuration of the mountainous terrain, and the pilot's lack of experience in back country flying."

The helicopter continued to descend and contacted the runway hard, which resulted in substantial damage to the vertical firewall. A postaccident engine run revealed no evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation.

The pilot was unable to glide the airplane to the airport, and it subsequently impacted trees and the ground in a residential area about 3 miles from the airport. The pilot had completely fueled the airplane before departure, and adequate fuel remained onboard at the time of the engine power loss. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the three-position fuel selector handle was positioned in between the left and right tank detents, which would have restricted fuel flow to the engine. A subsequent test run of the engine was performed successfully, and no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures was found that would have precluded normal engine operation. The airplane\u2019s before landing checklist instructed the pilot to move the fuel selector valve to the fuller fuel tank for landing. It is likely that, while on approach and preparing the airplane to land, the pilot switched fuel tanks and then inadvertently failed to ensure that the fuel selector handle was fully positioned in the detent of the fuel tank he intended to select. \u000b\u000bDuring the impact sequence, the pilot\u2019s shoulder harness separated, and his cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma to the torso. The autopsy also reported a near-complete transection of the thoracic aorta. If the pilot\u2019s shoulder harness had remained intact, the risk of traumatic transection of the aorta would have been significantly reduced and, thus, the pilot likely would only have incurred serious, not fatal, injuries. \u000b\u000bExamination of the shoulder harness revealed that the belt had separated about 31 inches from where the fastener connected to the lapbelt. The location of the separation corresponded approximately to where the belt would pass through the D-ring behind the pilot\u2019s shoulder. The belt separation area exhibited about 0.25-inch fraying on one edge and 1.25-inch fraying on the other edge along a total area of about 7.75 inches. The shoulder harness manufacturer\u2019s component maintenance manual states that the acceptable limit for webbing fraying was a 6-inch area. Microscopic examination of the separated fibers revealed that they had separated in overload. The airplane\u2019s maintenance manual and a Federal Aviation Administration advisory circular contained information pertaining to the inspection of shoulder harnesses during 100-hour or annual inspections. The accident airplane\u2019s most recent annual inspection was completed about 1 month before the accident. \u000b\u000bAlthough the pilot\u2019s toxicology report was positive for pain medication, the medication was not detected in his blood; thus, it is likely that the pilot took the medication many hours before the accident flight and was not impaired during the flight. \u000b",

About 10 minutes later, he reported that the engine was running roughly and that there was smoke in the cockpit. He then stated that he was shutting down the engine. The pilot then made a forced landing in rough terrain. An examination of the wreckage site revealed black viscous fluid on the belly of the fuselage from the engine compartment to the tail skid. The ground underneath the fuselage was also stained with black fluid.Postaccident examination of the engine determined that several of the connecting rod journals and the No. 2 connecting rod had overheated and that the No. 2 connecting rod had fractured and separated. A nonstandard shim was found installed between the propeller hub and the crankshaft propeller flange. A review of the maintenance logbooks found no documentation or entries indicating when the nonstandard shim was manufactured or installed nor who made it.
