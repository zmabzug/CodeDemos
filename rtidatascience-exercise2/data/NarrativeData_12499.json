            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.A staff pilot for the manufacturer was providing a sales demonstration flight to a potential customer's pilot when yaw control of the helicopter was lost, it entered a spin, collided with the ground, and rolled over.  During the flight the customer's typical aerial application pest control flight profile was to be flown.  The customer pilot flew Bell 206's currently in the mission and had no experience in the NOTAR anti-torque system.  The maneuver was a simulated aerial application pass followed by a turn around.  The manufacturer's pilot said the maneuver was very docile and consisted of a pass down a creek bed at 60 knots and 50 feet.  The customer pilot initiated a gentle cyclic pull-up to a 10- to 15-degree nose up attitude while entering a right turn as the helicopter decelerated.  At the 90 degree point in the turn, the helicopter was at 40 to 50 knots with a 30-degree or less bank angle to the right.  As the nose came around in the turn, the nose tucked down to about 20 degrees below the horizon.  The manufacturer's pilot took over the controls and added near full aft cyclic to level the nose; at this point, he received a low rotor warning horn (indicating a rotor droop at 95 percent or lower).  Coincident with the low rotor warning, the helicopter began a right yaw rate.  He added full left pedal, but the yaw rate continued at what he described as a \"slow pedal turn rate,\" eventually completing 4 to 6 complete revolutions.  At this point the helicopter began descending and he added collective.  He immediately got a \"power\" audio warning, indicating that he was exceeding the upper power limit of the engine.  The right yaw rate also increased with collective input.  The pilot then modulated the collective between the low rotor warning and the excessive power warning in an attempt to both control the yaw and stop the descent.  As he lowered the collective and the rotor speed began to build, the yaw would slow, but the helicopter then began descending faster.  As he added collective to slow the descent, the yaw rate would increase.  As the helicopter neared the ground, the yaw finally stopped; however, the helicopter was translating sideways toward a berm.  The helicopter touched down on the right skid against the berm and it rolled over.  The manufacturer's pilot said his hands were following on the controls as the customer pilot flew and he did not perceive any unusual control inputs.  He further stated that his feet were about 1 inch from the anti-torque pedals and he did not feel any inputs from the customer pilot on the pedals.  Based on his extensive flight test experience in this helicopter, the manufacturer's pilot believes that the aft cyclic input to correct the nose down pitching moment induced a rotor droop, and that the droop was the initiating event in the yaw rate onset.  He does not know how low the rotor speed went, but the warning is triggered at 95 percent Nr.  The lower limit of the Nr green arc is at 90 percent.  The NOTAR anti-torque control system uses air from a pedal controlled jet thruster nozzle on the end of the tail boom to provide anti-torque control.  Additional yaw control is provided by vertical stabilizers, which are largely effective only above 20 to 30 knots.  Air is supplied to the thruster by a fan driven by a power takeoff shaft from the main transmission.  There is a direct relationship between the speed of the main rotor and the speed of the fan.  The pilot said he believes that the initial yaw onset was because the rotor drooped low enough to slow the fan below the speed which could supply the necessary air volume to the thruster to control the yaw and they were not fast enough for the vertical stabilizers to have any effect.  After the occupants had extricated themselves from the wreckage, the customer pilot asked the pilot what had happened.  He replied to them that he didn't know what happened and added, \"Maybe we should have turned to the left instead.\"  The helicopter's FAA approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) contains several warnings about low speed maneuvering.  Under the heading \"Unanticipated Right Yaw\", the RFM section notes that an unanticipated right yaw can occur when operating at low altitude and airspeeds below 60 knots when a pilot's attention is distracted by events outside the helicopter and sufficient control inputs are not made to adjust for changing aerodynamic conditions.  The paragraph states, \"If no directional or cyclic control inputs are made, a nose down pitch and a right roll may follow the right yaw.\"  The section notes that this is most likely to occur at speeds below 60 knots in uncoordinated right turns, while flying out of trim with too much right pedal, or right turns to a downwind condition.  Examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of a preimpact malfunction or failure of the control system.",
            "probable_cause": "the manufacturer's pilot's failure to maintain yaw control and main rotor speed while recovering from an unusual attitude induced by the customer pilot's inadequate control inputs while maneuvering at low altitude.  The manufacturer's pilot's inadequate supervision of the flight is also causal.  A factor in the accident was the customer pilot's lack a familiarity with the NOTAR yaw control system."

The gunnery range included an east-west track, approximately 1 mile long, with four targets just to the north of the track and three targets just to the south of it. Each target was to be engaged as it came into range, with gunfire coming from both sides of the helicopter. After engaging all of the targets along the track, the helicopter was to reverse course and commence another firing run. A total of eight tracks were flown prior to the accident: four in each direction. All of the eastbound tracks were flown by the copilot, seated in the left seat, and all the westbound tracks were flown by the pilot in command (PIC), seated in the right seat. After the completion of each track, the pilots transferred control of the helicopter and the new pilot at the controls executed the course reversal.After the copilot had completed the final eastbound track, he transferred the controls to the PIC. The PIC then began a left-turn course reversal approximately 100 feet above the ground. The next thing the PIC remembered was that, while in the turn and \u201clike a hazy dream,\u201d he saw the copilot\u2019s finger moving toward the instrument panel and, after that, \u201cbeing dragged, shaken, and bumped along the ground.\u201d The PIC stated that despite his hazy recollection, he remembered that the helicopter was operating properly, with no warnings, cautions, or changes in sound. He further noted that even though the copilot appeared to be pointing at something, the copilot did not speak or otherwise indicate that anything was wrong. There was no indication of hostile fire.Observations at the accident site revealed that the helicopter was traveling westward at terrain impact. The initial impact point, at the eastern edge of a dried-up pond, was 17 meters in width, indicated by imprints of both skids. About 1 meter east  feathered dirt indicated a spinning tail rotor. The second point of impact was on the western edge of the same dried-up pond. The distance between the first point of impact and the main wreckage was about 44 meters. The tail boom came to rest about 20 meters to the south, and about 24 meters east of that was the tail rotor.After the wreckage was secured, it was shipped to the United States where examination revealed that the helicopter had impacted the ground in a descending left turn. Main rotor blade damage indicated flailing at impact, at operational rpm. Tail rotor blade damage also indicated that the rotor was under power at impact. Flight control continuity could not be confirmed from the cockpit to the flight control surfaces; however, continuity was confirmed at the tail rotor pitch change mechanism. The engine did not exhibit any preimpact mechanical anomalies, and interior compressor blade scoring on the engine shroud indicated that it was operating at impact.The ENGINE OUT warning light was illuminated at some point during impact sequence; however, an expected RE-IGN P RST caution light was not concurrently illuminated for unknown reasons. It is possible that the ENGINE OUT warning light illuminated as the helicopter was decelerating while in ground contact.

One witness stated that the airplane went off the left side of the runway before becoming airborne, and, once aloft, it headed toward a row of trees on the east side of the airport. The airplane climbed over the trees, turned to the south, and then quickly rolled right and descended to the ground. A postcrash fire consumed most the airplane. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot\u2019s logbook noted about 4 hours in the accident airplane, and, according to his logbook entries, he had not flown since June 12, 2010, after receiving instruction in the airplane, thus he did not meet the FAA\u2019s recent experience requirement for the required number of takeoff and landings to carry passengers.The airplane\u2019s estimated gross weight at the time of the accident was about 243 pounds over its approved maximum takeoff weight.Given the witness accounts of the airplane swerving off the runway during the takeoff roll, and of its subsequent nose-high attitude and rapid roll prior to impact, it is likely that the pilot lost control during the takeoff roll and then applied excessive nose-up pitch to become airborne. Once airborne, he failed to attain sufficient airspeed to avoid an aerodynamic stall, and the airplane descended out of control to the ground.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's loss of control of the airplane during takeoff, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's lack of experience in make and model, his lack of currency in FAA required takeoffs and landings, and his excessive loading of the airplane."

About 11 minutes after takeoff, the airplane entered a 1,000 foot-per-minute descent. The airplane continued to descend at this rate until it impacted terrain at an elevation of 4,734 feet. Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane was still on its northeasterly course towards the destination at impact.

The ensuing takeoff was normal through liftoff and gear retraction; however, during initial climb the left engine experienced compressor stalling and lost power.  As the crewmembers were executing the engine failure checklist, the right engine first increased power in Automatic Power Reserve (APR) and then began to similarly stall and lose power.  After about 20 seconds the engines recovered sufficient power to enable the flight crew to remain airborne and return for landing on the departure runway.  Review of the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) output and internal examination of each engine revealed that the engines had compressor stalled due to accumulated dirt and contaminants on the compressors.  A review of the right engine DFDR data revealed that, while the left engine was stalling, the flight crew had retarded the right engine power lever past the 64-degree power lever angle position which tripped off the CTOT system.  The resulting transient in fuel flow, in company with an atmospheric temperature inversion, reduced the stall margin of the right engine. ",

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.Witnesses reported that the airplane\u2019s takeoff ground roll appeared to be normal. Shortly after the airplane lifted off, it stopped climbing and yawed to the left. Several witnesses heard abnormal sounds, which they attributed to propeller blade angle changes. The airplane\u2019s flight path deteriorated to a left skid and its airspeed began to slow. The airplane\u2019s left bank angle increased to between 45 and 90 degrees, and its nose dropped to a nearly vertical attitude. Just before impact, the airplane\u2019s bank angle and pitch began to flatten out. The airplane had turned left about 100 degrees when it impacted the ground about 1,500 feet from the midpoint of the 10,000-foot runway. A fire then erupted, which consumed the fuselage.Review of a security camera video of the takeoff revealed that the airplane was near the midpoint of the runway, about 140 feet above the ground, and at a groundspeed of about 130 knots when it began to yaw left. The left yaw coincided with the appearance, behind the airplane, of a dark grayish area that appeared to be smoke. A witness, who was an aviation mechanic with extensive experience working on airplanes of the same make and model as the accident airplane, reported hearing two loud \u201cpops\u201d about the time the smoke appeared, which he believed were generated by one of the engines intermittently relighting and extinguishing.Postaccident examination of the airframe, the engines, and the propellers did not identify any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Both engines and propellers sustained nearly symmetrical damage, indicating that the two engines were operating at similar low- to mid-range power settings at impact. The airplane\u2019s fuel system was comprised of two separate fuel systems (one for each engine) that consisted of multiple wing fuel tanks feeding into a nacelle tank and then to the engine. The left and right nacelle tanks were breached during the impact sequence and no fuel was found in either tank. Samples taken from the fuel truck, which supplied the airplane's fuel, tested negative for contamination. However, a fuels research engineer with the United States Air Force Fuels Engineering Research Laboratory stated that water contamination can result from condensation in the air cavity above a partially full fuel tank. Both diurnal temperature variations and the atmospheric pressure variations experienced with normal flight cycles can contribute to this type of condensation. He stated that the simplest preventive action is to drain the airplane\u2019s fuel tank sumps before every flight. There were six fuel drains on each wing that the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook (POH) for the airplane dictated should be drained before every flight. The investigation revealed that the pilot\u2019s previous employer, where he had acquired most of his King Air 200 flight experience, did not have its pilots drain the fuel tank sumps before every flight. Instead, maintenance personnel drained the sumps at some unknown interval. No witnesses were identified who observed the pilot conduct the preflight inspection of the airplane before the accident flight, and it could not be determined whether the pilot had drained the airplane\u2019s fuel tank sumps. He had been the only pilot of the airplane for its previous 40 flights. Because the airplane was not on a Part 135 certificate or a continuous maintenance program, it is unlikely that a mechanic was routinely draining the airplane's fuel sumps. The witness observations, video evidence, and the postaccident examination indicated that the left engine experienced a momentary power interruption during the takeoff initial climb, which was consistent with a power interruption resulting from water contamination of the left engine's fuel supply. It is likely that, during the takeoff rotation and initial climb, water present in the bottom of the left nacelle tank was drawn into the left engine. When the water flowed through the engine's fuel nozzles into the burner can, it momentarily extinguished the engine\u2019s fire. The engine then stopped producing power, and its propeller changed pitch, resulting in the propeller noises heard by witnesses. Subsequently, a mixture of water and fuel reached the nozzles and the engine intermittently relighted and extinguished, which produced the grayish smoke observed in the video and the \u201cpop\u201d noises heard by the mechanic witness. Finally, uncontaminated fuel flow was reestablished, and the engine resumed normal operation.About 5 months before the accident, the pilot successfully completed a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 pilot-in-command check flight in a King Air 90. However, no documentation was found indicating that he had ever received training in a full-motion King Air simulator. Although simulator training was not required, if the pilot had received this type of training, it is likely that he would have been better prepared to maintain directional control in response to the left yaw from asymmetrical power. Given that the airplane\u2019s airspeed was more than 40 knots above the minimum control speed of 86 knots when the left yaw began, the pilot should have been able to maintain directional control during the momentary power interruption. Although the airplane\u2019s estimated weight at the time of the accident was about 650 pounds over the maximum allowable gross takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds, the investigation determined that the additional weight would not have precluded the pilot from maintaining directional control of the airplane.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during a momentary interruption of power from the left engine during the initial takeoff climb. Contributing to the accident was the power interruption due to water contamination of the fuel, which was likely not drained from the fuel tanks by the pilot during preflight inspection as required in the POH."

On the day of the accident, the pilot first performed taxi tests and then began taking off, climbing to about 10 feet above the ground, reducing power and landing back on the runway. The pilot completed a few of these runs and then taxied back onto the runway for another run. He advanced the throttle and noted that the tachometer only went to 4,000 rpm. The airplane lifted off the runway and climbed to about 150 feet above the ground. The pilot said it would not \"climb higher or speed up.\" The airspeed was reading about 45 to 50 knots. The pilot started looking for a place to land and seeing obstacles ahead and to the left, he executed a shallow right turn back towards the airfield. The airplane stalled without notice and the pilot was not able to recover prior to ground impact. The airplane came to rest in a nose down position in a flat grassy field. The engine was displaced rearward, and the forward portion of the fuselage was crushed and compressed aft. The pilot reported that he had accumulated 240.7 hours total flight time of which 0 hours were in the accident make and model airplane. Following the accident, the propeller was found to be in \"high pitch preventing the engine from turning up to more than 4,000 rpm, limiting the horsepower.\"",

He said he was holding about 15 to 20 degrees of left crab to remain aligned with the runway centerline, and he felt a strong crosswind over the runway threshold. During the landing flare, the left wingtip fuel tank contacted the runway. The captain applied full right aileron and full right rudder, and the airplane touched down on the centerline.

The handbook says to avoid raising the nose too rapidly or steeply, as it may be difficult or impossible for the pilot to recover from the steep pitch attitude if the towline breaks or the launch mechanism loses power.

On the mishap landing, the student instructor started his flare at normal approach speed about 2 to 3 feet above the runway.  As the airplane settled, the chief pilot raised the nose of the airplane slightly to prevent a bounced landing.  The airplane subsequently ballooned.  They elected to perform a go-around.  The chief pilot advanced the power and \"pitched the airplane to the landing attitude.\"  The airplane settled to the runway in a slight left crab, touching down on the left main landing gear, which subsequently broke aft.  The airplane came down on the runway and slid for 300 feet, departing the left side and flipping over onto its back.  The airplane had been recently purchased by the company.  Total airframe time was approximately 25 hours.  An examination of the airplane showed the left main lower landing gear tube had fractured due to overstress at the landing gear wheel and brake attachment fitting.  The overstress appeared consistent with a hard landing impact as a small compression buckle was observed at the top of the part and some tensile indications were seen at the bottom.  There were also contact impressions on the inside of the tube most-likely made by the end of the main landing gear spring bar.  The wheel and brake attachment fitting was identified as a steel with designation St37, according to the German DIN classification for steels.  The St37 steel is specified to have a yield strength of at least 34 ksi (235 MPa) and tensile strength between 51 ksi and 70 ksi (350 MPa to 480 MPa).  According to the ASM Metals Handbook, St37 is similar to SAE 1013 steel, which is a low-carbon steel.  Hardness measurements on the fitting averaged 63.5 Rockwell B, with a standard deviation of 2 Rockwell B.  For steel, a hardness of 65 Rockwell B corresponds to a tensile strength of 56 ksi, so the fitting appears to be within specification.  This steel is at the lower end of the range of strength possible for steel.  The ASM Metals Handbook indicates that fatigue resistance would also improve with increasing tensile strength.  Information from the manufacturer indicates that the gear assembly was designed in accordance with ASTM F 2245, and successfully passed a drop test of 550 mm (21.7 inches) at a weight of 600 kg (1323 pounds).**This narrative was modified on August 13, 2007.**",

The data showed that the radar target then began to climb, with intermittent descents of 100 to 200 feet. The last recorded radar return indicated an airplane altitude of 2,600 feet msl. Postaccident analysis of the airplane\u2019s position information showed that last 10 seconds of recorded data exhibited a steadily increasing rate of descent; the last 2 seconds of data recorded a 5,000-foot-per-minute rate of descent that increased to a 15,000 foot-per-minute rate of descent. The airplane\u2019s roll rate during the last 10 seconds of recorded data varied from a 24-degree roll to the right to a 28-degree roll to the left. Additionally, the recorded flight data showed that the airplane\u2019s ground speed reached about 140 knots then it decreased to about 20 knots during the last 2 seconds of the flight. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A review of weather information and witness statements revealed that conditions at the time of the accident would have likely produced restricted visibility. It is likely that the presence of restricted visibility conditions and the airplane\u2019s abrupt turns just before the accident would have been conducive to the development of spatial disorientation. Therefore, the airplane\u2019s ensuing rapid descent and steep bank angle likely resulted from the pilot losing control of the airplane due to spatial disorientation.\u00a0 ",

About 20 miles from the thunderstorm activity, the airplane began to encounter moderate turbulence and severe icing conditions. The pilot deviated to the south; however, the turbulence increased, and the airplane entered an uncommanded left roll and dive. The autopilot disengaged, and the pilot's attitude indicator dropped. The pilot leveled the airplane at an altitude of 8,000 feet and landed without further incident. Subsequent examination revealed that one-third of the outboard left elevator separated in flight and that the empennage was substantially damaged. Meteorological and radar data revealed the airplane entered an area of rapidly intensifying convective activity, which developed along the airplane's flight path, and likely encountered convectively-induced turbulence with a high probability of significant icing. The effect of icing conditions on the initiation of the upset could not be determined; however, airframe structural icing adversely affects an airplane's performance and can result in a loss of control.",

About 1 hour before the flight, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a center weather advisory (CWA) that warned of moderate-to-severe turbulence. There were no records that the pilot obtained a formal weather briefing. According to the pilot's husband, the pilot typically obtained preflight weather information from \"aviationweather.gov,\" but the website does not retain records of user access. A friend of the pilot reported that the pilot was aware that \"a storm was coming\" into southern California on the day she was leaving, but the friend was unaware of the pilot's specific pre-flight activities or preparations. The investigation was unable to determine whether or how the pilot obtained weather information regarding her planned flight.  About 5 minutes after departure on the IFR flight, a second CWA for moderate to severe turbulence for the flight track region and timeframe was issued.The flight proceeded uneventfully until an air traffic controller advised the pilot of a report of light rime icing at her altitude. The controller then broadcast an all-aircraft advisory regarding the issuance (but not content) of the second CWA and instructed pilots to contact flight service for further information. It could not be determined whether the pilot obtained any specific information regarding the CWA, but she did not request to go off frequency to contact flight service. However, she requested a higher altitude in an apparent effort to avoid the reported rime icing. About 2 minutes later, the flight was cleared to 15,000 feet, and several minutes after that, the pilot reported breaking out of the clouds at 13,300 feet. Later, an air traffic controller advised the pilot of a re-route, and she reported that she had encountered moderate turbulence at 15,000 feet. About 3 minutes after that, radar data indicated that the airplane was descending at nearly 12,000 feet per minute and, very shortly thereafter, the airplane was lost from air traffic control radio and radar contact. Several ground eyewitnesses reported observing the airplane in a spin and in a vertical trajectory toward the ground, in an area where the local ceiling was about 12,000 feet above ground level. Although the airplane was substantially damaged by postcrash fire, the evidence indicated that the airplane impacted the ground in an aerodynamic spin. The investigation was unable to determine the specific reasons for the loss of control and resulting aerodynamic spin. Postaccident examination of the engine, propeller, and airframe did not reveal any preexisting mechanical deficiencies or failures that would have precluded normal operation or continued flight. The airplane aerodynamic configuration and weight distribution were significantly modified via several supplemental type certificates (STCs) relative to the original FAA-certificated configuration. Neither the FAA nor any of the STC holders evaluated the individual or combined effects of the STC changes on the airplane's spin susceptibility, characteristics, or recovery capability. Evaluation of the mass properties of the modified airplane indicated that it would be more resistant to spin recovery than it would be as originally configured. However, the investigation was unable to determine if this played a role in the pilot\u2019s inability to recover from the aerodynamic spin. On May 24, 2012, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendations A-12-21 through -23 to the FAA to address the potential adverse effects on an airplane\u2019s performance and structure if it has multiple STCs that are not properly analyzed for compatibility.Toxicological testing by the FAA Civil Aeronautical Medical Institute detected Nortriptyline in the pilot's liver. This is a prescription antidepressant used in the treatment of major depression and for certain chronic pain conditions; it is not normally used for intermittent pain. The pilot did not report the medication during her FAA medical certification examination or on her medical certificate application; pilots taking this medication are not eligible for FAA medical certification. A warning associated with this medication stated that it may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. However, the degree to which the pilot may have been impaired from the medication could not be determined.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's decision to conduct the flight into a region of reported moderate to severe turbulence and icing conditions, followed by a loss of airplane control and an aerodynamic spin from which the pilot did not recover."
