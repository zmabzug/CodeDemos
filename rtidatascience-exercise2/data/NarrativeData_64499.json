The dune buggy was connected to a deployable, powered parachute that had a fabric wing with cells that filled with air to provide lift over obstacles such as jungle canopies. The aircraft was directionally controlled in the air by foot pedals and/or a fly-by-wire servo controlled through the dune buggy\u2019s steering wheel, which could be turned off if needed. The pilot reported that the takeoff was \u201cnormal\u201d and that he then climbed the aircraft to about 500 ft. While in level flight, the aircraft \u201call of sudden, and sharply\u201d turned right with no pilot inputs. The pilot tried turning the aircraft left, but it continued to spiral right. He thought about turning off the fly-by-wire servo but realized that the servo wasn\u2019t the problem and wanted to keep using it to help rudder pedal inputs. As the aircraft passed through 180 degrees of turn, the pilot realized it was coming down over trees. He had completely lost aircraft control but found that adding power added lift to the left side of the parachute and that reducing power reduced the lift. At one point, the parachute was parallel with the dune buggy, which is consistent with a cell blowout. The pilot stated that he believed that, at some point, the cell pressurized briefly, which straightened the aircraft and allowed it to avoid the trees before hitting the ground.

During initial climb, the engine experienced a partial power loss, followed by a total loss of power. During the emergency glide back to the airport, the airplane struck utility wires just prior to the runway. The wreckage was recovered and stored outside, unattended at the airport. Several weeks later, examination of the engine revealed no mechanical discrepancies that would have prevented normal operation. Following the examination, the engine was started and ran uninterrupted.The airplane owner stated that during engine installation, the mechanic routed the carburetor vent lines upward and tie-wrapped them at the top of each carburetor. The owner further stated that someone must have tampered with the wreckage, as the carburetor vent lines were found routed downward when the engine examination was conducted. The owner subsequently provided a blurry photograph of the engine during installation, prior to the accident, which showed the carburetor vent lines routed upward and tie-wrapped. The engine manufacturer confirmed that upward routing of the lines into an area of positive static pressure could result in fuel starvation. The mechanic stated that it did not matter if the carburetor vent lines were routed upward or downward and he could not remember which way he routed them on the accident airplane. He further stated that the installation manual did not specify if the lines should be routed upward or downward.Review of Rotax installation manual excerpts, provided by the mechanic, revealed:\"15) Carburetor...CAUTION: The float chamber venting lines (3) lines have to be routed in a ram-air and vacuum free zone or into the airbox, according to the requirements and release of BRP-Rotax...These lines must not be routed into the slipstream or down the firewall...15.1.1) Drainage piping on airbox and drip trays...WARNING...Route the lines with a continuous decline.\"A low fuel level was found in the carburetor float bowl and the mechanical fuel pump, which was consistent with a possible fuel issue that included incorrect carburetor vent hose routing as stated by the airplane owner.",

Simultaneously, the LOW ROTOR RPM, FADEC FAIL, and FADEC FAULT cockpit caution lights illuminated.  The 8,300-hour helicopter pilot attempted to regain the RPM's with no result.  The FADEC AUTO/MANUAL indicator light/button showed the engine control mode to be in the \"AUTO\" condition.  The pilot recalls that the Ng was approximately 89%.  The pilot stated that about 10 seconds elapsed from the onset of the event to cross checking the Ng.  The pilot then depressed the AUTO/MANUAL button and switched to the MANUAL mode.  He then increased the throttle above the 90% detent to try to regain rotor RPM's.  He recalled that the light displayed \"MANUAL\", and that the FADEC FAIL aural warning ceased after the button was depressed.  While descending, on three separate occasions, the pilot attempted to increase the throttle which were accompanied by three uncommanded right yaws, approximately 1-2 seconds apart.  During the third uncommanded yaw, the ENGINE OUT audio sounded and the ENGINE OUT light illuminated (these occur when Ng drops below 55%).  The pilot then entered a full autorotation, deployed the skid mounted emergency float system and landed upright on the water.  Metallurgical examination of the 1st thru 4th stage turbine wheels and 1st thru 3rd stage turbine nozzles, revealed that all associated damage was due to extreme over-temperature operation.  The manual mode schedule of the Hydro-mechanical Unit (HMU) was found within limits, and the auto mode schedule had a flow shift of +10 to +15 PPH.  Evaluation and testing of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and its sub-components revealed  a shorted condition on the ECU -15V power supply.  Disassembly of the ECU and tests of the Interface (IF) and Power (PWR) circuit boards revealed that the C321 capacitor (p/n CDR33BX104AKUR) on the IF board was found thermally distressed and was measured at .58 ohms.  The C321 is a high frequency bypass capacitor from -15V to ground.  The PWR board was also visually inspected and the CR423 diode was found thermally stressed.  According to the manufacturer, the CR423 diode provides rectification on the -15V power supply and was likely stressed as a result of the shorted  C321 capacitor.  The C321 capacitor was removed from the IF board and there was no longer a short on the -15V power supply.  The ECU was re-assembled, operated, and passed a functional acceptance test after removal of the C321 capacitor.  The shorted condition of the C321 capacitor forced the -15V power supply to a low voltage condition and a significant current draw, resulting in the rectifying diode to overheat.  According to the manufacturer, the -15V power failure of the ECU resulted in the HMU to revert to manual fuel metering.  In the manual mode, the engine would have overspeed protection, but not overtemperature protection.     ",

He and his passenger arrived at the airport approximately 0800 and requested that the airplane be fueled. The airplane was pulled from its heated hangar into heavy snowfall and fueled at 0917. As the airplane sat outside in the heavy snowfall, a measurable amount of wet slushy snow accumulated on the airplane. The Fixed Base Operator manager suggested to the pilot that the airplane be deiced, but he declined. The airplane was then pulled out to the taxiway in an effort to prevent it from becoming stuck in the snow. At 0939, approximately 22 minutes after the airplane was pulled out if its hangar, the pilot departed with a visibility of 3/4 of a mile in snow and with a 4-knot direct tailwind. The pilot then made a right turn and announced that he was heading to his first waypoint. The airplane continued into an ever tightening right turn until it impacted the ground while in an inverted position about one mile north-northwest of the runway.

Witnesses reported observing the airplane lift off about two-thirds down the 4,140-ft-long, asphalt runway and then struggle to gain altitude. The passenger reported that, after takeoff, the flight instructor told him that the engine was not \u201cmaking power.\u201d The flight instructor declared an emergency and was returning to the departure airport when the airplane stalled and impacted the ground about 1/2 mile northwest of the airport. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any discrepancies that would have precluded normal operation.Weight and balance calculations revealed that the airplane was likely at or above its maximum allowable takeoff weight during the accident flight. Further, the temperature about the time of the accident was about 94 degrees F, and the estimated density altitude at the airport was about 2,200 ft mean sea level. Based on these conditions, if the engine had been operating perfectly, its available power production would have been between about 81 and 85 percent. Therefore, it is likely that these conditions, in combination with the airplane being near or slightly above its maximum allowable weight, reduced the airplane\u2019s climb performance and that, while attempting to return to the airport, the pilot failed to maintain adequate airspeed and flew the airplane beyond its critical angle-of-attack, which led to an aerodynamic stall. The flight instructor was ejected from the airplane during the impact after the right seatbelt quick release hook separated from its fuselage anchor. Examination of the quick release hook revealed that it was bent out of the plane of the attachment and twisted. In addition, the hook closure latch was also distorted and deformed. The combined deformations of the hook and latch allowed the hook to disengage. Although it is possible that the deformation occurred during the accident impact, it is more likely that preexisting deformation was present. The airplane had been operated for about 38 hours since its most recent 100-hour/annual inspection, which was performed about 3 weeks before the accident.

The flight purpose was refresher training and the specific maneuver at the time of the accident was training in the procedure for a stuck (fixed) right pedal.  According to the flight crew, there were no mechanical discrepancies with the helicopter.  A run-on landing with the fixed right pedal was made to the 260-degree taxiway.  The wind reported at the airport about 14 minutes after the accident was 330 degrees at 6 knots.  The pilots reported that the wind was 310 degrees at 6 to 8 knots with gusts to 12 knots.  According to information provided by the flight crew, the training pilot accomplished the maneuver: aligned with the runway heading with an airspeed between 55-65 knots; the instructor pilot (IP) held right pedal to induce a 10-degree right yaw; touchdown was estimated to occur about 30-40 knots; the low rotor rpm horn was \"on\" at or near touchdown, but the rotor speed was not noted; the collective was positioned at some point above half travel; cyclic was slightly forward of neutral; shortly after touchdown both pilots felt the main rotor strike the tail boom; directional control was lost and the helicopter rotated about 220 degrees nose right before coming to rest, upright.  The manufacturer indicated that main rotor/tail boom contact from blowback of the main rotor may result from forward velocity and low/decaying main rotor rpm (advance ratio) due to a high collective position during the ground run-out phase following the 30-knot plus touchdown.  The blowback condition is exacerbated by the high angle pitch setting which causes blade stall over a large portion of the rotor disk.  A blowback condition is present in all helicopters.  It may be more pronounced in the MD600N (versus the 500N) due to greater helicopter gross weight, reduced flare/deceleration capabilities because of tail boom length and installation angle, and the increased surface of the additional main rotor blade resulting in a more rapid decay of main rotor rpm.  A caution in the helicopter's Rotorcraft Flight Manual specifies for practice autorotation landings to avoid conditions of ROTOR RPM (Nr) less than 60 percent with headwinds across the rotor greater than 30 knots during touchdown autorotations.  These conditions during touchdown and subsequent ground slide, can lead to excessive rotor blowback, reduction in blade tip to tail boom clearance, and subsequent damage to the aircraft.  Avoid these conditions by reducing collective pitch after touchdown (surface conditions permitting) and minimizing ground run.",

The flight crew could not retract the landing gear and elected to return to the departure airport and performed an uneventful overweight landing.  Examination of the tire debris revealed there was significant inter ply tearing of the tires, suggesting the tire did not fail as a result of a cap failure.  According to the operator and tire manufacturer, the failure signatures were consistent with a rapid and violent event, which can be attributed either to foreign object damage (FOD) or a low tire pressure situation.  Since the #10 tire exhibited high heat signatures, the likely sequence is that the #9 wheel tire failed first, followed by the overheating of the #10 tire and its subsequent failure.  The fact that no FOD was recovered with the tire debris and the fact that the nose tires did not sustain any damage, considering their in-line position with the center landing gear, lends more credence to the low tire pressure situation.  The airplane underwent a regularly scheduled service check, which included a tire condition and pressure check, approximately 30 hours prior to the event.  The tire pressure was not documented during the service check.  A post-incident examination revealed the #9 wheel had a leaking fuse plug.

He reported that the helicopter's searchlight was on and that fog and mist were visible at treetop level.  Postaccident inspection of the helicopter revealed no preexisting anomalies that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.  Download of the engine's electronic control unit nonvolatile memory indicated that the engine was operating at 98 percent Ng when it impacted the trees.

During the repairs, the wings were removed and reinstalled.  Prior to the pilot's purchase of the airplane, he and an inspection authorization (IA) certificated mechanic examined the airplane and the airplane's maintenance records.  During the cross-country flight back to the pilot's state of residence, he landed for an intermediate fuel stop.  After refueling, the pilot taxied to runway 34 for takeoff.  According to the airport's automated weather observing system (AWOS), the density altitude was 10,300 feet mean sea level and the wind was 4 knots from the west.  In accordance with the airplane flight manual, the pilot selected the second notch of flaps (24 degrees) for the takeoff.  During the takeoff roll, the airplane began to \"lift off (feel light) and the tail wheel left the ground, the [airplane] began turning left.\"  The pilot attempted to maneuver the airplane back to the runway centerline; however, the application of \"right rudder was ineffective.\"  The airplane's main landing gear struck a runway light and the airplane was approaching a snow fence.

Examination of the airplane revealed that the wing flap system was not rigged in accordance with the airplane's maintenance manual.  The accident airplane's \"handle full down\" flap setting was 0 degrees, and according to the manual, the \"handle full down\" flap setting was negative 7 degrees.  The flap settings were found to be misrigged by 7 degrees through the entire flap setting range.  In accordance with the airplane flight manual, the flap handle position for takeoff should be set the second notch, or 24 degrees of flaps, position.  Due to the improperly rigged flap setting, the actual flap position during the accident attempted takeoff was 31 degrees.

The end cap was examined and found to have failed in fatigue that initiated from multiple origins at an internal diameter. The fatigue had propagated significantly into the wall thickness of the end cap and through the thickness at one location. The striation count revealed that the fatigue crack had initiated and been growing in the end cap for at least 22,563 cycles. The end cap had been inspected using an ultrasonic method recommended by the manufacturer 3 cycles prior to the incident. The crack was present at the time of the inspection which indicated that the inspection method was ineffective in detecting the crack. The timing of the end cap inspection was in compliance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. The crack was also present at the time of the last overhaul. Examination of the microstructure of the material revealed that the longitudinal grain direction was oriented parallel to the shuttle valve bore in the end cap. Resistance to fatigue can be improved by aligning the principle tension stresses in the end cap with the longitudinal grain direction. It is probable that the manufacturer had determined that the grain direction was a contributing factor to fatigue failure in the end cap and revised the end cap drawing to require a grain direction along the longitudinal axis of the end cap in February 2010.

A pilot-rated witness, who was located in his airplane at a taxiway/intersection, observed the accident airplane appeared to be set up for a short field landing based on the final approach descent angle and full flap position.  Approximately 10 to 12 feet above ground level (agl), the airplane appeared to flare and then drop onto the runway.  The airplane bounced and became airborne with the wings in a straight and level position.  The airplane then drifted to the right of runway centerline, and the witness heard the \"engine power come up.\"  The airplane's nose suddenly pitched up and approximately 30 to 40 feet agl, the airplane stalled and impacted the terrain in a nose low attitude.  The instructor pilot stated that he had no recall of the accident flight or the previous several days.  Examination of the airframe showed the flaps were in the 30-degree extended position, and the elevator trim was approximately 10 degrees nose up.  No anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operations.  The pilot's operating handbook supplement for \"Balked Landing\" procedures required the retraction of flaps to 20 degrees immediately.  An elevator trim stall occurs when full power is applied to an airplane configured with excessive nose-up trim.  Positive control of the airplane is not maintained resulting in a stall.  These types of stalls usually occur during a go-around procedure from a normal landing.  During the previous four flights, the instructor pilot noted on a grade sheet that the trainee was \"below standards and needs additional training\" on areas to include approach to landing stalls, short-field landings, and judgment.  In addition, the instructor pilot noted the following comments, \"[Trainee] sometimes struggles with aircraft trim, tries to 'muscle' aircraft...Sometimes initiates flare too high, but has enough finesse for a safe landing -- except for short field landings, where he doesn't have the airspeed to sacrifice.  For short field approaches, needs to work on a stabilized approach and not flaring high.\"  The operator's program required an initial assessment to be used as a tool to help develop the individual \"Master Training Program\" which was to serve as the trainee's \"roadmap\" to gain experience, skills and knowledge necessary to complete the trainee program.

The destination airport was about 521 nautical miles away. IFR conditions prevailed along the en route portion of the flight, but visual conditions prevailed at the destination airport. The airplane's fuel capacity was 90 gallons, and the engine consumed about 16.5 gallons per hour. The airplane was in cruise flight above the clouds and the pilot requested a visual approach from the south when he was about 19 miles southeast of the destination airport. The airport does not have terminal radar coverage, and is served by a flight service station. The request for a visual approach was not approved due to mountain obscuration south of the airport. The pilot was cleared for the ILS distance measuring equipment (DME) approach. The pilot was initially uncertain of his approach options, which included a radial transition to the localizer, outbound on the localizer with a procedure turn, or a no-procedure turn at 40 DME. He eventually understood and accepted the radial transition clearance, which required him to intercept the localizer course inbound on a 35-mile DME arc. As the airplane approached the inbound localizer heading, the pilot did not make the inbound turn. Air Route Traffic Control Center and Flight Service Station (FSS) personnel made various attempts to contact the pilot to request that he execute a missed approach procedure, but there was no immediate response. The pilot eventually reported that he had descended into visual conditions, but indicated that he was not sure where he was in relation to the airport. He determined his position and began to fly toward the airport at 3,000 feet. Communication with the airplane was garbled and broken for a short while since the airplane was now about 27 miles west of the airport. FSS personnel requested assistance from other airplanes in the area to locate the accident airplane and relay radio communications. About 7 minutes before the accident, the pilot radioed that he was low on fuel and probably would not make it to the airport. He ditched the airplane about 5.4 miles west-northwest of the airport after his fuel supply was exhausted. The pilot and the sole passenger escaped the sinking airplane and were rescued by a float-equipped airplane that had responded to the FSS request for assistance. The pilot reported that he missed the inbound turn onto the localizer because his autopilot failed to capture the localizer. He also said that during the flight headwinds were greater than expected, the cloud ceiling at the destination airport was lower than expected, and the fuel vendor at the departure airport may have not completely filled the fuel tanks to their maximum capacity.

The GPS data showed the pilot turning north and then initiating a descent from 11,000 feet approximately 45 minutes after takeoff. The data tracked the aircraft through the descent and a turn to the east and then through approximately 135 degrees of right turn to ground impact. Witnesses at a temporary firefighting landing site located a half mile southwest of the crash site and equipped with a windsock and helicopter observed the aircraft fly west to east slightly north of the landing site and roughly parallel to the axis of the landing area.

During the descent, he realized that the engine had lost power, so he switched fuel tanks, applied carburetor heat for about 20 seconds, and moved the throttle in and out. Since these actions did not restore power to the engine, he looked for a place to execute a power-off forced landing. Because there was no suitable smooth terrain in the area upon which to land, he slowed the aircraft and flew it onto the forested terrain in a landing attitude.

Earlier that morning, a 20-minute flight from home base to a local airport was conducted for the purpose of flight training for the pilot's son.  Prior to the return flight, the son informed his father that during his flight the engine would balk, sputter, and cough every time he added power.  When asked by his father if he was engaging the throttle too quickly, the son replied that he did not.  The CFI was asked if he had noticed any problems with the engine.  He replied that there was nothing unusual experienced with the engine.  No discrepancies were noted during the taxi, takeoff roll, or initial climb out.  About 15 minutes into the flight the pilot noted a drop in rpm.  He made several unsuccessful attempts to troubleshoot the problem. When he applied carburetor heat, there was a further loss of rpm.  The external examination of the engine disclosed no discrepancies.  The engine was test run.  The first engine start was unsuccessful.  Ether was sprayed on the intake filter and several more attempts were made to start the engine.  The engine would start, but would only run for 10 seconds during those attempts.  The carburetor was removed and inspected.  Fuel was observed in the bowl with unrestricted movement of the floats, and the main jet appeared free of debris.  The carburetor was sent to the manufacturer for further examination.  During the bench test when fuel was initially applied, it flooded the carburetor.  When the outside of the carburetor was manually tapped the flooding stopped.  No further discrepancies were noted with the bench test.  An internal examination revealed that the float valve retractor clip was adjusted too loosely on the float and needle to ensure a positive retraction of the needle. This allowed for the clip to stick in the down position and allowed an increased amount of fuel to enter the carburetor.  A blue silicone substance was found around the accelerator pump sump retainer and sump.  The accelerator pump discharge check valve was leaking and not sealing properly.  No further discrepancies were noted. ",
            "probable_cause": "The partial loss of engine power during cruise flight due to an improper maintenance adjustment to the float valve retractor clip of the carburetor.  Factors were the lack of suitable terrain for a forced landing and high vegetation. "

After an engine run up using a checklist,10-degrees of flaps was selected and he departed. After a positive rate of climb, the gear selector switch was placed in the up position; however, the gear remained down due to the automatic gear extender system installed on the aircraft which lowers the gear automatically when the airspeed is below a certain value.  Around 100 feet the engine suddenly quit. The pilot descended to maintain airspeed, and collided with trees. The next thing he remembers is being in the airplane on the ground. According to the FAA inspector who examined the accident site, the airplane impacted a dirt road with the landing gear extended and the left wing of the airplane separated after colliding with a light pole 6-7 feet above ground level. The airplane spun around and came to rest upright.  Examination of engine revealed crankshaft, camshaft, and valve train continuity; compression and suction were noted in all cylinders.

No preexisting mechanical anomalies were noted with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation, and propeller damage indicated the presence of engine power at impact. \u000b\u000bFellow pilots reported that the pilot was known for consistently flying correct patterns, was considered the most cautious in the group of banner pilots, and would radio anytime he thought something was abnormal, but he made no radio calls after the banner drop. The pilot had gone for a run earlier that morning. After the run, the pilot noted to another pilot how \u201cheavy\u201d the air felt and how he couldn\u2019t \u201cget a full breath.\u201d He twice stated to another pilot that he had a headache. He called his wife during the flight, and she reported that the conversation was \u201cnormal\u201d and that the pilot did not mention a headache. \u000b\u000bAutopsy results did not reveal evidence of pilot incapacitation; however, the heat from the postcrash fire affected the extent and fidelity of available medical evidence. However, other evidence, such as the pilot\u2019s failure to turn the airplane and add power as he normally would; his failure to announce any difficulties as he typically did; his failure to use other available landing sites, if needed, and instead continue straight ahead for 1/2 mile; and his failure to maintain airspeed suggests that it is likely that he was unable to perform basic piloting functions due to incapacitation.",

No records of telephone or computer contact by the pilot to either obtain preflight weather briefings or file any flight plans were located. There were no records of contact with air traffic controllers for any portion of the multi-leg flight. About 54 hours after the airplane\u2019s departure from Texas, an overflying airliner detected and reported a 121.5-MHz emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal. About 24 hours later, the wreckage was located by search personnel on a ridge at an elevation of about 11,700 feet. Detailed examination of the engine, propeller, and airframe did not reveal any preexisting mechanical deficiencies or failures that would have precluded normal operation. All damage patterns were consistent with controlled flight into terrain. AIRMETs for mountain obscuration, icing, and turbulence were in effect for the accident locale at the time of the accident. Ground- and satellite-based meteorological information indicated that instrument meteorological conditions and icing likely existed at the time and location of the accident. The accident occurred on the second leg of the second day of the trip. The majority of the 2-hour accident flight leg was conducted at 12,500 feet. Although the airplane was equipped with and the pilot had access to supplemental oxygen, it could not be determined whether he used it during the accident flight. Review of data from an onboard handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit indicated that, except for the accident flight, each leg of the trip was flown on a direct, straight-line route between the departure and destination airport. Flight track data indicated that, during the last 4 minutes of the accident flight, the airplane conducted a series of turning descents and climbs consistent with the pilot's likely attempt to navigate in and around weather in the mountainous terrain. The GPS unit incorporated a terrain database and terrain advisory features. The Sectional Aeronautical Chart maximum elevation figure (MEF) for the quadrangle that the accident occurred in was 12,800 feet. It could not be determined whether the pilot referenced, possessed, or used any sectional charts for the flight or whether he was aware of the published MEF.

After successfully completing a seed run, near the closed end of the canyon, he began a course reversal turn.  About halfway through the turn, the airplane experienced a rapid loss of altitude.  He ascertained that the airplane would not be able to complete the turn, and leveled the wings.  The airplane stalled, and collided with flat terrain on the side of the mountain.

As the balloon got closer to the surface, the wind started moving the balloon south, then southeast. The pilot landed the balloon in a field on the north side of a highway. The pilot reported that, during the landing, the balloon was accelerating, so he leveled off about 10 feet above the ground and then opened up the top of the envelope. The balloon solidly hit the ground and was dragged for about 100 feet before stopping. A review of meteorological data available at the time of the preflight briefing indicated, in part, that wind from the west existed at 10 knots or less before takeoff. The National Weather Service (NWS) terminal area forecast expected easterly wind shifting to the northwest during the anticipated flight at 13 knots with wind from the north gusting to 23 knots after 1000 mountain daylight time. The NWS area forecast did not expect any high winds across Colorado. The NWS Aviation Forecast Center had no advisories current for low-level turbulence or high winds over Colorado surrounding the anticipated flight. However, shortly after takeoff a sudden increase in windspeed occurred across the region with wind gusts from 20 to 38 knots. The NWS misjudged the timing and underestimated the magnitude of the frontal boundary moving across the region. It is likely that, if the pilot had known about the gusting wind at the time of takeoff, he may not have chosen to fly that day.",

Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, with reported visibilities at 60 miles. Neither pilot was receiving air traffic control advisories at the time of the collision.

The Cessna 172 continued northbound, as it entered a descent and impacted the ground.The pilot of the Cessna 180 airplane stated that she heard a loud bang during cruise flight and the airplane immediately pitched up and rolled into right bank. She subsequently determined that elevator control was limited. The pilot attempted to divert to a local airport, but was unable to land on a runway due to the impaired airplane control. She executed a forced landing to an open area adjacent to the airport. A witness reported that the right horizontal stabilizer of the Cessna 180 appeared to be bent down about 90 degrees at mid-span as the airplane approached for the forced landing. The outboard portion of the right horizontal stabilizer of the Cessna 180 airplane was structurally compromised, which resulted in a nearly complete loss of pitch control. The pilot of the Cessna 180 airplane retained marginal pitch control by varying engine power during the remainder of the flight.A postaccident examination did not reveal any pre-collision failures or malfunctions associated with either airplane. The examination determined that the left aileron/wing of the Cessna 172 likely contacted the right horizontal stabilizer of the Cessna 180 in flight.
