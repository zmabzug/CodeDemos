The engine had been removed by the previous owner, rebuilt, serviced, installed on the glider, and placed in storage. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector disassembled the engine after the accident. Prior to disassembly, the oil tank indicated that it was full of oil. Disassembly of the engine revealed the rotary valve disc drive gear had failed due to insufficient lubrication. There were about 2 ounces of oil drained from the oil bath reservoir. The engine manufacturer's installation manual indicated that if the vent plug in the engine case is not removed when servicing the engine with oil. The oil reservoir can indicate it is full of oil, and an air bubble can form which will prevent oil from filling the chamber.

During the climb after takeoff, the right-wing fuel cap came off of the wing, remaining attached only by the chain. An estimated 11 gallons of fuel was siphoned from the wing before the pilot returned to the airport and taxied back to the FBO. The pilot secured the cap and conducted a visual inspection of the right wing, before attempting to start the engine again. The right engine backfired, followed by a loud bang and whoosh sound; flames then rose from the right wing. A postaccident examination of the right wing revealed that the internal blast was a result of the backfire igniting fuel vapors that remained after the siphoning. The blast caused the upper wing skin to expand and separate from the retaining rivets. A soot trail originated at the exhaust pipes and traveled in an aft direction to the trailing edge of the wing.

After practicing several successful takeoffs and landings, the flight instructor had the private pilot set-up for a full stop wheel landing to runway 16, which had a six knot, 45 degree crosswind.  While in ground effect, the private pilot reduced the throttle too fast, which increased the sink rate and the aircraft touched down firmly on the mains.  The private pilot arrested the bounce with forward pressure before the aircraft lifted off, and applied some power to maintain directional control.  The aircraft then began to make an excursion from the runway centerline and the private pilot lowered the tail which made the aircraft unstable.  The flight instructor then assisted the private pilot and stabilized the aircraft.  The private pilot then indicated that he could handle the situation, and the flight instructor returned control back to the private pilot.  The flight instructor stated that he may have returned control back to the private pilot too quickly, as the situation degraded to large excursion from centerline, and the aircraft diverted from normal track.  The flight instructor was not able to regain directional control and the aircraft ground looped to the left.  During the ground loop, the right wing and elevator contacted the ground and were structurally damaged.",

After the airplane was chocked and the engines were shut down, the first officer immediately performed his preflight inspection.  A ground baggage handler, who was driving a tug towing a train of baggage carts, said that he approached the airplane from aft to forward, but had to maneuver around another train of carts to get close to the belt loader.  After loading the carts with baggage, he attempted to drive away.  He stated, \"I was hoping to make it out, but I felt my tug going against something.  I immediately set my foot on the brakes and glanced at the body [in moderate rain] of the aircraft to see if there was any damage.  It was a quick glance and I did not see any damage.\"  He did not report the incident to anyone.  The pilot said that the takeoff was normal.  During the climb out, at approximately 26,000 feet, they heard a loud bang, and the cabin depressurized.  He said that they put their oxygen masks on, and coordinated a descent to a lower altitude with Seattle Center.  An uneventful landing was performed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Seattle, Washington.  Post landing examination of the fuselage revealed a 12 by 6 inch hole between the middle and forward cargo doors on the right side of the airplane.  After the occurrence, the ground baggage handler confessed that he had \"grazed the airplane\" with a tug, while attempting to depart the vicinity of the airplane.  ",

The pilot landed in an open field off the end of the runway. During the landing the nose wheel sank into the soft ground, collapsed, and the airplane nosed into the ground.  The pilot reported that both wing fuel tanks were full and the engine run up was normal. During the post accident airplane examination fuel was identified in both wing tanks, the fuselage header tank, and the main fuel valve was observed rotated to the 2 o\u2019clock position.  The valve was a two position valve; \"off\" when positioned to  9 o\u2019clock, and \"on\" when positioned to 12 o\u2019clock. Investigators observed that the valve had no positive stops and could be rotated past the 9 o\u2019clock or 12 o\u2019clock positions.  The valve was located on the far left bottom side of the instrument panel, about knee level, which was not the standard location for the valve. During the post accident examination of the engine, investigators were able to run the engine up to 2,500 rpm, and noted that if the operator in the left seat moved his left knee to the left, it would push on the fuel valve, rotating it to the 2 o\u2019clock position.

A passenger heard a \"roar\" through the four-way intercom.  The certified flight instructor (CFI) and the student pilot checked the oil pressure and fuel pressure; both were \"good.\"  The CFI pointed to the left and directed the student toward a private strip.  During or immediately following the left turn, the CFI said, \"I've got it.\"  The student looked back at the two passengers, and motioned with his right hand that they were going to land at the strip.  The last thing that the passenger remembered was contact with the trees and coming to rest.  The airplane cleared a ridge top, but collided with trees about 1/4 mile from the landing strip.  The spark plug for cylinder no. 1 sustained mechanical damage and contained metallic debris.  The head of the cylinder no. 1 exhaust valve was missing, and the top of the piston exhibited mechanical damage across its entire surface.  Metallurgists examined the valve and cylinder.  The valve stem was broken and remained in the valve guide.  The stem fractured and there were numerous secondary cracks below the fracture surface.  The areas around the valve seats were severely damaged.  The fracture surface condition was such that the fracture mechanism could not be determined.  The secondary cracks were only in a local area where the material was severely battered and deformed.  Many of the cracks were slightly curved and/or did not appear to be perpendicular to the outer or inner surface.  These types of cracks are most likely to occur where surfaces have overlapped, or are the result of the excessive local strains in the area.  There were no material or dimensional abnormalities that would suggest fatigue.  The manufacturer issued maintenance instructions describing methods for determining exhaust valve and guide condition.  This maintenance function was optional for the operator, and maintenance records indicated that this had not been done.  Although the diameter of the exhaust valve stem was slightly below the specified diameter, this would have a small affect on overall stresses.  However, a small change in diameter of the valve stem significantly changes the amount of clearance between the exhaust valve stem and the exhaust valve guide.  Excessive clearance can lead to exhaust valve sticking, which can lead to overstress fracture.  The engine total time was 2,079 hours, and it had not been overhauled since it was new in 1975.  The manufacturer recommended overhaul at 2,000 hours or after 12 years of service life.  Given the high hours on this engine and the number of years since overhaul, it was likely that the failure was due to exhaust valve sticking.",

The controller vectored the C-17 onto the base leg of the traffic pattern ahead of the B737 to join the localizer for the approach. At this point, the airplanes were separated by 4.45 miles on a converging course with a closure rate of 180 knots. The C-17 was subsequently vectored to join the localizer and cleared for the approach. The controller then issued a wake turbulence advisory to the B737 and informed the pilot he would be 4 miles in trail of the C-17. The pilot of the B737 acknowledged the advisory, but, at this point, the airplanes were 3.62 miles apart. The minimum required wake turbulence separation was 5 miles. Both airplanes were directed to contact the air traffic control tower local controller. As both airplanes reduced their speeds for landing during final approach, their separation was reduced to 2.81 miles. The minimum instrument flight rules separation was 3 miles. The local controller authorized the B737 to make \"S\" turns on final approach to increase separation; however, when the B737 was 2 miles from the landing threshold, the B737 pilot told the local controller, \"it doesn't look like we're going to make this,\" since the C-17 was still conducting the landing roll on the runway. The B737 pilot was instructed to perform a go-around, entered a left downwind for the runway, and landed uneventfully. The TRACON controller responsible for the wake turbulence operational error reported after the incident that he confused the minimum wake turbulence separation requirements for a B737 following a C-17 with the requirement for a B757 following a B757. The B757 requirement was 4 miles. The TRACON controller had been involved in 4 other operational errors in the 4 years preceding this incident.",

The pilot advised the air traffic controller before departure that he did not want to execute any instrument landing system (ILS) approaches even though they were in use at the time, and neither transceiver was configured to the localizer frequency. Due to the mountainous terrain surrounding the airport, local air traffic control (ATC) had designated certain mode 3 transponder codes that inhibit minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) processing for a controller. This was accomplished to prevent repeated nuisance alarms for aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR) and not requesting MSAW processing. The pilot did not request MSAW monitoring before departure or at any time during the flight; therefore, the assigned VFR transponder code (0210) inhibited the MSAW. The pilot departed the flight with a reported ceiling of 1,500 feet and 10 miles visibility before proceeding south of the departure airport and electing to return, remaining in constant contact with ATC. While operating only several hundred feet above mountainous terrain, in instrument flight rules conditions due to fog, the pilot did not advise the controller of the weather encountered. While being vectored towards the airport, the airplane impacted trees then terrain at an elevation of approximately 2,809 feet mean sea level.

The commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by Reynolds Flying Service Inc. under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 without a flight plan. Day meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The local aerial-application flight had departed McCrory/Morton Airport (7M0), McCrory, Arkansas, at 1100.A witness to the accident, who was piloting another aerial-application airplane about 1/4 mile from the field where the accident airplane had been operating, reported that the accident pilot transmitted over the radio that he had \"messed up\" and that his airplane had collided with a pole. The accident pilot also reported having an unspecified flight control issue following the collision with the pole. The witness located the accident airplane and maneuvered his airplane closer to render assistance. The witness reported that the accident airplane remained in level flight for about a mile before it entered a slow right roll. The airplane continued the roll as it descended into a forested area. The witness reported that the airplane impacted trees in a slight right wing down, nose low, attitude. The witness reported seeing an explosion upon the airplane colliding with the trees. He estimated that 30-45 seconds had elapsed between the impact with the telephone pole and when the airplane descended into the forested area.The closest aviation weather observing station was located at the Searcy Municipal Airport (SRC), Searcy, Arkansas, about 26 miles west of the accident site.

The pilot attempted to fly to the nearest airport maintaining a 500 to 800 foot per minute descent.  Unable to make it to the airport, he chose a field in which to land.  He stated he cleared the trees, which surrounded the field, and applied flaps to slow the airplane.  The field was muddy so the pilot used the emergency gear extension to lower the landing gear so the airplane would not slide into the trees.  The airplane touched down and slid approximately 25 feet prior to coming to rest.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage.  An engine teardown revealed holes in the crankcase near the number four cylinder and that the engine had sustained both thermal and mechanical damage as a result of oil starvation.

During the takeoff roll, the gyroplane lifted off abruptly, and the main rotor blades struck the runway surface near the location where the gyroplane lifted off.  The gyroplane then climbed steeply to an altitude of less than 100 feet above the ground, and went through one or more longitudinal axis pitch oscillations.  The main rotor was observed to slow down and strike the tail-mounted rudder.  The gyroplane then descended to the runway in a steep nose-down attitude.  Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preexisting mechanical anomalies.  The gyroplane kit was purchased by the pilot in April, 2000.  It was assembled by the pilot/owner in Alaska, and transported to Alabama in January, 2002.  The pilot began receiving flight training in the gyroplane on January 16, 2002, and concluded training on February 2, 2002.  On February 3, 2002, the pilot completed an application for a private pilot, rotorcraft gyroplane rating, and the application was endorsed by the pilot's flight instructor.  According to the pilot's flight instructor, the pilot planned to travel from Alabama to Alaska, and planned to complete the practical (flight) test portion of the gyroplane rating either enroute or in Alaska.  Application for an additional gyroplane rating requires that the applicant accumulate at least 40 hours of flight time that includes at least 20 hours of flight training, and 10 hours of solo flight, and complete a practical test.  No additional written test is required.  On the application, the pilot listed 42.4 hours in a gyroplane, 32.2 hours of instruction, and 10.2 hours of solo flight.  The pilot did not complete the practical test for a rotorcraft gyroplane rating.  His last flight in the gyroplane was four months before the accident.  A postmortem examination of the pilot attributed the cause of death for the pilot to blunt force injuries.  Additionally, the examination found severe (60 to 70 percent) occlusive arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  The FAA's Rotorcraft Flying Handbook contains a discussion of pilot-induced oscillation (PIO), and power pushover situations.  The handbook notes that gyroplanes experience a slight delay between control input and the reaction of the aircraft.  This delay may cause an inexperienced pilot to apply more control input than required, resulting in a greater aircraft response than was desired. Once the error has been recognized, opposite control input is applied to correct the flight attitude.  Because of the nature of the delay in aircraft response, it is possible for the corrections to be out of synchronization with the movements of the aircraft and aggravate the undesired changes in attitude. The result is pilot-induced oscillations that can grow rapidly in magnitude.  A power pushover, as described in the FAA handbook, may result if rotor force is rapidly removed, producing a tendency to pitch forward abruptly.  This is often referred to as a forward tumble, buntover, or power pushover.  Removing the rotor force is often referred to as unloading the rotor, and can occur if pilot-induced oscillations become excessive.  A power pushover can occur on some gyroplanes that have the propeller thrust line above the center of gravity and do not have an adequate horizontal stabilizer.  In this case, when the rotor is unloaded, the propeller thrust magnifies the pitching moment around the center of gravity.  This nose pitching action could become self-sustaining and irreversible.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's abrupt liftoff during takeoff, and his failure to correct a pilot-induced-oscillation during takeoff initial climb which resulted in the main rotor blades striking the tail mounted rudder, and an in-flight loss of control.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's lack of recent experience in a gyroplane."

The typical procedure was to fly low and slow on a path parallel to, and in the same direction as, the target boat; pass the boat; make a climbing 180-degree course reversal turn around the bow of the boat; and then descend and proceed to the next boat. During their second flight of the day, while nearing the completion of the course reversal turn to the right after a photo pass, the pilot initiated the descent for the next photo pass. The pilot added power and collective pitch to arrest the descent; however, he was unable to do so before the helicopter impacted the water. Although the tail boom was not recovered, no evidence of any preimpact failures with the helicopter was observed in the recovered wreckage. \u000b\u000bThe course reversal turn was made from north to south, and the wind at an airport 17 miles to the northwest was out of the north at 15 knots. The pilot reported that the wind was about 12 knots gusting to 17 knots and that \u201cclear air turbulence\u201d was present. Although the exact wind conditions at the accident site were not known, evidence indicated that the helicopter experienced an overall wind change from a 12- to 15-knot headwind to a similar magnitude tailwind during the course reversal turn. Given the low speed of the photo pass, it is likely that the pilot did not correctly compensate for the wind speed and direction change during the course reversal and that the helicopter entered a vortex ring state (settling with power) due to the combination of low forward speed and the tailwind. The pilot\u2019s perception of, or attention to, the airspeed could have been adversely affected by his extra-cockpit focus on locating and tracking target boats. \u000b\u000bThe pilot\u2019s attempt to arrest the descent by adding power and collective pitch was not the proper technique for recovery from the vortex ring state, but no evidence suggests that the pilot even recognized the onset of that condition. However, even if he did recognize its onset, the helicopter\u2019s altitude was likely too low to safely exit the vortex ring state because proper recovery from that state requires increasing the airspeed and/or lowering the collective pitch, which respectively either requires or results in a temporarily increased descent. Further, it is likely that the pilot was operating in a region of the height-velocity chart such that an autorotation would not have been successful.\u000b",

When he filed an IFR flight plan, he told the briefer that he did not have his charts; the briefer looked up the airway designations & fixes for the plt. Near the destination, TRACON told the plt the airport (arpt) was below minimums, & that 3 aircraft (acft) had made missed approaches without seeing the ground. The controller then suggested nearby arpts that were above approach minimums as alternates. The plt said his car was parked at the arpt, & he wanted to make the approach. Radar data disclosed the acft flew the approach segments at least 1,000 higher than the charted altitudes at speeds between 180 & 155 kts. The acft overflew the missed approach point & arpt, then crossed the adjacent US/Mexico border before ATC could instruct the plt to make an immediate missed approach. The plt responded on the radio 'I guess I don't know where I am.'  Radar data showed the acft climbing & descending rapidly as it reversed course, then descend to 300 ft agl as it neared the west arpt boundary. The plt transmitted that he thought he had the arpt in sight. Four seconds later, the acft impacted the departure end of the runway. Ground witnesses observed the acft in cloud bases, & they noted that it narrowly missed a building; it then turned sharply toward the runway before descending steeply to ground impact.

            "narrative": "On July 7, 2015, at 1100 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 150M, N3601V, and a Lockheed-Martin F-16CM, operated by the U.S. Air Force (USAF), collided in midair near Moncks Corner, South Carolina. The Cessna was destroyed during the collision, and both the private pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The damaged F-16 continued to fly for an additional 3 minutes until the pilot activated the airplane's ejection system. The F-16 was destroyed following the subsequent collision with terrain and post-impact fire, while the pilot landed safely and was uninjured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the Cessna, while the F-16 was operating on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The Cessna departed from Berkley County Airport (MKS), Moncks Corner, South Carolina, at 1057, and was destined for Grand Strand Airport (CRE), North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; the personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The F-16 had departed from Shaw Air Force Base (SSC), Sumter, South Carolina about 1020.According to the USAF, after departing from SSC, the F-16 proceeded to Myrtle Beach International Airport (MYR), Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where the pilot conducted two practice instrument approaches before continuing the flight to Charleston Air Force Base/International Airport (CHS), Charleston, South Carolina. According to preliminary air traffic control (ATC) radar and voice communication data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the F-16 pilot contacted the approach controller at CHS about 1052 and requested to perform a practice tactical air navigation system (TACAN) instrument approach to runway 15. The controller subsequently instructed the F-16 pilot to fly a heading of 260 degrees to intercept the final approach course. At 1055, the controller instructed the F-16 pilot to descend from his present altitude of 6,000 feet to 1,600 feet. About that time, the F-16 was located about 34 nautical miles northeast of CHS.At 1057:41, a radar target displaying a visual flight rules transponder code of 1200, and later correlated to be the accident Cessna, appeared in the vicinity of the departure end of runway 23 at MKS, at an indicated altitude of 200 feet. The Cessna continued its climb, and began tracking generally southeast over the next 3 minutes. For the duration of its flight, the pilot of the Cessna did not contact CHS approach control, nor was he required to do so. At 1100:18, the controller advised the pilot of the F-16, \"traffic 12 o'clock, 2 miles, opposite direction, 1,200 [feet altitude] indicated, type unknown.\" The F-16 pilot responded and advised the controller that he was \"looking\" for the traffic. At 1100:26, the controller advised the F-16 pilot, \"turn left heading 180 if you don't have that traffic in sight.\" The pilot responded by asking, \"confirm 2 miles?\" Eight seconds later, the controller stated, \"if you don't have that traffic in sight turn left heading 180 immediately.\" Over the next 18 seconds, the track of the F-16 began turning southerly.At 1100:49, the radar target of the F-16 was located 1/2 nautical mile northeast of the Cessna, at an indicated altitude of 1,500 feet, and was on an approximate track of 215 degrees. At that time, the Cessna reported an indicated altitude of 1,400 feet, and was established on an approximate track of 110 degrees. At 1100:52 the controller advised the F-16 pilot, \"traffic passing below you 1,400 feet.\" At 1100:54, the radar reported altitude of the F-16 remained at 1,500 feet and no valid altitude information was returned for the radar target associated with the Cessna. At that point the targets were laterally separated by about 1,000 feet. No further radar targets were received from the Cessna, and the next radar target for the F-16 was not received until 1101:13. At 1101:19, the F-16 pilot transmitted a distress call, and no subsequent transmissions were received. Air traffic control radar continued to track the F-16 as it proceeded on a roughly southerly track, and after descending to an indicated altitude of 300 feet, radar contact was lost at 1103:17 in the vicinity of the F-16 crash site.The wreckage of the Cessna was recovered in the vicinity of its last observed radar target, over the west branch of the Cooper River. Components from both airplanes were spread over an area to the north and west of that point, extending for approximately 1,200 feet. The largest portions of the Cessna's airframe included a relatively intact portion of the fuselage aft of the main landing gear, and the separate left and right wings, all of which were within 500 feet northwest of the airplane's final radar-observed position. Portions of the cabin interior, instrument panel, fuel system, and engine firewall were found distributed throughout the site. The engine, propeller, and nose landing gear assembly were not recovered. The lower aft engine cowling of the F-16 was also recovered in the immediate vicinity of the Cessna's aft fuselage, while the F-16's engine augmenter was recovered about 1,500 feet southwest. Small pieces of the F-16's airframe were also distributed throughout the accident site.Both of the Cessna's wings displayed uniform leading edge crush damage throughout their spans that was oriented aft and upward. Paint transfer and rub markings oriented in a direction from the airplane's left to right were observed on the upper forward surfaces of both wings. Both fuel tanks were ruptured, and evidence of heat damage and paint blistering were observed on the upper surface of the right wing. Flight control continuity was traced through overload-type cable separations from the cabin area to each flight control surface. Measurement of the pitch trim actuator showed a position consistent with a 3 to 4-degree deflection of the tab in the nose down direction, and measurement of the flap actuator showed a position consistent with the flaps having been in the retracted position.The F-16 wreckage site was located about 6 nautical miles south of the Cessna wreckage site. The F-16 wreckage path was about 700 feet long and oriented roughly 215 degrees, with portions of the airframe distributed along the wreckage path. The wreckage displayed significant ground impact and post-impact fire-related damage. A crash-survivable memory unit (CSMU) was recovered from the wreckage, and the digital flight control system seat data recorder (DFLCS SDR) was recovered from the airplane's ejection seat. Both memory units were forwarded to the airframe manufacturer for data extraction under the supervision of an NTSB Vehicle Recorder Specialist.The weather conditions reported at MKS at 1055 included calm winds, 10 statute miles visibility, scattered clouds at 2,600 feet agl, a temperature of 30 degrees C, a dew point of 22 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.15 inches of mercury.",

Shortly after takeoff, the 1,493-hour instrument rated private pilot informed air traffic control that a \"door had opened\" and that he needed to return to the airport.  The pilot leveled off at an altitude of 200 feet msl at an airspeed of 100 knots and proceeded to make two left turns to enter the downwind leg of the traffic pattern.  Radar data revealed that while on the downwind leg, the airplane's ground speed decelerated to 70 knots.  When the airplane was about one-mile beyond the end of the runway, it began another left turn before it collided with trees in the backyard of a private residence.  A witness heard a large shaking sound similar to a semi-type truck braking down in front of his home.  He then looked up and saw the airplane flying \"very slow\" about 20-feet-high above the tree line.  The witness demonstrated with a model airplane that the airplane had a slightly nose-high attitude and was in a shallow left turn.  The airplane was shaking violently.  The witness then maneuvered the model airplane so it simultaneously rolled rapidly to the left (inverted) and the nose of the airplane dropped toward the ground.  The witness said he lost sight of the airplane as it descended into the trees.  Raytheon released a Mandatory Service Bulletin and a Safety Communique regarding doors opening in flight on this and other model airplanes in 1990.

Both crewmembers said they never saw the tug until after the collision, and when the aircraft door was opened, they realized that the baggage vehicle had collided with their aircraft. The police report showed that the pilot had said in his initial report, that he felt as if the left wing had been pushed hard and he had observed that the aircraft's left propeller and wing, as well as the rear baggage carts were damaged. The police report also showed that the baggage cart had been equipped with no lights, only reflectors, and that the distance from the center of the yellow taxi line to the impact point where the debris lay was about 30 feet. In addition, a ramp control incident report showed that in addition to the debris being located 30 feet from the yellow line, the debris was also located 73 feet from the aircraft containment line. The tug driver stated that he had been driving as close to the fuchsia (red) line as was possible, when the collision occurred. The ramp supervisor who was marshalling the aircraft and witnessed the collision stated that he was 100 feet away, and observed that the tug and cart was coming from the left side of the aircraft, trying to cross the taxiway from one side to the other, and the tug driver did not notice the aircraft taxiing in, and tried to avoid hitting the aircraft by making a turn to the left, but he hit the airplane with the cart, causing damage to the airplane's left wing and propeller.

The pilot reported that, at 4,000 feet msl, the engine began to lose power. The pilot stated that he cycled the throttle and then the propeller, but the engine power was not restored. The pilot then turned on the fuel boost pump with no change in power noted. The pilot said that he did not apply carburetor heat. The pilot said that, about 300 to 400 feet above ground level, the engine \"finally reached what felt like near idle.\" During the forced landing, the airplane collided with an embankment.The regional weather conditions at the time of the accident were such that the route of flight was directly into a cold front with increasing moisture and relative humidity. A weather station about 11 nautical miles from the accident site reported a temperature of 32 degrees F and dew point of 30 degrees F at the time of the accident. These weather conditions were conducive to the formation of serious carburetor icing at cruise power. A postaccident examination of the engine found no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely the engine began to lose power due to carburetor ice and that the timely application of carburetor heat would have restored engine power.",

Maintenance cleaned the spark plugs, performed an engine run-up, and returned the airplane to service.  The pilot passed the check out flight and was provided the airplane.  The CFI reportedly advised the pilot that if there was any maintenance problem to have the airplane worked on and the maintenance cost would be deducted.  The day before the accident the pilot flew the airplane to Milton, Florida, and landed uneventfully where the airplane remained overnight.  No maintenance was performed or requested, and no fuel was purchased.  The pilot and three passengers boarded the airplane for a local flight and three witnesses, one of whom is an A & P mechanic, reported hearing the pilot having trouble starting the engine.  The engine ran rough after starting, and the airplane was taxied to the approach end of runway 36 where the pilot performed an engine run-up.  Several witnesses including the A & P mechanic reported hearing a discrepancy during the magneto check.  The pilot was heard increasing the engine rpm while at the engine run-up area.  During the takeoff roll one witness reported that the engine was, \"making sounds as if it was not developing power.\"  Several witnesses noted the airplane did not become airborne until approximately 3/4 down the 3,700 foot-long runway, or approximately 2,828 feet down the runway.  Conservative takeoff distances for ground roll and distance to clear a 50 foot obstacle per the airplane \"Information Manual\" were 910 and 1,745 feet, respectively.  The airplane began climbing to an estimated height of 100 feet, and the landing gear was noted to retract.  One witness reported the airplane flew over her position and the engine was heard to be running rough.  A pilot who was flying in the area at the time observed the airplane turn onto the downwind leg, stall, then pitch straight down.  The airplane crashed in the side yard of a residence located approximately .30 nautical mile and 303 degrees from the departure end of runway 36.  Examination of the flight controls and power section of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  The ignition harness was impact damaged which precluded testing.  Examination of the heat damaged magneto revealed the left capacitor was shorted to ground consistent with heat damage, while the right capacitor was functional.  Heat damaged components were replaced, the magneto was placed on a test bench and operated with no discrepancies noted.  Examination of the impact and heat damaged carburetor revealed the accelerator pump piston seal was badly worn exposing most of the sealing spring; the worn seal would reportedly not result in increased fuel flow.  The as found setting of the economizer would result in a leaner fuel/air ratio.  Rust was noted in the drain cavity below the float bowl, on the inner portion of the carburetor bowl drain plug, and a small amount of debris was noted in the main bowl chamber.  Documents provided by the operator indicate a discrepancy related to excessive rpm decrease during a magneto check on August 27, 2004.

The pilot of the lead airplane reported that shortly after departure, they encountered some light rain, but saw no evidence of ice. As both airplanes approached a mountain pass near the accident site, they encountered light snow with a cloud ceiling of about 1,200 feet above ground level and 3 to 4 miles visibility. The lead pilot heard a blind transmission from the pilot of the accident airplane saying he was \"on the edge of a stall.\" No further radio transmissions were received from the accident pilot. The lead pilot stated that at the time of the radio transmission, he had no evidence of icing on his airplane or anything abnormal about the flight characteristics of his airplane.

The airplane struck the ground left wing first followed by the propeller and then the left side of the engine cowling.  The pilot reported that he had gone to the airport to pick-up the airplane after airframe maintenance had been completed.  The airplane had undergone repairs to the ailerons, flaps, rudder. flight instruments and avionics.  The pilot that test flew the airplane prior to the release reported flying the airplane on 3 separate flights to make rigging adjustments.  He added that all flight characteristics were normal.

During the ensuing autorotative landing glide, a main rotor blade struck a tree about 30 feet above ground level and the helicopter fell to the ground.  This was the first flight of the day and the helicopter had been stored outside overnight in conditions of cold temperatures and light snowfall without engine air inlet covers installed.  Prior to the flight the engine was difficult to start.  There were five aborted starts before the engine was successfully started.  During the first three start attempts, fuel was introduced, ignition occurred, the engine acceleration hung at 30 percent, and the starts were aborted.  After the third start attempt a mechanic noted that the engine inlets were approximately half blocked by snow and cleared the snow from the inlets using a towel.  He did not check the plenum chamber aft of the particle separator and forward of the engine inlet for snow.  In the wreckage, the plenum chamber inspection window was found to be opaque.  After the accident, another company mechanic who had dealt with the same starting difficulty on another helicopter of the same type parked under the same circumstances without inlet covers, reported finding the plenum chamber of that helicopter contained several cups of snow. The engine manufacturer reported that tests of the engine had shown that ingestion of as little as 6 ounces of snow/slush could flame out the engine.

The pilot proceeded towards an alternate airport, but was unable to land there and landed gear-up short of the intended runway. A total of 3 to 4 ounces of fuel were drained from the wing fuel tanks. No tank damage and no fuel leaks were noted from the fuel filler caps or fuel tank sump drain valves. Both fuel quantity gauges were noted to read empty when aircraft's battery power was applied. Although an engine-monitoring instrument with fuel flow capability was installed after the airplane was manufactured, installation instructions required placards to read that the airplane's fuel quantity gauges should be used to determine the fuel level in the tanks, and the original fuel flow gauge is the primary instrument for fuel flow. Postaccident examination of the instrument panel revealed neither placard was installed. Though the airplane was modified by installation of a turbocharger which required an increase in fuel flow, the increase was within the limits of the fuel flow transducer. The calculated average fuel flow during the accident flight was 10.3 gallons-per-hour, which was consistent with the average calculated fuel flows on two flights before the engine was overhauled.

The certified private pilot, the owner and sole occupant of the airplane, sustained fatal injuries. The local flight was being operated in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and a flight plan was not filed. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area of the accident at the time of the event. The flight had departed the Fall City Airport (1WA6), about 5 minutes prior to the accident, with its destination being Harvey Field (S43), Snohomish, Washington.In a postaccident interview, a family member reported that the pilot had intended to take the airplane to S43 that morning to undergo its scheduled annual inspection. The family member opined that the pilot would have never have taken off into the fog, that he was a very meticulous and cautious pilot in all regards, and that on many occasions the pilot would cancel a flight if there was the slightest discrepancy with the airplane.Several witnesses who were at the golf course at the time of the accident submitted statements to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC). One witness reported that he heard the airplane, but could not see it due to the fog and low ceiling, which was about 50 feet above ground level (agl). The witness stated that he looked toward the noise and observed the airplane heading west barely off of the ground prior to the right wing impacting a tree and subsequently hitting a second tree. A second witness, who reported that the overcast condition was between 100 to 150feet agl, stated that he heard the sound of a sputtering engine, which was immediately followed by a loud thud, \"\u2026and suddenly there was a plane, upside down, in the middle of the 9th fairway.\" A third witness estimated that the fog was about 20 feet off of the ground, and that he heard the airplane flying over but could not see it. He heard the engine \"\u2026throttling up, then back, and then throttling up really heavy\" right before impact. A fourth witness reported that the vertical visibility was about 75 feet due to the fog. He heard the airplane take off, which he thought was to the west, made a right turn, headed north, then made a left turn heading south over the Snoqualmie River. The witness stated that he observed the airplane flying directly overhead at about 75 feet heading south, and then about 5 seconds later heard one explosion. A fifth witness reported, that while he never saw the airplane due to the very low fog, he believed he heard it flying for about 1 to 2 minutes during which he heard the engine throttle up, then throttle back before the airplane impacted the tree.A survey of the accident site was performed by representatives from the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration. The examination revealed that the airplane initially impacted a tree about 80 feet in height at about the 15-foot level with its outboard right wing section, on a measured magnetic heading of 270 degrees. Subsequent to the initial impact, the airplane continued on a heading of west for about 200 feet before it impacted a second tree of about equal height as the first. The impact occurred at about the 18-foot level, head on with the engine and at a high rate of speed; the engine subsequently separated and was located at the base of the tree. The airplane's fuselage and left wing, minus its engine, then traveled around the north side of the tree on a heading of west for about 60 feet before coming to rest inverted and partially on its right side. The fuselage came to rest oriented on a measured magnetic heading of 093 degrees; the left wing had separated from the fuselage during the final segment of the accident sequence, and was located about 20 feet southwest of the fuselage. It was also observed that the airplane's battery, which had been ejected during the accident sequence, had come to rest about 150 feet west of the main wreckage. Two fuel stains were also observed between the second tree impacted and the fuselage; the first covered an area of about 2,150 square feet (sf), while the second covered an area of about 570 sf.All components necessary for flight were accounted for at the accident site. The airplane was recovered to a secured storage facility for further examination.",

During the takeoff roll, as the airplane's airspeed approached 60 knots, the pilot applied aft control yoke pressure to rotate the nose of the airplane.  When the desired pitch angle for takeoff was attained, she released the back pressure, but the yoke failed to move forward.  The airplane then pitched-up uncontrollably, and she disengaged the electric trim, as she was concerned about a runaway trim condition.  She regained control of the airplane, noted that she had very limited aileron and elevator range of motion available, and elected to continue straight ahead to her next scheduled stop.  She added that she tried to transmit a \"mayday\"  to other airplane\u2019s in the area, but the radio transmit button, located on the pilot's control yoke, was now inoperative.  During the short flight, she was able to adjust the altitude and airspeed by adjusting engine power.  During approach to the accident airport, while using a combination of engine power, rudder, and the remaining amount of aileron control, she was able to maneuver the airplane for landing on runway 05.  As the airplane passed over the approach end of the runway, she attempted to flare just before touchdown.  The nose of the airplane failed to rise, and the nose wheel struck the gravel-covered runway.  The nose landing gear collapsed, and the airplane bounced off the right side of the runway.  A postaccident examination of the control yoke mechanism, behind the instrument panel, revealed that a wiring harness had become entangled in a series of roller bearings associated with the control yoke mechanism.  A subsequent inspection revealed that the accident airplane's control column did not have a required STA-Strap, part number S-2209-2, installed.  The proper installation of the required STA-Strap would provide proper clearance between the wiring harness, and the control yoke roller bearings.  The roller bearing assembly was disassembled, and the entangled wiring harness was removed.  The correct length for the factory installed wiring harness is 49 inches.  The wiring harness that was removed from the roller bearing assembly measured at 34 inches.  A review of the airplane's maintenance history disclosed no maintenance activity concerning the control yoke assembly.

The pilot told a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that the landing gear strut collapsed unexpectedly, and without warning, during the landing roll, and the airplane ground looped to the right.  It was not subjected to an abnormal load during landing and the airplane was relatively light with no chemical load aboard and about 1,300 pounds of fuel.  The inspector examined the airplane and said the left landing gear leaf broke inside the saddle.  There was rust and beach marks in the fracture face indicative of a pre-existing crack.  The FAA inspector said the left landing gear strut, a single spring steel leaf, separated in the shoulder area where the strut enters the saddle at the fuselage skin line.  The left landing gear wheel was broken in the outboard flange area and the tire was deflated.  The tire exhibited deep radial scratch marks on the outboard side wall.  The aileron hinge bracket at the left wing tip was bent inboard and striations on the left wing lower surface were oriented spanwise.  The left wing outer half-span was bent upward accompanied by compression wrinkling of the upper wing skin.  Examination of the fracture by a metallurgical laboratory revealed that the strut met the manufacturer's chemical, hardness, and materials specifications for the component.  The fracture through the strut was characterized by two distinct modes.  The first was 0.08 inches in depth and 0.37 inches in width and exhibited features consistent with fatigue.  The fatigue crack had multiple initiation sites along the top surface in an area that had fretting damage.  The remainder of the fracture face displayed gross overload features.

He originally planned to have 2 passengers on the flight but one of the passengers decided not to go.  He and his wife arrived at the airport and the owner of the facility that rented the airplane to him asked him how much fuel was needed.  A discussion with himself, the owner of the renting facility, and a certified flight instructor was held and it was agreed by all that a total of 40 gallons of fuel would be needed which included fuel for reserve.  At 1710, the operator placed a fuel order with the only fuel facility on the airport.  He performed his preflight inspection of the airplane at about 1740 hours which included a visual check of the fuel level in the fuel tanks.  He estimated the total fuel capacity at the time of takeoff was 30 gallons.  The engine was started at 1745, and taxied to runway 06.  The flight departed and climbed to 7,500 feet where the flight proceeded direct to the destination (Daytona Beach International Airport).  When the flight was just past Valdosta, he descended to 5,500 feet and remained at that altitude for a few minutes then descended to 3,000 feet to maintain VFR conditions.  The flight continued and the pilot further stated that when over the St. Johns River just west of St. Augustine, he descended to 1,500 feet to maintain VFR conditions.  When the flight was clear of weather he climbed to 2,500 feet and established radio contact with Daytona Beach Approach Control.  The controller \"gave us the go\" for a left base to runway 7L at his destination airport when the flight was 7 miles away.  At that time the engine lost power and he immediately switched to the left tank.  During the flight he had repositioned the fuel selector every 30 minutes.  The engine was operating so he elected to divert to Ormond Beach.  The controller asked if there was a problem and he replied he needed to stop for fuel.  The controller gave him a frequency change to the Ormond Beach UNICOM frequency, and there was no response to his radio calls.  He turned close in on the base leg and while on final approach, the engine \"cut out....\"  The propeller windmilled for a short time then stopped as the flight was clearing trees at the approach end of the runway.  The airplane was landed in grass short of the runway resulting in collapse of the nose landing gear and subsequent nose over.  He and the passenger (his wife) exited the airplane and walked to the airport for assistance.  He further reported there was no mechanical failure or malfunction.  According to a sergeant with the Ormond Beach Police Department who is familiar with aviation, the fuel tanks did not contain any fuel and there was no smell of fuel at the accident site or in the cabin.  According to an FAA inspector who examined the airplane, both fuel gauges indicated empty with electrical power applied, and both fuel tanks were empty.  The fuel selector was found positioned to the left fuel tank.  No fuel was found in the gascolator.  Examination of all engine controls and flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the propeller revealed 1 propeller blade was bent slightly at the tip.  Damage to the airframe precluded an engine run.  Examination of the engine revealed crankshaft and valve train continuity; no engine discrepancies were reported.  According to the operator of the airplane, the airplane was last fueled on May 22, 2003, which brought the fuel level to the bottom of the tabs in each fuel tank (15 gallons a side).  The engine was then operated for 24 minutes while on the ground; no flight was performed.  He checked the fuel level in both fuel tanks earlier in the day of the accident date and reported that the fuel level in the left tank was below the bottom of the tab and the fuel level in the right fuel tank was at the bottom of the tab.  He was aware that the accident pilot intended on flying the airplane and he asked the pilot how much fuel was needed for the trip.  The reply was both sides to the slot which would give 20 gallons a side.  He called the order in at 1710 hours.  According to the fuel facility located on the airport, the fuel request was made but the flight departed before the airplane was fueled.  Records provided by the owner indicate that at the time of the accident, the airplane had been operated for 2.7 hours since engine start.  According to the Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual, when fuel touches the bottom of the tab it indicates 15 gallons of fuel, of which 13.7 gallons are usable.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate preflight and his failure to refuel the airplane before departure resulting in the total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion and a hard landing during the subsequent forced landing."

A witness reported that the airplane\u2019s touchdown was \u201cfirm\u201d but not abnormal.

As the airplane began moving to the right side of the runway, the witness heard the right engine increase to near full power. The airplane spun to the left, coming to rest facing the opposite direction from its approach to landing. Another witness reported seeing the propellers contact the ground. The pilot attributed the loss of directional control to a main landing gear malfunction.Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the left propeller assembly was feathered and that the right propeller blades were bent forward, indicative of the right engine impacting terrain under high power. Both throttle levers were found in the aft/closed position, and both propeller control levers were in the full-forward position. The propeller control levers exhibited little friction and could be moved with pressure from one finger.
