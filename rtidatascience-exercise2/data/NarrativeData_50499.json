But, since the weather briefing he received forecast clouds, precipitation, and icing conditions along much of the route, the pilot elected not to attempt the flight but instead decided to wait until the next day. Although the weather briefer advised the pilot that the conditions he had described would still be present along the route of flight the next day, including areas of clouds, low ceilings, precipitation, icing conditions, snow, and thunderstorms, the pilot did not call back for an update briefing on the day of the flight, and he did not receive a weather briefing from either of the Direct User Access Terminal Service providers. It is possible that he may have accessed some raw weather data from a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration website before departing for his planned destination. Overlaying the airplane\u2019s radar track on weather radar imagery indicated that, about 30 minutes after departure, the pilot encountered the edge of the forecast weather conditions, entering an area of precipitation where supercooled liquid droplets had been forecast. This most likely resulted in a very rapid accumulation of ice on the airplane\u2019s structure, including its wings and horizontal stabilizer. Soon thereafter, the airplane entered a steep uncontrolled descent, during which the outboard section of the right wing separated as it was stressed beyond the design limitations of the airplane. The airplane continued in a near vertical uncontrolled descent and impacted the terrain with a high amount of energy. Postaccident examination of the airframe, flight controls, and the engine did not find any evidence of a preexisting anomaly.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s decision to continue flight into an area of known adverse weather, which resulted in an accumulation of structural ice that led to a loss of control and in-flight breakup. Also causal was the pilot\u2019s inadequate preflight weather planning."

A witness suggested the pilot delay the flight until a new starter could be obtained.  The pilot insisted he could takeoff, and said he had performed single engine takeoffs previously in the airplane.  He chose a point on the dry, 1,940 feet long, 90 feet msl, gravel runway where he would abort if the airplane was not airborne.  The witness said that as the airplane passed the abort point, the nose wheel was lifting off the ground.

The pilot, who had an expired student pilot certificate, was fatally injured. The gyroplane was owned and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local area flight that departed 7MI5 at an unknown time.An individual reported that the pilot had arrived at the departure airport around 1700 with the gyroplane on a trailer. There were no witnesses to the accident flight. On the morning of July 11, 2014, the gyroplane was found in a potato field located about 500 yards east of the departure airport. A wreckage debris path originated from the initial point-of-impact on a northerly heading and measured about 30 feet long. All airframe components were located along the wreckage debris path or amongst the main wreckage. Flight control continuity could not be established due to the extent of the damage; however, all observed flight control system discontinuities were consistent with overstress. One of the two main rotor blades had separated from the mast hub assembly; however, the observed damage to the separated rotor blade was consistent with impact damage. Examination of the engine revealed that the forward spark plug of the two-cylinder, two-stroke, Rotax model 532 engine was loose and could be removed by hand without the aid of any tools. No additional preimpact anomalies were noted with the engine that would have prevented its normal operation. Additionally, there was limited damage to the 3-blade propeller, the throttle was found in the full-aft position, and there was the smell of automobile fuel present at the accident site.On October 25, 2002, the pilot was issued a student pilot certificate in conjunction with the issuance of a third-class medical certificate. When applying for the medical certificate, the pilot reported having 45 hours total flight time, of which 22 hours had been accumulated during the 6 month period preceding the medical examination. A search of Federal Aviation Administration records did not reveal any subsequent issuances of any medical and/or pilot certificates.At 1735, the automated surface observing system (ASOS) located at Toledo Suburban Airport (DUH), about 9 miles south of the accident site, reported: wind from 120 degrees at 5 knots; visibility 10 miles; clear sky; temperature 25 degrees Celsius, dew point 14 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.14 inches of mercury.",

The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was not operated on a flight plan. The local flight originated from the Syracuse-Hamilton County Municipal Airport (3K3), Syracuse, Kansas at an undetermined time.A friend of the accident pilot, who also owned a Yak 52, noted that they had planned to meet at the airport about 1000 to conduct a fly-by in conjunction with the local Memorial Day events. When he arrived at the airport about 0900, the accident pilot's car was there, but his airplane was gone. He noted that the accident pilot commonly used his airplane to check on his cattle. He attempted to contact the accident pilot over the Unicom frequency without success. He subsequently took off about 1000 and maneuvered north of town. When the accident pilot did not arrive, he conducted the fly-by alone. He was notified of the accident after returning from the flight.A witness noted that the airplane was initially eastbound. She observed it make a right 180-degree turn to a west course. The airplane then \"dipped down\" (descended) until she lost sight of it momentarily, before it climbed back up. She noted that the airplane banked again and she was able to see both wings. She specifically noted that the wings were red, while the body of the airplane was white. The airplane leveled off again and then \"dipped\" again, momentarily losing sight of it again until it climbed up. The airplane then began what appeared to be a normal turn to the left toward the south when it \"fell straight down.\"  She explained that it did not appear to bank, but that it nosed down. The airplane descended below her line of sight and she heard a \"funny\" sound. When the airplane did not climb back up again, she thought that it had crashed. She notified the local authorities at that time.Local authorities received a call regarding a possible airplane crash at 0819. However, due to difficulties in locating the crash site, the airplane was not located until about 1130.The airplane impacted an open field about 3 miles southeast of 3K3. A ground impact mark was located about 21 feet west of the main wreckage. The impact mark was about 31 feet long and up to about 1 foot \u2013 9 inches in depth. The initial portion of the impact mark was oriented on an approximate 090-degree bearing, while the final portion was oriented about 110-degrees. The outboard portion of the right wing, about 5 feet in length, and the right main wheel assembly were located adjacent to and in the impact mark, respectively.The main wreckage consisted of the remainder of the airplane; specifically, the cowling, engine, propeller, fuselage, remaining portion of the right wing, the entire left wing, and the empennage. The engine cowling was deformed and partially separated. The engine was dislocated aft and to the right consistent with impact forces, with corresponding damage to the engine mount. Three cylinders were dislocated from the crankcase, but remained with the engine. One propeller blade was separated at the hub and fragmented. The outboard one-foot portion of the blade (blade tip) was recovered at the accident site, about 21 feet east-northeast of the main wreckage. The second propeller blade remained attached to the hub. That blade exhibited a delamination near mid-span, but appeared otherwise intact. The fuselage was deformed along its entire length, with the exception of the extreme aft fuselage.

Post accident inspection of the engine revealed the nozzle pressure port plug on the aft side of the fuel manifold valve was not in place, nor was it located.  Blue fuel stains were evident under the left magneto and on the engine case under the right cylinders.  The plug hole and the area surrounding the hole were inspected and there was no evidence of torque putty (Loctite) having been used when the plug was installed.  The injector line fittings and the fuel inlet fitting had torque putty applied to them.  The engine had operated 10.1 hours since it was overhauled.  Continental Motors reviewed their build-up procedures for the IO-550 engines and determined that the requirement for applying Loctite to the suspect fitting had been removed from the procedures.  Continental Motors subsequently issued a Quality Alert re-inserting the requirement for Loctite to be applied to the nozzle pressure port plug at installation.  The procedures manual and build-up instructions for the IO-550 were also revised to include the requirement that Loctite be applied to the plug.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the improper installation of the fuel nozzle.  Also causal was the engine manufacturer's improper installation instructions for the nozzle pressure port plug on the fuel manifold valve.   A factor associated with the accident was the corn crop which was contacted during the forced landing."

The pilot said that he turned back to the runway. He said that the engine was \"cutting off\" and that the airplane was \"sinking fast.\" He then feathered the propeller and kept the landing gear in the up position in order to extend his glide. He then put the gear handle down when he knew he would reach the runway, but the landing gear did not extend completely before the airplane's belly made contact with the pavement. About 9 months before the accident, the airplane had incurred a propeller strike while being taxied over a portion of uneven pavement. As a result, it underwent maintenance that required removal of the propeller and engine, disassembly and reassembly of the engine, remounting of the propeller and engine, and rigging. This was accomplished over a 4-month period by multiple maintenance personnel and required safety-ing of multiple engine components. Safety-ing, when done correctly, should never result in nicked, kinked, mutilated, or overstressed safety wire, as it will result in the safety wire breaking under vibrations if twisted too tightly. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the power turbine control (Py) line propeller governor fitting lockwire was fractured at the loop through the \u201cB\u201d nut lockwire hole. The nut was found to be backed off about 1/3 to 1/2 turn, and the line could be moved by hand. Functional tests with the \"B\" nut in its as-found configuration revealed that the engine would stay at sub-idle and would not respond to power lever movement. Macroscopic inspection of the fracture showed features characteristic of overload fracture in tension and torsion at the location of a pre-existing nick. It is likely that the improper securing of the \u201cB\u201d nut on the power turbine control line resulted in the loss of engine power.However, the pilot could have restored power to the engine by using the manual fuel override switch, which he did not attempt to use. Review of the pilot's operating handbook (POH) revealed that the POH contained guidance regarding the use of the manual fuel override, although all conditions for which it could be used were not clearly stated.Regardless, the pilot should have been aware of the guidance contained in the POH.

The controller issued a low altitude alert to the pilot and cleared him to land. The controller also reminded the pilot that the minimum descent altitude for the Localizer Directional Aid (LDA) approach was 440 feet, and provided instructions for the missed approach.  At that point the pilot reported that he had the airport in sight and acknowledged the landing instructions. The controller again cleared the pilot to land on the prescribed runway for the instrument approach, and the pilot acknowledged the landing clearance. Shortly thereafter the controller instructed the pilot to execute the missed approach as the radar track showed that the airplane was off course. The pilot was instructed to initiate a climbing left turn to the VOR. The pilot said he had the airport in sight and that he saw one of the cross runways and wanted to land. The controller told the pilot that circling to that runway was not an authorized procedure for the LDA approach and again instructed the pilot to perform the missed approach. A witness stated that he was working on a storage container, about 50 feet in height, when the airplane passed overhead.  He estimated the airplane to be about 50 feet higher than the storage container. The airplane made a turn westbound and the witness looked away for a second.  When he looked back the airplane was in a nose and left wing down attitude and then it impacted the ground.  Another witness located on the airport's north-northeast corner also observed the airplane flying toward the airport.  He reported simultaneously hearing the engine power up and observed the left wing stall prior to it impacting the ground.  Both witnesses reported that they did not hear anything wrong with the engine.  Examination of the airframe, power plant, and propeller revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Internal damage signatures in the engine and propeller were consistent with the production of significant power at the time of impact.  A review of the weather in the area revealed that while light rain and mist were occurring near the accident site, no meteorological phenomena existed that would have adversely affected the flight.",

The power check was good and a positive rate of climb was noted.  After landing and the crew had exited the aircraft, the pilot departed the area to locate a landing zone closer to the pickup point of the crew and patient.  A landing zone at the 6,600 foot level (MSL) was located 3/8 of a mile closer to the patient pickup point.  While waiting to load the patient the pilot determined a takeoff could be made based on his review of the aircraft's takeoff performance data.  After completing an in-ground-effect power check and initiating a vertical climbout, the pilot confirmed the helicopter would clear a 100 foot tree line as it began to transition forward.  After clearing the tree line the pilot detected the aircraft lose all lift as the helicopter began to settle toward the approaching trees.  Applying the remaining power, the RPM warning sounded, prompting the pilot to reduce collective, but only to realize that he was descending into approaching obstacles.  Right pedal was applied in an attempt to return to the original point of departure, however, the rotor RPM had still not completely recovered and the aircraft continued to descend.  The aircraft impacted a boulder, and with the RPM now fully recovered, the helicopter jumped back into the air.  The aircraft then rotated 180 degrees before the pilot performed a hover autorotation.  During the maneuver the tail rotor had impacted a tree branch which resulted in an 8 inch chord wise gash to one of the tail rotor blades.  The pilot felt that as the helicopter was clearing the tree line it entered a downwind condition, a condition which he didn't anticipate, resulting in a reduced power margin with which to overcome the loss of lift.

On the second touchdown, a flight attendant heard a loud bang in the aft section of the airplane. Post flight inspection revealed damage to the tail skid area on the underside of the airplane.  According to the flight manual, the deployment of the ground spoilers induces a 2 degree pitch up and increases the sink rate of the aircraft, therefore contributing to the higher pitch angle that can result in tail strikes.  In the American Airlines A300 operating manual under touchdown, it states that 'no attempt should be made to hold the airplane off by further increase in attitude.'

The second training flight, flown the previous Saturday, had included single-engine work. The aircraft was observed in the vicinity of the Richland airport by witnesses, several of whom reported the left propeller turning slowly. All witnesses reported seeing the aircraft descending rapidly to the ground in a nose down attitude and several witnesses described the descent as a spin. The aircraft impacted the ground in a near vertical, nose low attitude and was destroyed by fire. Postcrash examination of the aircraft revealed the left propeller in the feathered position and power signatures on the blades of the right propeller. Disassembly of both engines revealed no pre-impact mechanical malfunction. The gear and flaps were up and the rudder trim tab showed about 5 degrees of left tab trim. The information manual for the Cessna 340 indicates that the air minimum control speed (single engine), Vmca is 82 KIAS. The manual also indicates that a more suitable airspeed for one engine inoperative training events is 91 KIAS. ",

Factors contributing to the accident were the pilot-in-command's allowing the left engine to be shut down as well as his allowing the aircraft's airspeed to decelerate below the manufacturer's recommended intentional one-engine inoperative airspeed. A third factor was the aircraft's low altitude at the stall/spin entry which precluded a successful recovery. "

Prior to performing the maneuver, the pilot confirmed with the instructor that once the hydraulic failure warning activated he would accelerate to 40 knots before activating the hydraulic isolation switch. The instructor would need to reset the hydraulic test switch prior to the pilot activating the hydraulic isolation switch. After the briefing, the pilot initiated the maximum performance takeoff, and as the helicopter attained 20-25 feet, the instructor activated the hydraulic test switch. The pilot stated that as soon as the test switch was activated, he could no longer input right pedal because the control forces were too great. The helicopter began to yaw to the left, and the pilot then activated the hydraulic isolation switch because he thought the helicopter would be more controllable. The pilot did not consider that the hydraulic fluid had been evacuated from both the tail rotor accumulator and the yaw load compensator actuator due to the activation of the hydraulic test switch by the instructor, and the test switch had not yet been reset. As a result, the hydraulic boost from the normally closed yaw load compensator system was unavailable. The helicopter continued to yaw to the left and developed into a spin about its vertical axis. The instructor told the pilot to \u201cfly the helicopter\u201d and was hoping the pilot would recover from the loss of control condition. The pilot attempted to recover by following the direction of the nose of the helicopter to try to gain airspeed. The instructor attempted to intercede by inputting right cyclic, but since the pilot was applying left cyclic, the cyclic inputs were ineffective. The helicopter spun around several times before impacting the taxiway. According to the training procedure for a loss of hydraulic pressure, the instructor should have reset the hydraulic test switch prior to the pilot activating the hydraulic isolation switch. This flight manual specific sequence of switch selections and corresponding actions when simulating a hydraulic system failure were not followed by the pilots. Postaccident examination of the helicopter systems, including the hydraulic system, revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.",

The aircraft was substantially damaged, and there were no injuries or ground damage.The aircraft was returning from a flight test in which the airplane was controlled via an over-the-horizon satellite (Iridium) control link.  Approximately 60 seconds prior to the accident, the pilot took over direct control of the aircraft via 72MHz radio control (similar to a model airplane).  On final approach, as the aircraft was commanded low power and nose down pitch, the aircraft lost the 72MHz link, and as programmed the flight control system switched to an autopilot Manual (Assisted) mode.  The Manual (Assisted) mode commanded the aircraft to predefined \u201cfailsafe\u201d settings of 100 knots airspeed and neutral controls, resulting in about 27 degrees of nose up pitch change.  After about one second, the control mode was changed from the failsafe setting to the Home mode, which was inadvertently left latched due to a functionality test earlier in the flight.  The Home mode commanded the airplane to climb toward the home waypoint, which was over the runway, and enter an orbit.

It entered a gradual climb to 2,800 feet, leveled off, and then entered a 2,000-foot-per-minute rate of descent, which was followed by a profusion of primary radar targets around the secondary target.  The wreckage was found within 1/2 mile of the last radar return with signatures consistent with an in-flight breakup.  Several witnesses were found and none saw any adverse weather conditions in the area. One witness said the airplane had been in straight and level flight just prior to the breakup. The airframe was examined by Safety Board engineering and metallurgical specialists. Other than some assembly anomalies unrelated to the breakup, no evidence of any assembly contrary to design plans or material deficiency was found that related to the integrity of wings, stabilizer, or flight control surfaces. No evidence of fatigue, corrosion, or previous damage was found. The separation of the wings and horizontal stabilizer was in a downward direction. All observed fracture surfaces were overload, and no oscillatory loading of the control surfaces was apparent.  Analysis of the radar data revealed that the climb and descent that occurred before the breakup did not require aggressive control inputs. The pitch angle would have changed about 0.4 degrees per second during the climb, and would have decreased about 0.75 degrees per second in the descent, with generated load factors ranging between 1.04 G and 0.88 G. A radar return is only received once every 4.5 seconds and contains uncertainties in both altitude and position measurements. Consequently, the radar may not have detected an abrupt control input that would overload the aircraft structure before the airplane position and altitude changed significantly. While there is no evidence of an abrupt control input or aggressive maneuvering in the available radar data, because of the limitations in the data, the possibility of an abrupt control input cannot be excluded. This airplane is very responsive in pitch control. One of the handling quality characteristics designed by the airplane's manufacturer is that movement of the control stick produces large and rapid changes in pitch attitude.",

The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by the private pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight that departed Cleveland Municipal Airport (6R3), Cleveland, Texas, about 1100, and had the intended destination of Weiser Air Park (EYQ), Houston, Texas.According to the pilot, the airplane wing fuel tanks were topped-off before departing on the accident flight and samples collected from each wing fuel tank were consistent with 100 low-lead aviation fuel and did not contain any water or particulate contamination. The pilot reported that no anomalies were noted during his pretakeoff engine run-up and a normal takeoff was performed. After departure, the pilot overflew the Lake Livingston area, for about 30 minutes, before deciding to turn toward his planned destination (EYQ). While established in cruise flight, at 1,600 feet mean sea level (msl), about 10 miles north of David Wayne Hooks Memorial Airport (DWH), the engine experienced a partial loss of engine power. The pilot reported that the engine \"suddenly began to sputter and lose power.\" The pilot applied carburetor heat, full mixture, and verified that the fuel selector was set on BOTH. The pilot's corrective actions did not restore full engine power; however, he noted that the oil pressure and temperature gauges displayed normal values. He reported that the engine operation was still erratic when he declared an emergency with the DWH tower controller. The flight was cleared for an immediate landing on runway 17; however, shortly after receiving the landing clearance, the engine experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot reported that he trimmed the airplane for best glide airspeed and performed a forced landing to a nearby vacant sports stadium parking lot. The pilot reported that he was unable to stop the airplane before it impacted a concrete curb located at the far end of the parking lot. The impact with the curb collapsed the nose landing gear and the airplane subsequently nosed-over. The fuselage, wings, and empennage were substantially damaged during the forced landing.At 1153, the DWH automated surface observing system reported: wind 230 degrees at 4 knots, few clouds at 3,400 feet above ground level (agl), scattered clouds at 4,100 feet agl, 10 mile surface visibility; temperature 32 degrees Celsius; dew point 24 degrees Celsius; and an altimeter setting of 30.00 inches of mercury.",

He then touched down 800 feet down the runway at 95 to 100 knots. At touchdown, he extended the speed brakes, and, after traveling another 800 feet, he began to apply wheel braking, but the brake pedals felt \u201chard\u201d and would not move. He then attempted to apply the emergency brake, but there was no braking action when he pulled it. The airline transport pilot who was in the right seat and acting as the second-in-command reported also trying to apply wheel braking after the PIC was unsuccessful and stated that it did not work. The airplane then overran the runway into the engineered material arresting system.Review of the radar data for the descent and approach portions of the flight indicated that at times the airplane was fast and the approach was unstabilized. However, the touchdown occurred at a reference speed of 103 to 106 knots. Examination of airport security camera images and deceleration values (determined by using time, distance, and velocity calculations) indicated that the airplane\u2019s deceleration was consistent with a lack of braking. Examination of the normal hydraulic braking system and antiskid system did not reveal any malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the brakes. Examination of the cockpit revealed that the T-handle for the emergency gear extension system had been activated. This handle is located immediately to the right of the emergency braking handle and was most likely pulled during the incident landing instead of the emergency brake handle. Examination of the emergency braking/landing gear blow-down nitrogen bottle revealed that it was empty; no indication of leakage was discovered, and the witness wire on the landing gear blow-down cable at the nitrogen bottle was intact, indicating that the bottle was most likely empty before the incident flight, since adequate nitrogen should have been available from a properly serviced air bottle even if the landing gear had been extended pneumatically.Review of maintenance records that were provided by the operator nonetheless listed the airplane\u2019s most recent inspection as being completed on September 5, 2011, \u201cin accordance with the instructions and procedures of a current manufacturer\u2019s recommended inspection program.\u201d According to a signed inspection document, 13 phase inspections were completed, including a phase 5 inspection containing 126 separate tasks, comprising inspection of the emergency brake control valve, the brake reservoir, the antiskid components, and the antiskid system, as well as replacement of the antiskid motor/pump filter, operational check of the antiskid brake system, operational check of the emergency brake system, replacement of the brake reservoir air filter, and cleaning of the brake reservoir supply line and system filter. The document also indicated that servicing of the \u201cemergency brake and gear Nitrogen\u201d had been accomplished.The landing checklist in the airplane flight manual cautions that if a \u201chard brake pedal-no braking condition\u201d is encountered during landing, the pilot should operate the emergency brake system. It also noted that to obtain maximum braking performance from the antiskid system, the pilot must apply continuous maximum effort (no modulation) to the brake pedals. The Pilot\u2019s Abbreviated Checklist also contains emergency procedures for wheel brake failure and antiskid failure. However, examination of the incident airplane revealed that neither of these documents was in the cockpit. Instead, the cockpit contained a double-sided laminated checklist from a training provider titled \u201cNormal Procedures.\u201d No emergency procedures were printed on the checklist and \u201cFor Training Purposes Only\u201d appeared at the bottom.Based on the available evidence, it could not be determined that a failure of the normal braking system occurred or that the pilots applied maximum braking effort, as indicated by the airplane manufacturer\u2019s guidance. Further, had the braking system actually failed, the pilots did not apply the emergency brakes, instead activating the landing gear extension handle.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilots\u2019 failure to appropriately apply the landing gear wheel brakes after landing, to properly perform the hard brake pedal-no braking condition procedure following the reported brake failure and to apply the emergency brakes.

This was the first flight with this engine installed.  After several successful normal approaches and landings flown at 70 knots, the pilot decided to make a more aggressive STOL (short takeoff and landing) approach. This would require him to fly about 60 knots and required more precise power control.  Shortly after turning from the base leg to final, the propeller went uncommanded into the beta (reverse pitch) range.  At an altitude of 150 feet he didn't think he could lower the nose and attain the 70-knot airspeed he needed to flare normally.  He elected to maintain his three-point attitude and tried to slightly increase power to get the propeller to come out of beta. Normally, beta is obtained by depressing a thumb lever that lifts a pin, allowing the control lever to be moved into the beta range.  He detected no response so he continued to slowly advance the power.  The airplane touched down at approximately 1,000-feet-per-minute rate of descent.  The Federal Aviation Administration accident coordinator examined the airplane, engine, and documentation.  The proper technical manuals were available and the installation appeared to comply with the manuals.  He did not observe any mechanical damage to the controls or linkages that controlled the propeller.  All linkages and jam nuts were secured and the linkages appeared to be properly adjusted. ",
