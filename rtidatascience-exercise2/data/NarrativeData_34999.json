Weather Surveillance Radar data for the area showed a mixture of thunderstorms and rain showers scattered along the planned route of flight.  The aircraft radar track data was plotted on a weather radar image for the corresponding time period.  This composite image showed the last two aircraft beacon returns were 3 to 5 miles northwest of a level-three thunderstorm.  The data indicated that the convective cell was moving toward the northeast and intensifying around the accident time.  Instrument meteorological conditions with light to moderate turbulence were associated with the convective cell.  The accident site was located about 1.5 miles southeast of the last recorded aircraft beacon return.  Examination of the recovered wreckage revealed no evidence of a pre-impact mechanical malfunction.  A review of the airframe, engine and propeller records found no history of unresolved airworthiness issues.  ",

The controller provided the location information and vectors to the requested airport. A review of the ATC communications indicated that the pilot was unsure of his location and was low on fuel. At this point in the flight, the airplane's center of gravity (cg) was calculated to be 2.3 inches aft of the aft cg limit. Generally, as the cg moves aft beyond the aft limit there is an increasing likelihood that the airplane will enter a realm of decreasing pitch stability and have tail-heavy flight characteristics. The pilot attempted to land on a runway with an 80-degree crosswind that was 24 knots gusting to 28 knots. The airplane flew almost sideways down the runway and touched down on the runway several times before climbing back into the air. Surveillance video captured images of the airplane climbing above the runway; between 300 and 400 feet above ground level (agl) it made a right-hand turn, then plummeted vertically and impacted the ground. The sudden change from a 24-knot left crosswind to a 24-knot tailwind during the pilot\u2019s execution of the right-hand turn towards the downwind leg of the landing pattern, combined with some pitch sensitivity due to the cg location, most likely induced an aerodynamic stall and subsequent loss of lift that was not anticipated nor compensated for by the pilot.

About 7 miles from the departure airport, the pilot reversed course and notified the air traffic controller that he was declaring an emergency. As the pilot was proceeding back toward the departure airport witnesses observed fire beneath, and smoke trailing from, the right engine and heard boom sounds or explosions as the airplane descended. Although the pilot feathered the right engine's propeller, the airplane's descent continued. The 12-minute flight ended about 1.25 miles from the runway when the airplane impacted trees and power lines before coming to rest upside down adjacent to a private residence. A fuel-fed fire consumed the airframe and damaged nearby private residences.  The airplane was owned and operated by an airplane broker that intended to have it ferried to Korea. In preparation for the overseas ferry flight, the airplane's engines were overhauled. Maintenance was also performed on various components including the engine-driven fuel pumps, turbochargers, and propellers. Nacelle fuel tanks were installed and the airplane received an annual inspection. Thereafter, the broker had a ferry pilot fly the airplane from the maintenance facility in Ohio to the pilot's Nevada-based facility, where the ferry pilot had additional maintenance performed related to the air conditioner, gear door, vacuum pump, and idle adjustment. Upon completion of this maintenance, the right engine was test run for at least 20 minutes and the airplane was returned to the ferry pilot. During the following month, the ferry pilot modified the airplane's fuel system by installing four custom-made ferry fuel tanks in the fuselage, and associated plumbing in the wings, to supplement the existing six certificated fuel tanks. The ferry pilot held an airframe and powerplant mechanic certificate with inspection authorization. He reinspected the airplane, purportedly in accordance with the Piper Aircraft Company's annual inspection protocol, signed the maintenance logbook, and requested Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval for his ferry flight. The FAA reported that it did not process the first ferry pilot's ferry permit application because of issues related to the applicant's forms and the FAA inspector's workload. The airplane broker discharged the pilot and contracted with a new ferry pilot (the accident pilot) to immediately pick up the airplane in Nevada and fly it to California, the second ferry pilot's base. The contract specified that the airplane be airworthy. In California, the accident pilot planned to complete any necessary modifications, acquire FAA approval, and then ferry the airplane overseas. The discharged ferry pilot stated to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator that none of his airplane modifications had involved maintenance in the right engine compartment. He also stated that when he presented the airplane to the replacement ferry pilot (at most 3 hours before takeoff) he told him that fuel lines and fittings in the wings related to the ferry tanks needed to be disconnected prior to flight. During the Safety Board's examination of the airplane, physical evidence was found indicating that the custom-made ferry tank plumbing in the wings had not been disconnected. The airplane wreckage was examined by the NTSB investigation team while on scene and following its recovery. Regarding both engines, no evidence was found of any internal engine component malfunction. Notably, the localized area surrounding and including the right engine-driven fuel pump and its outlet port had sustained significantly greater fire damage than was observed elsewhere. According to the Lycoming engine participant, the damage was consistent with a fuel-fed fire originating in this vicinity, which may have resulted from the engine's fuel supply line \"B\" nut being loose, a failed fuel line, or an engine-driven fuel pump-related leak. The fuel supply line and its connecting components were not located. The engine-driven fuel pump was subsequently examined by staff from the NTSB's Materials Laboratory. Noted evidence consisted of globules of resolidified metal and areas of missing material consistent with the pump having been engulfed in fire. The staff also examined the airplane. Evidence was found indicating that the fire's area of origin was not within the wings or fuselage, but rather emanated from a localized area within the right engine compartment, where the engine-driven fuel pump and its fuel supply line and fittings were located. However, due to the extensive pre- and post-impact fires, the point of origin and the initiating event that precipitated the fuel leak could not be ascertained.The airplane's \"Pilot Operator's Handbook\" (POH), provides the procedures for responding to an in-flight fire and securing an engine. It also provides single-engine climb performance data. The POH indicates that the pilot should move the firewall fuel shutoff valve of the affected engine to the \"off\" position, feather the propeller, close the engine's cowl flaps to reduce drag, turn off the magneto switches, turn off the emergency fuel pump switch and the fuel selector, and pull out the fuel boost pump circuit breaker. It further notes that unless the boost pump's circuit breaker is pulled, the pump will continuously operate. During the wreckage examination, the Safety Board investigators found evidence indicating that the right engine's propeller was feathered. However, contrary to the POH's guidance, the right engine's firewall fuel shutoff valve was not in the \"off\" position, the cowl flaps were open, the magneto switches were on, the emergency fuel pump switches and the fuel selector were on, and the landing gear was down. Due to fire damage, the position of the fuel boost pump circuit breaker could not be ascertained.  Calculations based upon POH data indicate that an undamaged and appropriately configured airplane flying on one engine should have had the capability to climb between 100 and 200 feet per minute and, at a minimum, maintain altitude. Recorded Mode C altitude data indicates that during the last 5 minutes of flight, the airplane descended while slowing about 16 knots below the speed required to maintain altitude.",
            "probable_cause": "A loss of power in the right engine due to an in-flight fuel-fed fire in the right engine compartment that, while the exact origin could not be determined, was likely related to the right engine-driven fuel pump, its fuel supply line, or fitting. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to adhere to the POH's procedures for responding to the fire and configuring the airplane to reduce aerodynamic drag."

Beyond the power line and road was a large area of open desert where the pilot planned to land. When the balloon was about 100 yards from the lines at an altitude of about 300 feet above ground level, the pilot began setting the balloon up for landing by cracking open the vent-top of the envelope. The pilot operated one of the two burners to compensate for the expected loss of lift from the partly open top; however, the balloon began a slow descent instead of maintaining altitude, and the descent rate seemed to accelerate. In response, the pilot operated both burners and looked up at the top of the balloon, which he found was over a third open instead of the expected 2- to 3-foot crack. Realizing that the balloon\u2019s glidepath would now result in the basket impacting the upper wire of the power line, the pilot decided to fully open the top of the balloon and land short of the power line. The balloon descended and impacted the power line wires with the basket suspension cables contacting more than one wire, which resulted in electrical arcing.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.Four days before the accident flight, the accident helicopter experienced an intermittent loss of power to the No. 2 engine that lasted about 10 to 20 seconds while it was in cruise flight. The pilot described the event as a \"rollback\" but was uncertain as to how much power the engine actually lost during the event. He reported that the No. 2 engine reestablished power by itself. When he arrived at his destination, he shut down the helicopter and checked for any fault codes generated by the electronic engine control (EEC) units. No faults were recorded. He then performed ground and hover checks, and the helicopter appeared to be operating normally. He continued to fly and completed another two flights to oil platforms that same day. The next day the pilot flew another three flights without incident. A mechanic checked for fault codes, but none were recorded. The helicopter was released for flight with no further ground or flight checks. Because the pilot continued to fly the helicopter without determining the reason for the intermittent loss of engine power, the risk of another engine power loss remained high.On the day of the accident, the pilot departed for an oil platform with six passengers and full fuel. The postaccident calculated takeoff weight was about 515 pounds over the maximum gross weight. The postaccident calculated weight of the helicopter during the approach to the oil platform was about 55 pounds below the maximum gross weight. Although the helicopter was within weight limits during the approach, its higher gross weight as compared to what it would have weighed if the pilot had loaded it within limits for the departure decreased its performance capability. The closest surface weather station, located 21 miles away, indicated that the wind was from 070 degrees at 5 knots at the time of the accident, but the pilot believed his last GPS reading of the wind was from 220 degrees at 5 to 6 knots. The pilot flew a visual approach to the oil platform on a 190-degree heading, which limited the go-around potential since it was on a direct course for the oil platform's super structure. The pilot reported that the helicopter was about 60 feet from and 15 to 20 feet above the landing pad with a nose-high attitude in the flare when there was a loss of engine power. The pilot was unsure which engine had the loss of power. With the loss of power, the pilot realized that the trajectory of the helicopter placed it short of the landing pad and that the helicopter was going to hit the platform. He pulled collective pitch and moved the cyclic control aft and to the left to clear the platform. Once clear of the platform, he attempted to lower the collective and gain airspeed, but the helicopter was in a high rate of descent with low airspeed. He pulled collective pitch and flared the helicopter before water impact. The pilot reported that it was about 3 to 4 seconds from the time he maneuvered to avoid hitting the platform to water impact. The helicopter remained on top of the surface as the pilot kept power on the helicopter to keep it from sinking. He deployed the emergency floatation bags and attempted to water taxi toward the oil platform, but there was no directional control since the tail boom was partially separated from the fuselage. All personnel were rescued without injury.The examination of the wreckage revealed an anomaly within the stepper motor for the No. 2 engine's fuel control. The examination revealed that the end of the output shaft of the stepper motor had overstress fractures and that the shaft was bent. During the overhaul of the stepper motor 8 years before the accident, the pin that attaches the flapper valve lever to the output shaft was pressed onto the output shaft. The force applied to the external lever was sufficient to both crack and bend the output shaft. This condition eventually resulted in a \"stuck\" stepper motor which limited the fuel flow to the engine and resulted in an intermittent loss of engine power. The EECs did not monitor the performance of the output shaft or the flapper valve lever; therefore, no fault codes were generated by the EECs.",
            "probable_cause": "The intermittent loss of engine power due to a \"stuck\" stepper motor in the No. 2 engine's fuel control as a result of an inadequate overhaul. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to continue flying the helicopter with a known defect, his decision to depart with the helicopter over its maximum gross weight, and his decision to fly the approach to the oil platform at a high gross weight in a direction that provided limited go-around potential."

He was able to hover-taxi about five feet above the terrain for about 50 yards, but when the helicopter began to yaw, he made the decision to attempt to land.

Shortly thereafter, he noticed smoke blowing past the right side of the helicopter. He said that as he attempted to maneuver the helicopter away from the smoke, the engine lost power, and the rotor speed decayed. He landed in the grass, which was on fire, and exited the helicopter, which sustained substantial thermal damage forward of the tailboom. A postaccident examination revealed that the engine exhaust had ignited the grass. According to the operator, the accident location was not an approved landing site.

The Beech flight departed VFR, and the pilot attempted to obtain an IFR clearance, but the controller advised him that there was no IFR flight plan in the system. The pilot advised the controller that he would proceed VFR. While en route, the Beech was on a north-northwesterly course, when it began to converge with Piper PA-32, N3940W, that was on a east-northeasterly course at about the same altitude. At about that time, the Beech pilot contacted an ATC facility and stated that his flight was level at 5,500 feet. He was given a discrete transponder code to squawk, and the pilot complied. The controller immediately advised the pilot that traffic was off to his left, but there was no acknowledgement. Both airplanes crashed into a rural area. An investigation revealed the nose landing gear of the Piper collided with the left wing tip of the Beech. Review of the FAR's revealed that while flying VFR between 180 and 359 degrees magnetic course, above 3,000 feet above ground level (agl), the pilot should fly at even thousand feet altitudes plus 500 feet.

Approximately 30 minutes after the accident, another helicopter arrived and dropped an emergency life raft into the water for the pilot and crew until further assistance could arrive.  A brief examination of the helicopter by the pilot after evacuation revealed that the tailboom was separated from the fuselage.  Recovery efforts were initiated on November 6, 2004.  During the recovery process, the skids of the helicopter separated from the fuselage and the helicopter sank.

One witness reported that the gyrocopter's nose was pushed up after it was struck by a gust of wind.  He watched as the pilot corrected the pitch attitude by pushing the nose down.  He then saw the gyrocopter tilting back and forth.  A friend of the pilot, who is also the gyrocopter kit manufacturer, reported that he and the pilot had performed a pitch change adjustment to the main rotor system that was about 1/4 inch out of track. After the adjustment was made, the friend test flew the gyrocopter with no problems encountered.  The gyrocopter was constructed of a tandem seat configuration fuselage with tricycle landing gear, a two-bladed teetering main rotor system, a rear mounted engine with a three-bladed propeller assembly, followed by a rudder, and vertical and horizontal stabilizers.  An inspection of the gyrocopter by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector and the gyrocopter kit manufacturer revealed that only about 5 percent of the wooden three-bladed propeller remained affixed to the propeller hub.  Reconstruction of the recovered propeller material found that one of the propeller blades had a deep concave deformity at the leading edge approximately 10 inches from the root.  No evidence of propeller blade or main rotor blade to airframe contact was found, and the investigation could not explain the origin of the propeller blade defect nor its relationship to the accident's causation, if any.  Toxicological tests revealed the presence in the blood of zolpidem (a prescription sleep aid) at a level consistent with very recent use, and very high blood levels of hydrocodone (a prescription narcotic painkiller), and diphenhydramine (an over-the-counter antihistamine).  All three medications would have been expected to result in impairment of judgment and psychomotor skills.  The pilot's ability to operate the gyrocopter with the levels of substances found suggests a substantial tolerance to their sedative effects, implying a long-term use of high doses.

A postaccident examination of the two-cylinder engine revealed excessive piston scoring within one of the cylinder assemblies and excessive wear on the piston wrist-pin. The observed anomalies were consistent with a cold-seizure event. A cold-seizure event is a thermo-imbalance condition between the piston and cylinder, which results in an insufficient clearance between the piston and the cylinder. The cylinder thermo-imbalance condition is typically the result of an insufficient engine warm-up period before takeoff power is applied. However, the conditions that led to the cold-seizure event may not have been limited to the accident flight. The total loss of engine power during initial climb, while towing a hang glider, likely contributed to the aerodynamic stall/spin encountered at a low altitude.

The pilot attempted to return to the airport for a precautionary landing.  During the turn back to the airport, the engine began to run rough.  The pilot was unable to make the runway and made an off-airport emergency landing and collided with ground obstructions.  A post-accident investigation revealed an oil starvation failure of the engine.  The oil pump's drive gear shaft had failed in torsional overload.  Examination of the oil pump's driven gear revealed that the required bronze bushings between it and the driven gear shaft were absent.  It was noted that the engine was overhauled 162 hours prior to the accident.  During the engine overhaul, the oil pump was sent out for overhaul and was returned to the owner as a disassembled unit.  The owner/pilot, who was not a certified A & P mechanic, reassembled the oil pump and reinstalled it on the airplane.  A certified A & P mechanic reported that he did sign the logbook to this affect, but he did not monitor or inspect the work that had been completed by the owner. ",

After lift off, the pilot knew something was wrong and told the tower he was going to make a right turn to downwind and return for landing. After landing, the pilot noticed that the left wing and left propeller were damaged and that the pitot tube cover was still installed on the pitot tube. The estimated takeoff weight of the aircraft was about 5,100 pounds.  The manufacturer's published airspeed for lift off at 5,500 pounds gross weight is 89 knots. The measured cloud cover (ceiling) at the time of the accident was 100 feet overcast with 1 mile visibility ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to perform an adequate preflight (did not remove pitot tube protective covering prior to flight) which resulted in an inaccurate cockpit airspeed indication during takeoff roll and subsequent emergency landing. Factors were, the pilot's diverted attention while performing his preflight (loose animal on the ramp), the pilot's failure to abort the takeoff after noticing an airspeed anomaly during takeoff roll, and the low ceiling (100 feet overcast) the pilot encountered after lift off and while returning to land.

The certificated commercial pilot and two passengers were not injured. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed.During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on April 13, 2015, the pilot stated that prior to the flight from Bettles to the unimproved ski strip, 15 total gallons of 100LL fuel were added to the fuel tanks. The flight from Bettles to the ski strip lasted approximately .2 hours, leaving about 12 gallons of fuel for the return flight. Shortly after takeoff for the flight to Bettles, between about 50 and 70 feet above ground level (AGL), a total loss of engine power occurred. After completing the emergency procedures for an engine failure, the pilot lowered the nose of the airplane to find a suitable landing area. When he determined he was unable to reach the desired landing point, he arrested the descent and settled into the brush along the side of a river, sustaining substantial damage to the airplane. The closest weather reporting facility is Bettles Airport, Bettles, Alaska, approximately 20 miles south of the accident site. At 1553, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) from the Bettles Airport was reporting in part: wind from 150 degrees at 3 knots; sky condition, scattered at 3,000 feet AGL, broken at 5,500 feet AGL; visibility, 10 statute miles; temperature 19 degrees F; dewpoint 10 degrees F; barometric pressure 29.53inHG.

He had just turned on the fasten seatbelt sign when they received a resolution advisory (RA) from the onboard traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS). The captain then took back control of the airplane and initiated an avoidance maneuver. During the avoidance maneuver, a flight attendant sustained serious injuries and a child passenger sustained a minor injury. Review of air traffic control radar data and data from the onboard flight data recorder revealed that 1.5 seconds after the TCAS RA occurred, the captain initiated a series of excessive control inputs which resulted in a positive vertical acceleration of approximately 1.6g. One second after the positive vertical acceleration the airplane sustained a maximum negative vertical acceleration of approximately .2g. A second after the negative vertical acceleration the airplane sustained another positive load of 1.4g after which the acceleration was dampened out. According to the TCAS manufacturer's published guidance, a flight crew should \"promptly but smoothly\" follow a TCAS RA and since the maneuvers are coordinated between aircraft, the crew should never maneuver in the opposite direction of the advisory. The advisories are always based on the \"least amount of deviation from the flight path\" while providing safe vertical separation. Typical RAs that would require a maneuver by a flightcrew only requires crew response within 5 seconds and g-forces of \u00b1.25g.

Metallurgical examination identified a fatigue fracture primarily on the exhaust side of the cylinder head, perpendicular to the axis of the barrel.

About 20 seconds later, the captain, who was the pilot flying, moved the No. 1 throttle to idle and asked the first officer to declare an emergency with air traffic control. About 47 seconds after the first officer identified the No. 1 engine fire warning, the captain asked the first officer to perform the engine fire emergency procedures checklist. The engine fire warning system deactivated because of fire damage to one of the fire loops, about 88 seconds after the fire warning activated and 2 seconds before the first officer moved the No. 1 fuel lever to the off position, shutting down the No. 1 engine. The flight crew did not notice the warning that the No. 1 fire loop system was inoperative.  The engine fire warning system uses two loops.  If one loop should no longer sense a fire or become inoperative because of fire damage, the engine fire warning will deactivate and a fire loop warning will be displayed to the flight crew. The flight crew must deactivate the faulty loop to regain the engine fire warning.  The crew elected to stop the procedure after shutting down the No.1 engine because the fire light went out, and therefore did not activate the No.1 fire handle.  Pressurized fuel continued to be supplied to the engine and feed the engine fire. The flight crew turned back to the departure airport.  At 2,000 feet, about 3 minutes from landing, a flight attendant reported that a mechanic in the back had stated that the No. 1 engine was still smoking or on fire. The flight crew did not take any action and landed. About 1 minute after stopping, the captain ordered an emergency evacuation of the airplane, with instructions not to use the left overwing exits. About 1 minute 55 seconds after landing, the flight crew pulled the engine and auxiliary power unit fire handles and discharged the fire bottles into the No. 1 engine.  In 1995, Airbus changed the engine fire procedure to allow for discontinuing the fire procedure and keeping an engine running at idle after an engine fire warning once the fire warning has gone out and after the throttle has been moved to idle. This change was made because of the high number of bleed air leak activated fire warnings.  Postincident examination of the No. 1 engine showed that all the accessory gearbox idler adapter attachment bolt inserts had backed out, allowing fuel lines to unseat and spray pressurized fuel onto hot engine parts and ignite. On September 26, 1995, the accessory gear box idler adapter had been reworked per General Electric Aircraft Engine Service Bulletin 72-743 during engine overhaul at a vendor's facility.

Contributing to the severity of the incident were (1) the flight crew's failure immediately to complete the in-flight engine fire procedures and (2) the failure of Airbus Industrie and American Airlines to provide all necessary information in the in-flight engine fire procedures.

According to company policy, airplanes departing Concourse A were pushed back until the main landing gear wheels sat on the centerline of Taxiway AS, the northern taxiway.  This policy assured airplanes taxiing on Taxiway AA (the southern taxiway) adequate wingtip clearance (about 30 feet), assuming their nose wheel stayed on the centerline.  A witness said the holding airplane was pushed back too far from Taxiway AS and the taxiing airplane's nose wheel was on the centerline of Taxiway AA.  As the inbound airplane taxied behind the holding airplane, its left winglet cut through the bottom section of holding airplane's tail cone.  The flight crew on the inbound airplane recognized that the holding airplane was pushed back further than normal from the gate and elected to increase their wing tip clearance by moving to the right of the Taxiway AA centerline approximately 5 to 6 feet.  As they approached the holding airplane, the captain reduced forward speed to a crawl, determined there was sufficient clearance between the two airplanes, and continued to taxi to their assigned gate.

Radar data showed that the airplane steadily descended through 8,000 feet during the last 4 minutes of the flight.  The airplane impacted the side of the mountain at the 6,970 foot elevation with low energy, in a very steep left turn; left wing down.  Analysis of the weather conditions established that mountain wave conditions existed at 9,000 feet with a wavelength of 2.79 miles, amplitude of 717 feet, and a maximum vertical velocity of 1,185 fpm.  This wave had a potential for moderate to severe turbulence.  There is no record that the pilot requested or received a weather briefing.  At the cruise altitude of the airplane, the performance charts show that it had a maximum climb capability of about 400 feet per minute.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilots inadequate preflight planning and intentional flight into known adverse weather conditions.  Contributing to this accident was the fact that it was a dark night with no moon illumination."

The AD noted that compliance was required in order \"to prevent failure of a tailboom support strut or lug on a cluster fitting.\"  The AD required modification or replacement of the original cluster fittings, part numbers 269A2234 and 269A2235, within 6 months or 150 hours time-in-service (TIS).  The AD required dye penetrant inspections of the lugs within 10 hours TIS, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS, until the lugs were modified or replaced.  Nominal measured lug thickness was 0.076 inch, which was consistent with the original cluster fitting configuration.  The failed lug did not appear to have been modified and did not appear to be in compliance with the AD.  Review of the aircraft logbook revealed that a 100 hour / annual inspection was completed on May 23, 2005.  The inspection entry noted AD 2003-13-15 R1.  In addition, the airworthiness compliance record noted that the AD had been complied with by performing a dye penetrant inspection without finding any cracks.  The entry also stated that the modification kit was not installed at that time.",

The flight departed Honolulu VFR at 0032 to pickup a patient in Hilo, on the Island of Hawaii.  The inter island cruising altitude was 9,500 feet and the flight was obtaining VFR flight advisories.  At 0113, just before the flight crossed the northwestern coast of Hawaii, the controller provided the pilot with the current Hilo weather, which was reporting a visibility of 1 3/4 miles in heavy rain and mist with ceiling 1,700 feet broken, 2,300 overcast.  Recorded radar data showed that the flight crossed the coast of Hawaii at 0122, descending through 7,400 feet tracking southeast bound toward the northern slopes of Mauna Kea and Hilo beyond.  The last recorded position of the aircraft was about 26 miles northwest of the accident site at a mode C reported altitude of 6,400 feet.  At 0130, the controller informed the pilot that radar contact was lost and also said that at the airplane's altitude, radar coverage would not be available inbound to Hilo. The controller terminated radar services.  A witness who lived in the immediate area of the accident site reported that around 0130 he heard a low-flying airplane coming from the north.  He walked outside his residence and observed an airplane fly over about 500 feet above ground level (agl) traveling in the direction of the accident site about 3 miles east.  The witness said that light rain was falling and he could see a half moon, which he thought provided fair illumination.  The area forecast in effect at the time of the flight's departure called for broken to overcast layers from 1,000 to 2,000 feet, with merging layers to 30,000 feet and isolated cumulonimbus clouds with tops to 40,000 feet.  It also indicated that the visibility could temporarily go below 3 statute miles.  The debris path extended about 500 feet along a magnetic bearing of 100 degrees with debris scattered both on the ground and in tree branches.  Investigators found no anomalies with the airplane or engines that would have precluded normal operation.  Pilots for the operator typically departed under VFR, even in night conditions or with expectations of encountering adverse weather, to preclude ground holding delays.  The pilots would then pickup their instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance en route.  The forecast and actual weather conditions at Hilo were below the minimums specified in the company Operations Manual for VFR operations.",

A contributing factor was the pilot's failure to adhere to the VFR weather minimum procedures in the company's Operations Manual."

The airline transport pilot and the passenger/owner were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight departed Monroe-Walton County Airport (D73), Monroe, Georgia, about 1735.In a written statement, the pilot said the accident flight was a return flight from D73 after he had performed glider-tow flights in another airplane there. While on final approach for landing to runway 36, the pilot detected a tailwind, and visually confirmed his suspicion by smoke trails off small fires nearby. He elected to go around, and return for a landing on runway 18.The pilot stated his approach speed was 80 to 85 miles per hour, and that he slipped the airplane to a firm landing in order to begin braking \"as soon as possible\" on the turf runway which was 2,000 feet long. The pilot felt no \"pressure\" or braking action when he actuated the brake handle. Pressure in the system built as he pumped the brake handle, and braking action was restored when 300 feet of the runway remained. The airplane departed the departure end of the runway, traveled down an embankment, nosed over, and came to rest inverted. The pilot stated that he elected not to abort the landing because of the obstacles and a water treatment plant off the departure end of runway 18.Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed \"no pressure\" when the brake handle was actuated, but that brake pressure would build if the handle was pumped.The pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rating for airplane multi-engine land, and a commercial pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land. He reported 28,500 total hours of flight experience, of which 250 hours were in the accident airplane make and model. His most recent FAA second class medical certificate was issued in March 2015.The airplane was manufactured in 1964 and was equipped with hand-actuated brakes only.

The student was at the controls during the takeoff roll and, as the airplane rotated, the nose lifted at an angle that the CFI determined was excessive. He verbally coached the student to lower the nose, but the nose did not lower. He again requested that the student lower the nose, but he did not respond. The airplane then began to drift to the left, so the CFI took the controls. The CFI attempted to regain control of the airplane; however, the wing dropped and the airplane landed hard. The airplane departed the runway and was consumed by a postimpact fire after coming to rest on a taxiway. The CFI reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. Examination of the flap actuator mechanism revealed that the flaps were fully extended at the time of the accident, rather than set to the mid-range takeoff position. The extended flap position likely resulted in the excessive nose-up tendencies experienced during the takeoff roll.",
            "probable_cause": "The student pilot's failure to properly position the flaps for the takeoff, failure to maintain airplane control during the procedure, and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action."

According to the deputy's report, a rotor blade was found about 150 feet north of the point of impact, and other debris was strewn to the southwest. The co-builder of the accident gyroplane, who was also a close friend of the pilot, contacted three gyroplane experts: the designer of the SA-1 Dominator and President of Rotor Flight Dynamics; a gyroplane aerodynamist; and the designer of another gyroplane.  They examined the wreckage and compiled both a factual and analytical report. The following is based on the factual portion of the report. The separated rotor blade was bowed upward and had fractured about 2 feet from the tip. The fracture was consistent with positive overload. There was orange paint and primer transfer marks on the top and upper leading edge (the tail cone was painted orange). The attached rotor blade was also bent upward. The propeller blades exhibited no strike marks. The rotor head and hub bar were intact. The hub bar, normally bent 2.5 degrees upward, was bent approximately 10 degrees upward. The roll pillow blocks bore evidence of hammering and were mushroomed. The pitch stops were similarly damaged. In the analytical portion of the report, the necessity of maintaining blade loading at all times in order to maintain main rotor blade rotation was noted. The fracture on the separated main rotor blade was in \"a purely upward bending moment which could only have occurred if the blade rpm had dramatically slowed...If totally unloaded, the blade rpm can deteriorate as fast as 120 rpm/sec.\" Normal rotor blade rpm is 320 to 400 rpm. If rotor blade rpm were allowed to drop, increasing the velocity of air moving through the rotor system, severe blade \"flapping\" would result as evidenced by the pounding and mushrooming of the roll pillow blocks and bending of the hub bar on the rotor head. A toxicological test revealed 2.024 (ug/mL, ug/g) paroxetine in the blood and liver. The drug is an antidepressant and contraindicated for flight.  The pilot's personal physician prescribed the drug for the treatment of fibromyalgia, a condition manifested by muscle soreness. Adverse effects of the drug include drowsiness, muscle weakness, agitation, and tremors.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to maintain main rotor rpm, resulting in blade flapping, subsequent blade contact with the airframe, and loss of control."
