An individual who owns a Cessna 337 heard both engines operating at what he thought was full power.  The airplane impacted on the runway surface and was destroyed by impact and the postcrash fire.  According to a witness, the pilot started the engines and taxied to utilize all available runway.  The flight was cleared to takeoff, and according to a controller in the tower cab, he did not observe the point of rotation, but reported the airplane was in a normal climb attitude when the flight was airborne approximately 1,000 feet down the runway, when it was approximately 500 feet more down the length of the runway, he observed the airplane pitch up to between an estimated 30-45 degrees, then level off at an estimated altitude of between 150-200 feet above ground level.  Approximately 5 seconds later, the wings were noted to rock up and down and the airplane drifted north of the runway.  The airplane rolled nose and left wing low, then appeared to level off before impacting the ground while in a slight nose up and left wing low attitude.  He did not hear any unusual engine sounds during the flight and could not determine if the engines were run-up before departure. Both engines' rpm sounded to be synchronized during the flight.  There was no distress call made by the pilot.  The owner recently purchased the airplane and had a pre-buy inspection of it; no discrepancies were noted related to the flight controls.  The airplane was flown from the place where purchased (California), to Florida, and was delivered 2 days before the accident.  The pilot who flew the airplane to Florida reported it was a \"fairly flawless trip.\"  He did report that the autopilot was inoperative, and the digital fuel flow meter was inoperative.  No repairs were performed to correct the inoperative autopilot before the accident flight.  The accident pilot flew the airplane on 3 separate flights earlier on the day of the accident, and during the takeoff of all 3 flights, a pilot rated passenger later reported that the airplane pitched up aggressively during rotation.  The passenger looked at the elevator trim setting and noted it was in the correct range for takeoff.  During the landing of the third leg, the accident pilot reportedly performed a full stall landing from a height of 10 feet.  The airplane was then taxied to the ramp and both fuel tanks were topped off for the accident flight.  No maintenance was performed to the elevator primary or secondary flight control systems as a result of the reported excessive pitch-up events.  Examination of the primary and secondary flight control system of the airplane revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction of the cables.  The elevator trim was found set to 4 to 5 degrees aircraft nose-down.  The flaps were extended 10 degrees, and the landing gear was extended at impact.  Examination of the front and rear engines propeller and propeller governors revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of the pilot's seat tracks revealed both exhibited evidence of lock pin engagement at the time of impact in the 9th hole from the front.  The airplane was calculated to be within weight and balance limits at the time of the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's operation of the airplane with known deficiencies in equipment related to pitch, an abrupt pitch-up during the initial climb after takeoff for undetermined reasons and the failure of the pilot to maintain airspeed (Vs) resulting in inadvertent stall, uncontrolled descent, and in-flight collision with terrain."

The fracture surface appeared to be a fatigue failure. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed about 9 months prior to the accident, with no anomalies noted.

Ground scar analysis and crush angle measurements on the airplane disclosed that it descended in a near vertical nose down attitude to impact on the glacier.

According to fuel records and the pilot's statement, it is likely that the airplane had a total of about 23 gallons of fuel on board at the last refueling; however, 6 gallons of the fuel were in the top tank and used during taxi and run-up operations. Therefore, considering the airplane's lowest fuel consumption rate of about 7.2 gallons per hour, the airplane would have been able to operate for 3.2 total hours. At the time of the accident, it had flown a total of 3.3 flight hours. Therefore, the pilot began the flight with an insufficient amount of fuel and did not monitor its quantity during the flight.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate preflight planning and failure to monitor the fuel quantity during flight, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion."

The witness said that the airplane then banked left and descended in a spiral until it impacted the ground. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed evidence of abnormal piston wear and cylinder damage, including mechanical scoring and vertical grooves along the forward cylinder walls and piston skirt. A representative of the engine manufacturer reported that the observed cylinder and piston damage was consistent with an in-flight cold seizure of the piston (a condition where the piston seizes within the cylinder). About 17 years before the accident, the engine manufacturer issued a Service Information Letter (SIL) that addressed the potential for such a piston seizure. The SIL stated in part \u201c...Putting a cold engine to hard work without uniform and correct warm up will cause the piston to expand quicker than the cylinder, minimizing clearance and creating piston scuffing and seizure.\u201d It is likely that the pilot did not allow enough time for the engine to warm up before taking off.",

The CFI reported that the right engine \"came almost completely apart and off in a matter of two seconds.\"  The right engine was canted and hanging down, and altitude could not be maintained.  The CFI maintained sufficient airspeed to maintain control during the descent, but he elected to do a forced landing to a field as a result of the loss of altitude.  The airplane impacted the side of a creek during the forced landing, and ended right side up in about three feet of water in a creek.  The Hartzell two bladed propeller hub and other components from the propeller assembly were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Materials Laboratory for examination.  The hub from the right engine of the airplane was a left hand rotating (counterclockwise viewed from the rear) propeller.  The inspection revealed that the hub was fractured around the socket for blade #1 (designated by serial number location) through both the forward and aft halves of the hub.  The fracture surface contained features consistent with fatigue crack progression generally away from the grease fitting hole.  The entire fatigue region measured about 3.1 inches in length from the grease fitting hole to near the forward centerline of the blade socket.

While in the landing pattern, the student and CFI heard a \"bang.\"  The CFI took the flight controls, initiated an autorotation, and turned to an open area for an emergency landing.  During the autorotation the CFI noticed a loss of his ability to maintain directional control.  He lowered the collective and continued with the autorotation.  As he pulled collective to cushion the landing the helicopter yawed to the left, landed firmly on the ground, and rolled over on to its right side.  The CFI's execution of an autorotative landing failed to adjust for the engagement of the engine when he pulled in collective to cushion the landing.  Engagement of engine power in the autorotative flare caused the helicopter to yaw left, which was not compensated for by the failed tail rotor.  The helicopter encountered ground resistance when it landed, and the force of the uncontrolled left yaw rolled it over onto its right side.  The FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook describes the appropriate response to an antitorque failure as an entry into an autorotation profile by reducing the collective and rolling off the throttle.  Rolling off the throttle will prevent the engine from engaging during the autorotative landing.  The manufacturer's flight manual does not address the issue of performing an autorotative landing with a tail rotor failure.  Examination of the helicopter revealed that the secondary drive shaft appeared to have fractured between the lower bearing and the lock collar.  Examination of the shaft revealed fretting and corrosion in the area contacted by the lock collar.  The fracture was a result of fatigue cracking that initiated in the area of fretting and corrosion.  This secondary drive shaft had been involved in one helicopter rollover and two tail rotor strikes.  It is possible that excessive loads generated during these previous events was sufficient to loosen the lower bearing on the shaft and initiate the fretting and corrosion process that eventually led to the initiation of a fatigue crack.

After unsuccessfully attempting to raise the landing gear manually, the flight crew elected to return to the airport. During the landing flare, the ground spoilers deployed when the throttles were brought to idle. The airplane descended rapidly and landed hard, and the right main landing gear collapsed. The investigation determined that a mechanic had wedged wooden sticks into the airplane's weight-on-wheels (WOW) switches to force them into the ground mode while the airplane was on jacks during maintenance. The mechanic said that he used the sticks to disable the WOW switches to gain access to the maintenance data acquisition unit, which was necessary to troubleshoot an overspeed alert discrepancy. After the maintenance was performed, the sticks were not removed, and the airplane was returned to service. No notation about the disabled WOW switches was entered in the work logs.

Ground spoilers will deploy when the throttles are brought to idle if the spoilers are armed and the WOW switches are in the ground mode. The G-V Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) cautions flight crews not to move thrust reverser levers and to switch the GND SPOILER armed to off following an amber WOW FAULT message.

The pilot had recently received his private pilot's certificate and did not possess an instrument rating.  AIRMET's were issued for turbulence, icing, and mountain obscuration in the vicinity of the pilot's route of flight for the period between 1845 and 0100 Pacific time. There is no record that the pilot requested or received a weather briefing.  Radar data and ATC communications tapes shows the airplane left the departure airport at 1939, and eventually took a northerly heading toward the mountains that separate the coastal plain from an inland valley.  It paralleled an interstate highway, and leveled off at 9,500 feet.  Over the last mountain pass before entering the inland valley (elevation: 4,239 feet), the airplane diverted to the west, and climbed to 10,000 feet.  The pilot checked in with ATC at 10,000 feet and requested visual flight rules  (VFR) flight following and an altitude of 10,500 feet.  The elevation of the mountainous terrain to the west of the pass ranges from 5,000 feet in the valley to mountain peaks and ridges between 7,000 feet and 8,840 feet to the north and south.  The pilot confirmed with ATC that he was diverting to the west for cloud avoidance.  The pilot then requested a descent to 8,500 feet.  ATC approved the descent at the pilot discretion and advised him to maintain VFR.  As the airplane proceeded west, radar recorded the altitude decreasing through 9,000 feet at a rate of descent of 1,100 feet per minute.  The pilot continued his descent and requested 4,500 feet.  ATC advised the pilot that he was in the vicinity of high terrain.  The pilot said he could see the ground but he didn't have good (forward) visibility and requested a vector (to clearer weather).  ATC advised him to adjust his heading northbound towards lower terrain, that he was below the minimum vectoring altitude, and to maintain VFR.  The pilot responded by saying he could see pretty well and would take a northbound heading.  The last radar beacon target reported an altitude of 7,100 feet.  No further communications with the pilot were established.  The airplane impacted a mountain slope at an elevation of 6,683 feet and on a heading of about 350 degrees magnetic.  There were no preimpact airplane mechanical anomalies identified during the investigation.",

Two days before the accident, they flew to Idaho, and the next day they flew 4 hours. On the third day, the airplane was taxied from its parking spot on the ramp about 0740, and the pilot conducted a takeoff to about 50 feet, before landing straight ahead on the remaining runway. The investigation was unable to determine the purpose of this flight, or whether the passenger was on board at that time. The airplane was then taxied back to the ramp. About 13 minutes later, the airplane left the ramp again, taxied to the opposite runway, and began another takeoff roll. When the airplane was about 200 feet above the runway, the engine stopped developing power. The airplane stalled and spun to the ground, impacting on airport property near the departure end of the runway. Weight and balance calculations indicated that the airplane was likely 60 to 100 pounds above its maximum allowable weight, and that the center of gravity was about 1.7 inches forward of the aft limit, which would have increased the airplane pitch up tendency following the loss of engine power. Because the airplane was experimental and the pitch trim setting was unable to be determined during postaccident examination, the investigation was unable to determine whether there was sufficient control authority to prevent the stall and also what the required control forces would have been. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the two installed air filters had flow capacities well below the minimum value specified by the engine manufacturer, which would have limited the engine\u2019s ability to develop its full rated power. However, this was not a factor in this accident, because the airplane had been flown successfully in the previous days. The engine was not equipped with carburetor heat, even though it was required by the engine manufacturer. When plotted on a carburetor icing chart, the ambient air temperature and dew point values indicated that conditions for serious carburetor icing at cruise power existed. The engine-driven fuel pump was too damaged to test, but the engine manufacturer noted that it should have been replaced in accordance with a 2007 Service Bulletin, which warned that excessively high fuel pressure could result in \u201cengine malfunction and/or massive fuel leakage.\u201d Although the possibility exists that the engine experienced a total loss of power due to carburetor icing, excessive fuel pressure, or a combination of the two, the investigation was unable to conclusively determine whether either caused the loss of engine power. Finally, no evidence of an angle-of-attack or stall warning system was observed in the wreckage. Although not required, such a system might have alerted the pilot of the impending stall and helped him avoid the stall and subsequent spin. ",

During the flights, the N407MJ pilot had established two-way communications with his communications center and provided position reports, and the N407GA pilot had established two-way communications with FMC's communications center (which was his company's communication center and which also monitored and advised all traffic at the helipad) and provided position reports. The FMC communications center transportation coordinator advised the N407GA pilot that N407MJ would also be dropping off a patient at FMC. The coordinator also advised N407MJ's communication center that N407GA would be landing at FMC, but the N407MJ's communication center did not inform the N407MJ pilot nor was it required to do so.  Established arrival and departure procedures for the FMC helipad required pilots to contact the FMC communications center at the earliest opportunity or at a minimum of 5 miles from the helipad. According to the FMC communications center's staff, N407MJ's pilot did not make the required contact with the communications center at any time during the flight.  About 3 minutes before the collision, N407GA dropped off a medical crewmember at the local airport (about 5 miles south of the medical center) to reduce the weight on the aircraft and to improve aircraft performance during landing at the medical center. According to witness information, flight-track data, and a hospital surveillance video, N407GA approached the helipad from the south, flying past or slightly inside the southeast tip of the noise abatement area on a direct line toward a final approach position just east of the helipad. However, according to helipad arrival guidelines and company procedures, N407GA should have approached the helipad from farther to the east. (After the on-scene accident site investigation, the Air Methods regional chief pilot, accompanied by NTSB investigators, flew the accident route in another Air Methods Bell 407 using GPS data retrieved from N407GA. According to the regional chief pilot, the \u201ctrained route\u201d was much farther to the east and not in a direct line to the hospital.) N407MJ approached the helipad from the northeast, and it is likely that the pilot would have been visually scanning the typical flight paths, as described in the noise abatement and helipad arrival guidelines, that other aircraft approaching the medical center would have used. Thus, if N407GA had approached from a more typical direction, the pilot of N407MJ may have been more likely to see and avoid it.At the time of the collision, both pilots were at a point in the approach where their visual attention typically would have been more focused on the helipad in preparation for landing, rather than on scanning the surrounding area for other traffic. The helicopters collided approximately 1/4 mile east of the helipad. There were no communications from either helicopter just prior to or after the collision.  Neither helicopter was equipped with a traffic collision avoidance system, nor was such a system required. Had such a system been on board, it likely would have alerted the pilots to the traffic conflict so they could take evasive action before collision. No radar or air traffic control services were available for the helipad operations to ensure separation. However, if N407MJ's pilot had contacted the FMC communications center, as required, the FMC transportation coordinator likely would have told him directly that another aircraft was expected at the helipad. If the pilot had known to expect another aircraft in the area, he would have been more likely to look for the other aircraft. Nevertheless, the pilots were responsible for maintaining vigilance and to see and avoid other aircraft at all times. Under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Sections 91.111 and 91.113, all pilots are responsible for keeping a safe distance from other aircraft and for maintaining vigilance so as to see and avoid other aircraft. Advisory Circular 90-48C, \"Pilots' Role in Collision Avoidance,\" amplifies the see-and-avoid concept by stating that all pilots should remain constantly alert to all traffic movement within their field of vision and that they should scan the entire visual field outside of their aircraft to ensure that conflicting traffic would be detected. Examination of the wreckages revealed that N407MJ's tail rotor contacted the forward fuselage of N407GA, and N407GA's main rotor blades contacted and separated N407MJ's tail boom. The recovered wreckages showed no evidence of any preimpact structural, engine, or system failures.",
            "probable_cause": "Both helicopter pilots\u2019 failure to see and avoid the other helicopter on approach to the helipad. Contributing to the accident were the failure of N407GA\u2019s pilot to follow flight arrival route guidelines, and the failure of N407MJ\u2019s pilot to follow communications guidelines requiring him to report his position within a minimum of 5 miles from the helipad."

The Riverside County Sheriff's Department was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.  The deputy flight instructor (DFI) and the deputy student pilot sustained minor injuries. The helicopter sustained substantial damage. The local instructional flight departed Hemet about 1040. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.The DFI reported that he and the student started a maneuver to simulate a governor failure at 500 feet above ground level (agl) by switching the auto/manual switch to manual. They proceeded on an extended left downwind to runway 23 for 2.5 miles before turning base. They turned base to final, started descending, and reduced the throttle input (rolled off the throttle).As the helicopter approached the runway threshold at 50 to 100 feet agl, the DFI noticed that the rotor revolution per minute (rpm) was decreasing a little more than he expected. He attempted to roll the throttle past the limit switch, but noticed that he was not gaining any additional rpm. About 50 feet agl over the runway threshold, he noticed that the helicopter was descending at a faster rate of descent, and that the rotor rpm continued to decay. He attempted to regain rotor rpm by pulling aft cyclic and lowering the collective, but was unsuccessful in increasing rotor rpm. He noticed that as he moved the cyclic forward to a level attitude, he felt a \"resistance\" in the movement, and had trouble getting the cyclic to move forward. The helicopter then impacted the surface of the runway very hard, spun to the left, and came to rest on its left side facing northeast, the same direction from which it approached; it had rotated to the left 180 degrees.The DFI stated that there had been other instances with the cyclic being restricted in this make/model helicopter.",

The last transmission from the pilot was an acknowledgment of the cancellation of radar service and an instruction to switch to the airport advisory frequency. At that time, the airplane was at a mode C reported altitude of 14,000 feet. The airplane maintained a steady descent rate for the next minute and leveled off at 13,000 feet. About 2 1/2 minutes later, the airplane began a turn to the right to head outbound for the procedure turn on the approach and descended to 12,900 feet.  The approach procedure specified a minimum altitude of 8,200 feet in the procedure turn. The airplane lost 1,600 feet in the next 10 seconds, and this was the last radar contact. A witness working in his office at the airport heard a loud engine noise, and then a \u201cplop\u201d noise.  He said that the engine noise was loud, then softer, and then loud again.  He heard it for 3 to 5 seconds.  Another witness saw an airplane below the cloud bases that was turning to the right with a nose low pitch attitude of about 75 to 80 degrees.  It made six to seven turns before it disappeared from sight behind terrain, and the radius of the turn got tighter as the airplane descended.

The flight crewmembers continued the nonpertinent conversation throughout the entire taxi, which was not in accordance with company procedures and Federal regulations regarding sterile cockpit. CVR information also revealed that, although the flight crew completed all of the required checklist items during the taxi, each item was read and responded to in a very quick and routine manner.About 1609, the captain called for flaps 20 and then for the Taxi checklist. Flight data recorder (FDR) data indicated that, 1 second later, the flaps moved from the flaps 0 to the flaps 8 position. Further, while conducting the checklist, the first officer stated, \u201cflaps 8\u201d and \u201ceight degrees,\u201d indicating that he had selected the flap handle to the flaps 8 position, not to the flaps 20 position as called for by the captain. However, the captain responded, \u201cset\u201d and \u201ceight,\u201d respectively, indicating that he did not notice the incorrect flap setting. The rapid and perfunctory manner in which the flight crew conducted the Taxi checklist resulted in the captain not visually comparing the airplane\u2019s flap position with the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system data, which was his normal practice.After rapidly completing the Taxi checklist, the flight crew continued the nonpertinent conversation until the captain called for the Before Takeoff checklist. After the flight crew rapidly conducted this checklist, without including a proper takeoff briefing, the flight was cleared for takeoff. The takeoff was normal until the airplane reached an airspeed of about 120 knots. At this time, FDR data showed the flaps beginning to move from the flaps 8 to the flaps 20 position. Shortly thereafter, the first officer stated, \u201cV one [the takeoff decision speed],\u201d which was 127 knots. The CVR then recorded the sound of the airplane master caution and flaps and spoilers configuration aural alerts. The captain initiated a rejected takeoff (RTO) about 5 seconds after he started moving the flaps and when the airplane was at an airspeed of about 140 knots, which was 13 knots above V1.  Bombardier computed the total distance required for the incident airplane to accelerate stop using data from the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual and the planned takeoff performance data (including configuration, weight, altitude, and reduced thrust takeoff). The calculations indicated that the airplane would have stopped about 5,730 feet from the beginning of the takeoff roll if the deceleration had been initiated at the planned V1 (127 knots). Given that the runway was 6,300 feet long and that FDR data indicated a normal deceleration during the RTO, sufficient runway distance would have existed for the airplane to stop on the runway surface if the captain had initiated the RTO immediately after he identified the misconfigured flap setting instead of reconfiguring the flaps. The captain should have called for an RTO as soon as he recognized the flaps were in the wrong position. As a result of the captain\u2019s decision to attempt to reconfigure the flaps and delay the RTO, the airplane overran the runway end and entered the engineered materials arresting system (EMAS) at an airspeed of about 50 knots. The airplane stopped 128 feet into the EMAS arrestor bed with about 277 feet of arrestor bed remaining. Before the installation of the EMAS in September 2007, the runway end safety area for runway 23 was only 120 feet long. If this incident had occurred before the installation of the EMAS, the airplane most likely would have traveled beyond the length of the original safety area and off the steep slope immediately beyond its end.",
            "probable_cause": "(1) The flight crewmembers\u2019 unprofessional behavior, including their nonadherence to sterile cockpit procedures by engaging in nonpertinent conversation, which distracted them from their primary flight-related duties and led to their failure to correctly set and verify the flaps; (2) the captain\u2019s decision to reconfigure the flaps during the takeoff roll instead of rejecting the takeoff when he first identified the misconfiguration, which resulted in the rejected takeoff beginning when the airplane was about 13 knots above the takeoff decision speed and the subsequent runway overrun; and (3) the flight crewmembers\u2019 lack of checklist discipline, which contributed to their failure to detect the incorrect flap setting before initiating the takeoff roll. Contributing to the survivability of this incident was the presence of an engineered materials arresting system beyond the runway end."

The accident site was located in relatively level, wooded terrain.  The surrounding area was sparsely populated and heavily wooded.  The accident occurred prior to civil twilight and marginal VFR weather conditions were reported at the departure airport.  FAA radar data depicted an aircraft proceeding from the departure airport to the south, roughly paralleling a two-lane roadway.  The aircraft initially leveled at 2,500 feet pressure altitude.  The altitude gradually increased to 3,200 feet.  Shortly afterward, the aircraft entered a descending left turn to reach a minimum altitude of 2,400 feet.  This resulted in an average descent rate of 2,000 fpm.  The aircraft immediately began a climb, as the radius of the left turn decreased noticably.  Final radar contact was at 2,900 feet pressure altitude,  0.21 nautical miles, on a course of 278 degrees magnetic to the accident site.  The rate of climb averaged 2,500 fpm between the final two radar data points.  Several witnesses reported seeing an aircraft flying southbound shortly before the time of the accident.  They reported the aircraft was relatively low and was traveling at a high rate of speed.  None of the witnesses reported noticing any problems with the aircraft or engine.

Subsequent disassembly of the engine revealed compressor turbine blade fractures at varying heights above the platform and downstream damage to the power turbine blades. Further examination revealed that 13 blades were fractured at the platform, with 8 of those exhibiting fatigue fractures at the leading edge, and overload fractures toward the trailing edge. The remaining five blades exhibited ductile overload fractures over the entire fracture surface. A number of blades were also fixed to the disc, with the mating surfaces of both the blades and the disc exhibiting corrosion. Examination of blade serrations revealed an accumulation of orange dust, with black corrosion blisters observed at various locations. Dust analysis revealed sulphidation, with airborne salts likely reacting with the oxide layer on the blades to result in oxide layer decay.

At 1127, the controller provided the pilot with the 1115 weather observation for his destination as a few clouds at 2,100 feet agl, scattered clouds at 3,000 feet agl, broken clouds at 3,400 feet agl, and visibility of 7 statute miles.  Conversion of the cloud heights to msl, using the destination elevation of 6,445 feet msl, indicated the cloud bases were between 8,545 and 9,845 feet msl.  At 1129, the pilot advised the controller that he was going to descend from 12,500 to 10,500 feet msl.  When the controller asked the pilot if he was familiar with the high terrain in the area and the pilot said that he was not, the controller advised the pilot of instrument flight rules minimum altitudes (MIA's) in the area of his destination, ranging from 10,000 feet to 14,000 feet msl.  At 1136, radar data depicted the airplane 40 nautical miles southeast of its destination at 11,500 feet msl turning left toward the south.  An 1130 satellite image showed a band of clouds near the location where the airplane turned toward the south, with cloud tops estimated to be between 12,000 to 12,500 feet msl.  At 1139:36, radar data showed the flight approximately 5 nautical miles south of its 1136 position, level at 10,800 feet (2,800 feet agl).  The last radar contact was at 1141:31 and showed the airplane at an altitude of 10,800 feet, approximately 48 nautical miles southeast of the destination.  After radar contact was lost, the airplane reversed course and headed northwest towards the destination.  The airplane impacted mountainous terrain approximately 16 miles southeast of the destination at an elevation of approximately 10,400 feet msl.  Visible satellite images for 1145, 1200, and 1215 showed an area of scattered to broken clouds just west of the airplane's last radar (1141:31) position extending northward toward the destination.  The clouds became broken to overcast near the accident location.  It is likely that the airplane entered clouds shortly before impact.  The non-instrument rated private pilot had a total of 13 hours instrument flight time.  Examination of the airplane did not reveal any pre-impact anomalies that would have prevented its normal operation.",

Shortly after takeoff, about 4,000 feet msl, the pilot reported to ATC that he had an engine problem and would return to the airport.  The radar plot reveals a steady descent of the airplane from 4,000 feet msl to the accident site, approximately 2 miles from the designated airport.  Ground witnesses reported that they saw the airplane flying very low, about 500 feet agl, seconds prior to the accident apparently heading toward the departure airport.  The witnesses reported consistent observations of the airplane \"wobbling,\" then going into a steep knife-edge left bank before it dove into the ground.  Witnesses at the airport said that the pilot sought out help in getting his radios operating prior to takeoff, telling the witness, \"its been four and a half months since I've been in an airplane, I can't even figure out how to put the radios back in.\"  No fueling records were found for the airplane at the departure airport.  The last documented fueling of the airplane was on October 31, 2002, with the addition of 56.2 gallons.  Witnesses reported that the airplane did not take on any fuel immediately prior to the flight on May 4th.  The flight was the first flight since the airplane received its annual inspection 2 months prior to the accident, and, it was the pilot's first flight after 4 months of inactivity.  It is a common practice for maintenance personnel to pull the landing light circuit breakers during maintenance to prevent the fuel transfer pumps, which are wired through the landing light system, from operating continuously.  The fuel transfer pumps move fuel from the forward part of the main fuel tank to the center baffle area where it is picked up and routed to the engine.  It is conceivable that these circuit breakers were not reset by the pilot for this flight.  Wreckage examination revealed a post accident fire on the right wing of the airplane and no fire on the left wing.  Additionally, only a small amount of fuel was identified around the left wing tanks after the accident, and no hydraulic deformation was observed to the left main tank or the internal baffles.  The landing gear bellcrank indicates that the landing gear was in the down position.  The engine and propeller post impact signatures indicate that the left engine was operating at a low power setting (wind milling), while the right engine and propeller indicate a high power setting.  Disassembly and inspection of the internal propeller hub components showed that the left propeller was not feathered.  The left engine is the critical engine and loss of power in that engine would make directional control more difficult at slower speeds.  The airplane owners manual states that \"climb or continued level flight at a moderate altitude is improbable with the landing gear extended or the propeller wind milling.\"  The single engine flight procedure delineated in the manual dictates a higher than normal altitude for a successful single engine landing approach. ",

Factors related to the accident were fuel starvation of the left engine, due to an inadequate fuel supply in the left tanks, inoperative fuel transfer pumps, and the pilot's decision to takeoff with out fueling."

The pilot/owner reported that the pre-flight check and start-up were normal.  A magneto check with 1,800 rpm noted that the right magneto dropped about 75 rpm and the left magneto dropped about 100 rpm, which he reported as normal.  At the time of takeoff, the aircraft attained an altitude of about 100 feet above ground level, when the engine began to gradually lose power, \"like someone pulled the throttle or the throttle linkage broke.\"  The pilot/owner initiated a forced landing to a grape vineyard.  During the landing roll, the aircraft experienced a nose gear collapse, the firewall was damaged as well as the leading edge of the wings.  The engine was inspected then prepared for an engine run.  The engine was found to start right up and a magneto check was accomplished finding that the left magneto produced a 300 rpm drop.  The magnetos were then placed on a test bench.  Both magnetos produced a spark from all towers up to 3,000 rpm.  The ignition harness test found no anomalies.  No evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction was found with the engine.",

The multi-destination flight originated from the accident airport, about 16 hours before the accident.  On the final leg of the flight, the flight encountered stronger than anticipated headwinds, and the first officer voiced his concern several times about the airplane's remaining fuel.  As the flight approached the destination airport, the captain became concerned about having to fly an extended downwind leg, and told the ATCT specialist the flight was low on fuel.  The ATCT specialist then cleared the accident airplane for a priority landing.  According to cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data, while the crew was attempting to lower the airplane's wing flaps in preparation for landing, they discovered that the flaps would not extend beyond 8 degrees.  After the landing gear was lowered, the captain told the first officer, in part: \"The gear doors are stuck down.... no hydraulics.\"  The captain told the first officer: \"Okay, so we're gonna do, this is gonna be a ref and twenty...All right, probably not going to have any brakes...\"  According to a ATCT specialist in the control tower, the airplane touched down about midway on the 6001-foot long, dry runway.  It continued to the end of the runway, entered the overrun area, struck a chain link fence, crossed a road, and struck a building.  During a postaccident interview, the captain reported that during the landing roll the first officer was unable to deploy the airplane's emergency drag chute.  He said that neither he nor the first officer attempted to activate the nitrogen-charged emergency brake system.  The accident airplane was not equipped with thrust reversers.  A postaccident examination of the accident airplane's hydraulic pressure relief valve and hydraulic pressure regulator assembly revealed numerous indentations and small gouges on the exterior portions of both components, consistent with being repeatedly struck with a tool.  When the hydraulic pressure relief valve was tested and disassembled, it was discovered that the valve piston was stuck open.  The emergency drag chute release handle has two safety latches that must be depressed simultaneously before the parachute will activate.  An inspection of the emergency drag chute system and release handle disclosed no preaccident mechanical anomalies.    ",

Factors associated with the accident are the flightcrew's inadequate in-flight planning/decision making, which resulted in a low fuel condition; an open hydraulic relief valve, and inadequate maintenance by company maintenance personnel.  Additional factors were an inoperative (normal) brake system, an unactivated emergency drag chute, the flightcrew's failure to engage the emergency brake system, and pressure placed on the flightcrew due to conditions/events."

About five minutes later, while cruising at about 2,400 rpm, with oil pressure and oil temperature indicating normal, the engine suddenly stopped producing power. Although the wood propeller continued to windmill until the airplane was slowed to about 60 miles per hour, the pilot could not get the engine restarted and ultimately ditched in the ocean.

A subsequent records review revealed that the airplane had been flown for .6 of an hour on the previous day, and had not subsequently been refueled. According to the certified flight instructor,  who checked the pilot out in the airplane, the pilot was informed that due to its limited fuel quantity, when fully fueled, the airplane needed to be back at the airport two hours after departure.
