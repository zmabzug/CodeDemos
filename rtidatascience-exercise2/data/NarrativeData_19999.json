The engine lost all power during the initial climb out on a test flight following the completion of a 100-hour inspection.  The pilot initiated an autorotative descent.  While he maneuvered to avoid automobile traffic and power lines, the main rotor rpm decayed.  The helicopter touched down hard on a street and was destroyed by an intense fuel-fed ground fire.  The accident occurred during the first flight following maintenance performed by the on-board passenger, a mechanic employed by the operator.  The helicopter's airframe was examined and no evidence of preimpact anomalies were found.  Upon splitting the engine's case halves, all of the compressor blades on stages 1 through 6 were found either damaged or missing.  A piece of a wire tie wrap was noted adhering to one of the case halves in the 6th stage area.  Additionally, metallic debris was found in the outer combustion case (OCC).  The metallurgical examination of the OCC debris revealed it was composed of an aluminum-magnesium-silicon alloy, which was foreign to components used in the engine.  Wire tie wraps, similar to the tie wrap found in the engine, were also found in the accident site debris field.  Similar wire tie wraps were additionally observed in storage at the operator's maintenance facility.  The air intake to the engine's compressor is enclosed in a plenum chamber on the top of the helicopter.  Prior to the accident, the mechanic had been observed performing maintenance in this area.",

Factors were the presence of vehicles and power lines partially obstructing the forced landing site that necessitated the pilot's use of rotor system energy to avoid, which resulted in a hard landing."

The pilot reported that his windshield had become obscured by ice accumulation during the approach and that he \"had difficulty seeing the runway.\"  The pilot elected to land the airplane instead of executing the published missed-approach procedure.  The airplane impacted terrain 439 feet short of the runway threshold while in a right turn.  After the accident, there was ice accumulation on all booted airframe surfaces measuring 2-4 inches wide and 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick.  The upper portions of the windscreens were contaminated with ice measuring about 3/8 inch thick.  The remaining airframe portions, including the heated surfaces, were free of ice accumulation.  The windshield bleed air switch was selected on \"High\" with the pilot's side windshield heat control knob approximately mid-range.  Windshield alcohol was selected \"On\", but the alcohol reservoir was still full upon inspection.  At the time of the accident, there was an overcast ceiling of 500 feet agl, 1-3/4 statute mile visibility with mist, and an outside temperature of -08 degrees Celsius.  The published minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the GPS runway 17 approach is 500 feet agl, for an airplane equipped with a lateral navigation only GPS receiver.

The damaged section of the nose landing gear contacted and dug into grass on the opposite side of the taxiway, causing the airplane to nose over.  The inspector stated there were no mechanical issues associated with the accident.  Review of a certified copy of the voice tape from the air traffic control tower revealed that before the pilot contacted the facility, the local controller advised on the frequency to expect a runway change and the wind was from 010 to 040 degrees at 12 knots.  The pilot was cleared to land on runway 25, and was advised the wind was from 020 degrees at 12 knots.",

GPS altitude data depicted an immediate descent at a rate of 2,200 to 3,300 feet per minute, at a ground speed of 59 miles per hour. Examination of the wreckage revealed impact damage signatures on the fuselage, engine cowling, and wings consistent with a stall. No evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies was discovered. The investigation revealed discrepancies between the airspeed indicator and the airspeed guidance provided in the airplane flight manual. In addition, rate of climb data and the effects of nonstandard atmospheric pressure and nonstandard temperature on performance were not presented in the flight manual.

The witness stated that he heard the \"whine of the engines\" before the airplane impacted terrain about 1/2 mile south of the runway threshold. In the days preceding the accident flight, the airplane had been at a maintenance facility to resolve a vibration in the rudder system while the autopilot system was engaged. There were no anomalies reported with the autopilot system during a test flight completed immediately before the accident flight. However, anomalies with the rate gyro were noted by a mechanic who recommended replacing it, but the pilot departed on the accident flight without the recommended repair having been completed. Further, examination of the autopilot annunciator panel indicated that the autopilot was likely not engaged at the time of impact, likely because the airplane was on a short final approach for landing. Accordingly, any existing autopilot faults would not have affected the flight as the autopilot system was likely not in use. There were no failures identified with the primary flight controls, engines, or propellers that would have prevented the pilot from maintaining control of the airplane manually.

The private pilot and passenger were fatally injured and the airplane was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed. The local flight originated from Frazier Lake Airpark (1C9), Hollister, California about 1430 with an intended destination of Monterey Bay Academy Airport, Watsonville, California. A family member of the pilot reported the airplane overdue to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the evening of November 8, 2014, after becoming concerned when the pilot and passenger had not arrived at their intended destination. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Alert Notification (ALNOT) for the missing airplane. The wreckage was located on November 9 within a heavily wooded area about 5 miles north of 1C9 by search and rescue personnel. Examination of the accident site by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge revealed that the airplane collided with steep terrain and remained intact with exception to the propeller assembly which was located near the main wreckage. Both wings had leading edge damage, the engine and forward fuselage was severely crushed rearward, and the empennage remained attached with impact damage to the right horizontal stabilizer. All primary flight controls remained attached to the airplane. The separated propeller assembly revealed that one of its blades had multiple s-type bending and a small portion of that blade's tip was missing. The other blade was slightly bent rearward. Braided wire striations were observed on the outboard area of the right wing and propeller. Overhead distribution power lines located a few hundred feet from the main wreckage were found separated near their mid-spans. The lines were supported by two wooden H-frame pole assemblies at a distance of about 1,500 feet and spanned the valley below, about 300 feet above ground level.

Both pilots said that as they neared the area of the accident site the flight had to maneuver around areas of bad weather.  The helicopter was at 80 knots and 200 feet above ground level (agl) following a road while maneuvering around weather when a loud bang was heard and both engines suddenly lost power.  The flying pilot entered an autorotation and managed to get the helicopter onto the road.  The landing was hard and the main rotor blades flexed downward and damaged the empennage, then the helicopter rolled to the right.  The pilot said that just prior to the loud noise and the dual engine failure, the engine instrument indications were normal and the fuel gauges were reading around 1,500 pounds in each tank.  The fuel system was configured for normal operation; the number 1 engine feeding from the forward tank and the number 2 engine feeding from the aft tank, with boost pumps on and the crossfeed valve closed.  The engine and airframe deice/anti-ice systems were on and functioning, and no annunciator lights were illuminated concerning any of the systems elements.  The helicopter's Federal Aviation Administration approved and issued Type Certificate Data Sheet states that flight into known icing conditions is prohibited and notes that \"the helicopters approved under this type certificate are done so under the concept of limited exposure associated with escape from inadvertent ice encounters.\"  The anti-ice/deice systems on the helicopter consist of a combination of electrically and bleed air heated elements protecting the windshield, the oil tank mounting ring, engine air intake ducts, engine inlet guide vanes, starter cover, and the front frame of each engine.  In addition to the anti-ice systems, an engine inlet ice deflector shield can be installed in front of the engine inlets to prevent any accumulation of ice and snow that forms around the upper deck and mast area ahead of the engines from entering the engine inlets.  According to company Director of Maintenance and the subsequent examination of the wreckage, the optional engine inlet ice/snow deflector shields were not installed.  The pilot received three preflight weather briefings from two separate Automated Flight Service Stations (AFSS), with the first two from the same station and the third from a different one.  In the first briefing, the pilot was told that a routing from Oregon down to southern California could expect widespread IFR conditions due to mountain obscurement, clouds, precipitation, icing, and turbulence.  An hour later the pilot called the same AFSS, but spoke to a different briefer, who told the pilot he had overheard the earlier briefing and then suggested the pilot consider a routing through northern Nevada to Utah, then south to Arizona.  The specialist then stated that two stations east of the Cascade Mountain range had high scattered clouds with good visibility, and Winnemucca, Nevada, had current conditions of 8,500 broken.  The pilot responded, \"Oh, really.\"  The specialist then said \"it was...like clear below 12,000\" all the way to Cedar City, Utah, and concluded with, \"I think once you get by like Winnemucca or Elko (Nevada) things improve drastically.\"  The pilot responded, \"We may just try that.\"  An hour and a half later the pilot called and reached a different AFSS facility and asked about the conditions on the northern Nevada routing.  The specialist said that presently there were AIRMETS in effect over the route for moderate rime and mixed icing, moderate turbulence, mountain obscurement and general IFR conditions over the entire area.  The specialist said that VFR flight was not recommended over that route and another two alternate routings the pilot inquired about, and he cautioned the pilot that icing conditions would be moderate rime and mixed icing in clouds and precipitation from the surface to 21,000 feet, especially in the Ely, Nevada, area.  Analysis of the actual weather conditions disclosed that en route to the accident site, the helicopter probably encountered occasional snow showers with low ceilings and visibilities.  The freezing level was at or near the surface and that in-flight icing was likely from the surface to 18,000 feet.  The formation of airframe ice due to the freezing of melted snow was also possible.  The airframe fuel and anti-icing systems were functionally tested and operated normally.  The number 1 engine had inlet guide vane trailing edge and first stage compressor blade leading edge damage that was consistent with the ingestion of ice chunks.  Detailed disassembly of the number 1 engine revealed no other damage, condition, or abnormality that would have precluded normal operation.  The number 2 engine was not damaged and was installed in a test cell where it ran normally.  The fuel system components from the number 1 engine where then installed on the number 2 and the test cell run repeated with identical results to the first test.",
            "probable_cause": "the loss of power in both engines due to the ingestion of ice and snow.  Also causal was the pilot's preflight and in-flight decisions to fly into areas of known and forecast moderate icing conditions in contravention to the prohibitions contained in the helicopter's Federal Aviation Administration approved Type Certificate Data sheet.  A factor in the accident was the failure of the company maintenance organization to install the optional ice/snow deflector shields in front of the engine inlets that are designed to prevent the ingestion of ice and snow.  An additional factor was the inaccurate and inappropriate weather briefing provided by the second AFSS specialist."

The cockpit voice recorder showed multiple instances during the flight in which the airplane was below 10,000 feet mean sea level that the crew was engaged in discussions that were not consistent with a sterile cockpit environment, for example a lengthy discussion about Class B airspeeds, which may have led to a relaxed and casual cockpit atmosphere. In addition, the flight crew appears to have conducted checklists in a generally informal manner. As the flight was conducted by a Part 135 operator, it would be expected that both pilots were versed with the importance of sterile cockpit rules and the importance of adhering to procedures, including demonstrating checklist discipline.For approximately the last 24 seconds of flight, both pilots were likely focusing their attention on activities to identify and understand the reason for the airplane's roll handling difficulties, as noted by the captain's comment related to the fuel balance. These events, culminating in the first officer's urgent command to add full power, suggested that neither pilot detected the airplane's decaying energy state before it reached a critical level for the conditions it encountered.          Light bulb filament examination revealed that aileron augmentation system and stall warning lights illuminated in the cockpit. No mechanical anomalies were found to substantiate a failure in the aileron augmentation system. No additional mechanical or system anomalies were noted with the airplane. A performance study, limited by available data, could not confirm the airplane's movements relative to an aileron augmentation system or spoileron problem. The level of airframe icing and its possible effect on the airplane at the time of the accident could not be determined.",

He had made the roundtrip several times but had never landed at any of the four alternate airports along the route.  On the day of the accident he decided to take a friend with him on this routine trip and checkout the airports on the way back.  The first airport was closed so they overflew the runway at 500 agl.

The pilot informed his passenger that they would not be landing at the fourth airport, but instead they would perform a low-level flyby.  During the pilot's training his flight instructor had informed him that the accident airport was a one-way runway due to obstructions at the north end.  According to published information you land on runway 36 and take off on runway 18 due to rising terrain and unfavorable winds.  During the low-level flyby of runway 36, about 15 to 20 feet agl, the pilot reported that he experienced a strong downdraft, and subsequently during the attempted go-around into rising terrain, the airplane collided with trees.

On the morning of the accident flight, the national service manager and the pilot of the accident airplane pulled both of the airplanes that were to be used for the aerial photography flight out from under the display tent. Both airplanes had their left wings in the folded position. When they pulled the accident airplane out from under the display tent, the national service manager was at the left wing root.

            "narrative": "On February 11, 2015, about 1415 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-140, N5985U, was substantially damaged when it collided with trees and terrain after a loss of engine power during initial climb at Air Harbor Airport (W88), Greensboro, North Carolina. The private pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to witnesses, the pilot was observed to start up the airplane, and taxi to an area near the end of Runway 27, where he performed an engine run up. The airplane was next heard to takeoff. The airplane was however not heard to come back around in the traffic pattern. As a result, one of the operator's employees got into a golf cart and drove down to the end of Runway 27. Upon reaching the end of the runway, the employee found the wrecked airplane. He approached the airplane, but did not stay, as fuel was flowing out of the wing area. He immediately returned and called 911. Examination of the runway revealed that Runway 27 had been built up above the surrounding terrain on an area of reclaimed earth. Examination of the accident site revealed that after takeoff from Runway 27, the airplane turned left, descended, and then struck approximately 65 foot high trees, which existed on the side of a small hill at the edge of a wooded area which was present on a 225 degree magnetic heading, 401 feet off the departure end of Runway 27. The airplane first made contact with the trees at a point 45 feet above ground level, then dropped to the forest floor, coming to rest on its left side wedged between two trees on a magnetic heading of 192 degrees, at an elevation of approximately 769 feet above sea level.Examination of the wreckage revealed that, the fuselage exhibited multiple areas of crush and compression damage and the aft fuselage had been bent about 45 degrees to the left during the impact sequence. The cabin however was mostly intact. Examination of the restraint system revealed that the airplane had been equipped with lap belts but was not equipped with shoulder harnesses.The left wing exhibited crush and compression damage on the leading edges, and compression damage at the inboard trailing edge. It had remained attached, with the exception of an approximate 4 foot long outboard section that had been separated from the left wing during the impact with the trees at the edge of the wooded area.The right wing was almost completely separated from the fuselage at the wing root, and it exhibited impact damage in several places including a large depressed area which was present at approximately mid-span where the wing skin had been crushed back to the wing spar. Examination of the instrument panel and flight controls revealed that the throttle was in the full throttle position, the mixture was full rich, and the carburetor heat was off. The primer was in and locked. The airspeed indicator needle indicated approximately 66 knots. The tachometer indicated approximately 1,100 rpm. The flap handle was in the flaps up position and control continuity was established from the ailerons, stabilator, and rudder, to the control wheels and rudder pedals in the cockpit. Examination of the propeller revealed that the propeller spinner exhibited crush damage only on the tip and one side of the spinner and the propeller had remained partially attached to the crankshaft flange. The flange was bent and three propeller bolts were broken. One propeller blade was bent aft about 10 degrees at approximately mid-span. The other propeller blade was bent aft about 30 degrees at approximately mid-span. Its tip was also bent forward about 10 degrees. There was no evidence of leading edge gouging, or chordwise scratching on either blade.Examination of the engine revealed that it had remained attached to the firewall by the engine mount. The engine was removed from the firewall, suspended from a lift, and partially disassembled to facilitate the examination. The drivetrain was rotated and continuity of the crankshaft to the rear gears and to the valve train was confirmed. Compression and suction were observed on all four cylinders. The interiors of the cylinders were observed using a lighted borescope and no anomalies were noted. Spark was produced on both magnetos when rotated, and the spark plugs appeared normal with the exception of the No. 2 cylinder's bottom sparkplug which was impact damaged. Oil was also present in the engine, and both the oil suction screen and oil filter were clean and absent of debris.Examination of the fuel system revealed that, the carburetor had remained attached to the engine. It was removed and partially disassembled. About 2 teaspoons of fuel were observed in the carburetor float bowl. The carburetor fuel inlet screen was absent of debris and no damage to the carburetor internal components was noted. The engine driven fuel pump also remained attached to the engine and was impact damaged. The pump was removed and partially disassembled. A small amount of fuel drained from the pump when it was tilted. No damage to the rubber pump diaphragms or check valves was noted.The airplane fuel strainer was disassembled and it was devoid of fuel. The airplane electric fuel pump was also disassembled and it was also devoid of fuel. The strainer and pump fuel screens contained no debris.The fuel selector valve handle was discovered to be in the right tank position. The fuel selector valve was then removed from the airplane. With the handle in the right tank position, it was discovered that when using an air source, no air could be blown through the selector valve. Subsequent attempts to exercise the selector valve revealed that it was stiff to rotate; and positive engagements of the detents could not consistently be duplicated. Further attempts to flow air through the valve met with intermittent results. Disassembly of the valve revealed that no lubrication was present in the assembly, rotational scoring was present in the valve body, and the internal valve components and detent positions were worn.According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on January 20, 2014. He reported that he had accrued 550 total hours of flight experience. According to FAA and airplane maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 1970. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on January 6, 2015. At the time of the inspection, the airplane had accrued approximately 3787.86 total hours of operation, and the engine had accrued approximately 1466.86 total hours of operation since major overhaul.The fuel selector valve was retained by the NTSB for further examination.",

The FAA aeronautical study for the installation of the NDB determined that the antenna was not a hazard to air navigation and did not require obstruction lighting.  Airport personnel reported the runway lights and rotating beacon had been turned off to close the airport to night operations the night of 9/29; however, a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) was not filed.  Prior to initiating the flight, the pilot received a weather briefing during which he specifically requested NOTAMs on the airport and was informed that none were on file.  Witnesses observed the airplane circle the airport 'two or three times' before entering a descent 'like it was going to land.'  Toxicological testing detected doxylamine (Unisom), which is not approved for use while flying, in the pilot's urine.

The pilot stated that a clear fluid was running down the cabin side of the firewall from an area right of center.  The right seat passenger reported that the leak appeared to be coming from behind the instrument panel directly in front of her position.  The pilot then pulled back the power slowly and headed for the closest airport.  A passenger and the ground witnesses described the touchdown and rollout as normal until an explosion occurred, which filled the cabin with flames and blew the entry door off the right side of the airplane.  Witnesses on the ground reported seeing flames coming out of the front-bottom of the aircraft before hearing a \"pop\" in conjunction with the explosion inside the cockpit.  The fabric-over-tubular-steel-frame airframe was thermally destroyed except for the steel components.  An examination of the thermal damage patterns disclosed that the most extensive thermal damage appeared to be forward of the right front seat where the passenger reported the fluid leak.  Also parts of the metal frame were severely warped, especially on the lower right-hand side near the firewall and below where the instrument panel would be.  In addition the bottom braces of the engine mount were warped due thermal damage.  Furthermore, there was sooting and heat resultant discoloration on the firewall in the engine compartment.  On the topside and on the right-hand side of the firewall red and black discoloration without sooting was evident.  The color on the right side of the firewall was a mixture of black and tan, with a little red.  On the bottom part of the firewall there was minimal sooting and a tan color.  The only flammable fluid lines on the right quadrant of the firewall are the pressure measurement lines for fuel, engine oil, and hydraulics.  These Mil-6000 hose lines are connected to firewall and pass-through fittings, that are located almost directly in front of the right seat passenger's location on the upper part of the firewall.  On the cabin side of the firewall, three other Mil-6000 hoses connect these fittings to a \"3-in-1\" instrument panel gage that displays the operating pressure of these three systems.  No evidence was found in the maintenance records that these fuel lines had ever been replaced.  While the fuel related components (i.e. carburetor, fuel pump, and associated lines) attached to the engine were thermally damaged, the degree of damage was significantly less than the fuel components attached to the firewall.  The thermal damage and sooting patterns indicate that an accelerant based fire originated on both sides of the firewall near the bottom.",
            "probable_cause": "A fuel leak on the cabin and engine sides of the firewall with a probable origin at the firewall pass-through fitting for the fuel pressure gage line.  The fire likely began on the engine side of the firewall near the bottom with the explosive ignition of the pooled fuel/vapors in the cockpit after burn through penetration of the fuselage fabric skin on the bottom aft side of the firewall.  Further refinement of the leak source between the pass-through fitting and the lines/connectors could not be established due to thermal destruction of the components."

The accident occurred following the pilot's attempted repairs to his airplane and during the third attempted flight. The pilot reported that within minutes after takeoff, he observed smoke in the cabin and saw flames near his feet. With diminishing visibility due to smoke filling the cockpit, the pilot returned to the airport and landed. The passenger exited the airplane before it rolled to a stop, and the pilot followed shortly thereafter. The airplane was consumed by the fire. The pilot had attempted to investigate the first and second smoke in the cockpit events, with the assistance of personnel from a local fixed base operator, and found a loose hose. The pilot opted to purchase a hose attachment clamp from a neighborhood consumer supply store, and thereafter proceeded with its installation. No maintenance entry was accomplished for the work. The subsequent investigation revealed that the precipitating smoke event was not related to the hose, but rather was due to a burn through of the airplane's exhaust muffler.  FAA inspectors examined the airplane and found that the engine exhaust muffler had burned through at the bottom left end and the hole permitted engine exhaust gasses and flames to be directed into the engine compartment and toward the firewall. The exhaust heat had also ruptured an aluminum hydraulic brake line, mounted on the firewall, which added to the fire.  An examination of the airplane's maintenance records revealed that an annual inspection had been performed on July 6, 2007, 2.5 operating hours prior to the accident. The airplane's listed time in service was 3,104.3 hours. The logbook signoff included the statement that the airplane was found to be in an airworthy condition, and airworthiness directive 68-05-01 (exhaust inspection) had been complied with. Airworthiness Directive 68-05-01 became effective in 1968, and it requires inspections of exhaust mufflers installed in specific models of airplanes, including the accident airplane. The inspection directs that muffler assemblies (with over 950 hours in service) be examined for signs of cracks, corrosion, burn-throughs, heat damage, collapsed stack, or weld separations.  According to Piper Service Letter number 324C, which was incorporated in the airworthiness directive, an exhaust and heat exchange system, which has been permitted to deteriorate due to age, poor inspection and maintenance, can conceivably cause \"engine compartment originated fires in flight.\"",

Morris Ag Air & Sons, Inc., was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 137.  The commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured.  The airplane was destroyed.  The local aerial application flight departed about 1015.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan had not been filed.The pilot was in radio contact with a spotter, who witnessed the accident and was also employed by the operator. He stated that the pilot departed about 0730 and had already sprayed one load of chemical. He reloaded and sprayed two fields with the accident location intended to be the last spray of that trip. The spotter had driven ahead to the accident field and was waiting for the airplane to come from the southerly adjacent field. The pilot made a transmission to the spotter asking what the wind conditions were at the field. The spotter replied by telling him that there was a light wind from the southwest.The spotter further stated that he witnessed the airplane coming from the north and clear the powerlines on the south perimeter of the field. The airplane then pitched in a nose-high attitude consistent with the pilot's normal operation of pushing the chemical toward the spread doors. The airplane continued to climb in a near vertical ascent until reaching about 500 feet above ground level (agl), at which point it transitioned into a nose-low vertical decent and collided into the field.",

The accident airplane was one of two airplanes transporting lodge guests.  The beach was located along an area of coast on the south side of low mountains.  The pilots of the two airplanes discussed several routes of travel to the lodge, located on the north side of the mountains.  All of the routes necessitated traversing mountain passes of varying elevations.  A scattered layer of low clouds partially obscured several mountain tops.  The two pilots verbally agreed to head toward a pass that would require a longer flight, but would traverse lower terrain. After the two airplanes departed the beach, the pilot of the second airplane was initially leading the flight of two airplanes.  After departure, the pilot of the first airplane reported that the most direct route through the mountains appeared to be open, and he elected to proceed toward the pass.  The pilot of the second airplane then followed the first airplane by about 1/3 mile, and remained in radio contact with the first pilot.  The two airplanes climbed to 3,000 feet msl, heading for the mountain pass.  The second pilot said that 3,000 feet msl was the minimum altitude that he and the first pilot normally utilized to cross the pass.  As the two airplanes proceeded northbound toward the pass, the pilot of the second airplane observed a solid layer of low clouds obscuring the pass, and he began to lose sight of the first airplane in clouds.  He then lost sight of the first airplane, and began making a 180 degree turn to proceed toward lower terrain.  The pilot of the first airplane radioed to the second pilot that he might want to turn around. The second pilot was already in a turn, and he asked the first pilot if he was turning around.  The first pilot replied by stating, 'well, I'm kind of committed now.'  That was the last radio contact with the pilot of the first airplane. The second pilot proceeded over lower terrain to the lodge.  The first airplane was not there.  The second pilot departed the lodge, searching for the first airplane.  Near the mountains, the ceilings were about 900 feet overcast. The second pilot said he could hear an ELT signal near the mouth of a creek drainage.  He could only get within about 5 miles of the pass.  The accident airplane was reported overdue, but because of low clouds, a search helicopter was unable to reach the area of the mountain pass.

The subsequent landing was uneventful. Before departing on the accident flight with two other revenue passengers, the pilot checked the windsock and elected to depart on a runway away from rising terrain with a gusting 90-degree right crosswind.

A witness observed the helicopter descending toward an open field from an altitude about 150 feet above ground level. The helicopter then descended to about 50 feet, leveled briefly, then \u201cfell\u201d straight to the ground, and erupted in flames. The wreckage was partially consumed by a postimpact fire.\u000b\u000bExamination of the wreckage following the accident revealed that the engine\u2019s carburetor float bowl was absent of fuel and contaminated with a rust-colored powder, which contained both ferrous and non-ferrous metal. Detailed examination of particulate matter collected from the filter housing of the fuel truck used to service the helicopter showed those components to be similarly contaminated. Additionally, during a postaccident demonstration of the procedure used to fuel the helicopter, the initial fuel dispensed was brown and gold in color. The operator of the fuel truck noted that it was typical to continue dispensing fuel into a separate container until it \u201cturned blue,\u201d before beginning to fill the helicopter.\u000b\u000bThe extent to which the fuel onboard the helicopter at the time of the accident was contaminated could not be determined due to the extent of the post-impact fire and lack of available fuel samples from the helicopter. However; based on the powdered contamination recovered from the carburetor float bowl, it is likely that the fuel contamination was significant enough to result in a partial or total loss of engine power, which would have required that the pilot conduct an off-airport precautionary landing, or autorotation and forced landing.\u000b\u000bThe pilot\u2019s toxicology testing revealed a carbon monoxide level that was consistent with the autopsy findings of abundant soot in the upper and lower airways and indicated exposure to combustion products in the postimpact fire. It was unlikely that an elevated level of carbon monoxide was present in the pilot\u2019s blood before that crash. Toxicology testing also indicated that the pilot had used diphenhydramine before the accident. Diphenhydramine, a sedating antihistamine used to treat allergy symptoms and as a sleep aid. Diphenhydramine can cause marked sedation, altered mood, and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance may. The pilot\u2019s diphenhydramine levels were above the therapeutic range, but may have been redistributed following death. Thus, it is likely the pilot had therapeutic levels of diphenhydramine in his system at the time of the crash. The pilot\u2019s time-critical decision-making and ability to perform an effective autorotation and/or landing\u00a0were likely impaired by the use of diphenhydramine.\u000b",

The pilot lost directional control while attempting to stop the aircraft on the 2,700 foot-long dirt runway and it veered off the right side of the airstrip, crossed a drainage canal, and collided with the opposite embankment.  Engine disassembly revealed that the second stage turbine wheel rim separated over almost its entire circumference.  Detailed examination of the hub's fracture found machining type scoring to a depth of about 0.1 inches on the forward face of the wheel, which reduced the strength in the wheel web until overload failure occurred.  Inspection of the second stage turbine stator assembly found that the sheet metal support for the turbine wheel to stator air seal was separated from the stator and had shifted forward to contact the failed wheel.  Twenty-two out of  31 cooling passages which pass through the stator vanes from the outside diameter of the stator to the seal support area were completely plugged by braze repair material.  The braze material had flowed from the outside diameter toward the inside during an attempt to braze repair the sheet metal on the castings outside diameter.

Examination of the PWC PT6A-20 engine revealed several compressor turbine blades had fractured and been released into the engine gas path.  The blades also impacted adjacent and downstream components.  The compressor turbine blades used in the engine were not approved by PWC; however, they were PMA manufactured with FAA approval.  Since engine overhaul, the engine had accumulated 10,978.8 hours and 15,059 cycles.  According to the FAA, the PWC recommended overhaul time of 3,600 hours.  The airplane was being operated on a USDA Forest Service contact that required the engine to have been overhauled within the manufacturer's specifications.  The engine's time since overhaul was not discovered by the Forest Service when they accepted the airplane for use on their contract.",
            "probable_cause": "A compressor turbine blade fracture which resulted in a power loss, and forced landing.  Factor were the rocks in the landing area, and the operator's decision to operate the engine beyond the engine manufacturer's recommendations for overhaul."

Postaccident examination of the engine and airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures\u00a0that would have precluded normal operation. The length and direction of the debris field was consistent with the helicopter traveling in the direction of, and at a rate of speed consistent with, a seed dispersal run.\u000b\u000bThe pilot was familiar with the area and was aware of the transmission lines, having performed a reconnaissance flight and flown over them multiple times during the previous flights that day. In the area of the accident site, the power lines began an ascent up an adjacent hill, with the static lines diverging such that they were about 40 feet higher than the power lines at the collision location. The static lines were of thinner gauge and could easily have been obscured by the surrounding hilly terrain. The lines were depicted on the relevant Federal Aviation Administration sectional chart. The helicopter was not equipped with a wire strike protection system nor was it required to be under the terms of the DOI contract. Neither the power nor static lines were equipped with visibility markers nor were they required to be due to their elevation above ground level.\u000b\u000bThe pilot had flown 40.5 hours over the last 5 days as part of the reseeding project, which was just short of the DOI contract maximum. A review his sleep history indicated that he received adequate rest the night before the accident. On the morning of the accident, he had flown 10 application runs in an area about 70 miles away. He took a lunch break about 3 hours before the accident, then flew 20 separate seed application runs and 10 reloads. His total flight time for that day was 6.6 hours. The low-level and \u201cnap of the earth\u201d flight operations required considerable concentration, most likely resulting in task-and/or work-related fatigue at the end of the day. By comparison, the United States Army recommends a maximum flight time of 8 hours per day or 37 hours per week, with a reduction of a factor of 1.3 to 1.6 for low-level and \u201cnap of the earth\u201d flying; thus the pilot would have exceeded their duty hour recommendations for each of the 5 days leading up to and including the accident day.\u000b\u000bThe pilot held an assisted special issuance second-class medical certificate based on a reported history of diabetes for which he was taking medication. His most recent medical examination revealed a new diagnosis for hypertension, as well as preexisting cataracts in both eyes, which exhibited no change since his last examination a year prior. In part due to the lack of an autopsy, the relevance of these findings, combined with his likely work-related fatigue, could not be determined.",

The amount of Benadryl (a nonprescription sedating antihistamine) found in the pilot\u2019s blood was in the therapeutic range, suggesting recent use. Diphenhydramine has been found to cause more performance degradation in therapeutic doses than a low dose of alcohol. It is likely that the diphenhydramine impaired the pilot\u2019s performance and contributed to the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain control during the takeoff climb, which resulted in a stall at low altitude and collision with terrain. Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s impaired performance from over-the-counter medications."

Numerous witnesses observed smoke trailing from the airplane; one of which observed the smoke up to nine minutes prior to the accident.  The pilot reported a loss of oil pressure and subsequent loss of engine power.  Some witnesses observed the airplane stall, roll to the right, and descend vertically.  The airplane exploded upon impact with the terrain.  Post-accident examination of the engine revealed the number six connecting rod end cap failed due to oil starvation.  The oil starvation resulted from a piston blow-by condition that formed in the number six cylinder.  The blow-by condition resulted in crankcase pressurization and the loss of the oil through the breather tube.  The blow-by condition also resulted in the burning of oil in the number six cylinder, which resulted in the smoke observed by the witnesses.  The cause of the blow-by situation was not determined.",
            "probable_cause": "Failure of the engine due to the blow-by condition in the number six cylinder for undetermined reasons, which resulted in oil starvation and eventual failure of the  associated connecting rod end cap.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to maintain airspeed during the forced landing, which resulted in an inadvertent stall and subsequent collision with terrain.  "

He started the engine,  checked all the gauges, found no anomalies, and departed.  During the flight, the pilot preformed several touch-and-goes at several different airports before proceeding to his planned destination.  At his destination, the pilot maneuvered the airplane to land.  Once on final, the pilot selected approach flaps, but they did not extend.  With the throttle completely retarded, the pilot started executing \"S\" turns to maintain a proper descent rate.  On short final, the pilot noticed that the airplane was right of the runway so he turned left, and then started a flare to land.  The airplane touched down and went off the runway to the left.  It then hit a hangar and parked airplane about 500 feet from the approach end of the runway before coming to an stop.  Continuity of the flaps system could not be verified because of impact damage.",
