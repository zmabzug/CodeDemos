The pilot stopped the airplane but did not shut down the engine or exit the airplane. Instead, he leaned out the door of the low-wing airplane to check for anomalies. He did not report seeing anything unusual; however, the wing would have blocked his view of the landing gear. He then taxied the airplane, departed, and did not experience any anomalies or difficulties with the airplane during that departure and flight. However, the student was concerned about the event at the first destination, so he opted not to land at the second planned destination, and, instead, he circled a few times and then headed toward the base airport. Although the flight school encouraged students to solicit assistance in the event of off-site problems and the pilot could have contacted the school via radio, he did not do so nor did he explain why he did not do so. The landing at the base airport was normal until the nose gear touched down, and the airplane subsequently veered right and departed the runway. The airplane struck a runway distance sign and a berm, which substantially damaged the nose and right main landing gear.

The aviation medical examiner that issued the pilot his most recent third-class medical certificate was not the pilot's personal physician that was treating him for diabetes. The pilot's primary care physician prescribed Humalog 75/25 insulin for treatment of diabetes. Humalog 75/25 insulin has a very rapid onset of glucose-lowering action, and the manufacturer recommends that the dose be given within 15 minutes before eating a meal to avoid hypoglycemia (low blood glucose), a condition which can lead to behavioral changes, confusion, fatigue, seizures, and loss of consciousness.  The pathologist that conducted the postmortem examination noted that the pilot's stomach was empty.    Postmortem toxicology tests revealed the presence of glucose in the pilot's urine, suggesting that his blood glucose was likely over 180 mg/dL at some time between his awakening and the time of the accident (normal levels are typically between 80 and 120 mg/dL).",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane, which resulted in an uncontrolled descent and subsequent in-flight collision with trees.  A factor associated with the accident was a low altitude maneuver preformed by the pilot just after takeoff."

The CFI verified that the friction lock was unlocked and attempted to push the throttle forward with both hands; however, the throttle would not advance forward.

Examination of the fracture surfaces revealed features characteristic of fatigue cracking in multiple locations.  The fatigue cracks originated at the surface of the holes, at the edge between the wall of the hole and flat face of the leg.  Separation of the spring strut was caused by fatigue cracks that originated from the surface of the two upper holes.  No chamfer was found at the surfaces of the two upper holes.  The surface of these holes contained for the most part a corner edge that is a stress raiser and, in turn, this stress raiser sensitized the hole to cracking.

The pilot was fatally injured and the passenger was seriously injured. The rotorcraft was registered to and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, with no flight plan filed. The local flight departed from Humboldt Municipal Airport (0K7), Humboldt, Iowa at an unknown time.  A witness noticed the rotorcraft enter into a steep descent with a reduction in engine noise, followed by an increase in engine noise. The rotorcraft subsequently impacted a tree and fell to the ground, which damaged the fuselage. Several segments of the engine's 3-bladed propeller were located as far as 200 feet from the main wreckage. The propeller was retained for further examination.

Witnesses and the passenger, a private pilot, said the airplane was between 300-500 feet above the ground at the time of  the power loss, when the pilot made a steep, abrupt, 180 degree turn to return to the airport.  The airplane immediately entered a stall/spin, and the pilot, who had prior aerobatic training, made a partial recovery, stopping the spin rotation, and returning the airplane to a nearly level attitude before impact.  The airplane crashed in a marshy area, in a level attitude, with a high vertical velocity.   The area north of the airpark was essentially flat, mostly unoccupied, with minimal obstructions.  There were several areas suitable for a low altitude emergency landing ahead of, and in close proximity to, the accident airplane's original departure flight path.  According to the passenger (the airplane's co-owner and pilot's wife), the airplane had a history of unexplained power losses on takeoff, and the pilot had successfully returned to the departure runway at various sites on at least two, possibly three, prior occasions. On one power loss at a different airport, the passenger was flying, and the accident pilot took the controls and made a steep turn back to the airport.  Once on the ground, the engine appeared to run normally.  The passenger indicated that on the accident flight, like previous flights, the loss of engine power was abrupt, \"like pulling the engine to idle\" but the engine did not stop completely.

After receiving the fire warning, the pilots discharged a fire suppression bottle and the fire ceased. There were no injuries to the three crewmembers on board and no airplane damage was reported. The incident flight was a regularly scheduled cargo flight, operated by China Airlines under provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 129, from Taipei, Taiwan, to Dallas with stops in Anchorage, Alaska, and Atlanta, Georgia.Initial visual examination of the engine found that at the No. 2 fuel nozzle position, the right fuel manifold feeder tube aft o-ring support was displaced rearward against the snap ring. When the No. 2 fuel nozzle feeder tube shroud was removed, the feeder tube was found fractured and separated between the feeder tube-to-ferrule weld joint and the aft o-ring, which is one of the features that prevents a fuel leak when the feeder tube fractures. Metallurgical examination revealed that the feeder tube fractured due to lower alternating stress high-cycle fatigue cracking that transitioned to increasing alternating stress fatigue cracking before ultimately failing in overload. Further, the o-ring had sustained a spiral-like separation. Additional examination confirmed that no inclusions or any material anomalies at the feeder tube crack initiation sites and that the material properties of the feeder tube and o-ring and the weld quality met their required specifications. The fracture mode of the feeder tube is well-documented and GE issued Service Bulletin (SB) 73-0371 to introduce a redesigned fuel manifold and bracket to address this issue. Service Bulletin 73-0371 also introduced changes to the manifold feeder tube configuration and orientation (to avoid resonance frequencies of the manifold that were within the engine operating range) to prevent fuel manifold fractures and wear-through of the tube thickness that had resulted in previous fuel leaks and undercowl fires. The SB was issued just 7 days before the installation of the incident fuel manifold on the incident engine; therefore the operator was unable to install the most current fuel manifold design.",

Contributing to the incident was that the engine was overhauled about the same time as the most current fuel manifold configuration that addressed the high amplitude fatigue failure mode was introduced, thus it was not installed on the engine."

The pilot was unable to maintain 13,000 feet, and descended to 12,000 feet, then to the minimum en route altitude of 11,000 feet. Unable to maintain this altitude, the pilot descended to 10,500 feet, cancelled his IFR flight plan, and descended further to 9,500 feet, at which point radio communications with ARTCC were lost. The airplane was yawing and \"the ball (turn coordinator) was in the right side.\" The pilot held \"full right aileron deflection to keep the [air]plane from turning.\" He attempted to make a precautionary landing at an airport. A left crosswind aided in keeping the airplane on track, but he was \"unable to use the rudder to straighten out the [air]plane to land.\" At 100 feet above the ground, the pilot attempted a go-around. With flaps up, landing gear down, and full power applied, the airplane would not climb but descended slowly instead. The pilot made a forced landing in an open field 1 mile south of the airport.

The FDR indicated that while the autopilot was engaged in the descent, the power levers moved from the mechanical autothrottle limit of 44 degrees to the manual limit of 37 degrees.  As the aircraft leveled at 16,000 feet the airspeed decreased.  The F/O began a right turn to enter a holding pattern and added some power, which stabilized the airspeed at 178 knots.  However, the right bank and the resultant angle of attack (AOA) continued to increase, despite left aileron input by the autopilot.  As the autopilot reached the maximum input of 20 degrees, bank angle increased past 50 degrees, and the AOA increased rapidly from 7 degrees to 12 degrees.  At this point the stick shaker activated, the autopilot independently disconnected, the power was increased, and full left rudder was used to arrest the roll.  The bank angle reached 56 degrees, and the AOA reached 13.7 degrees at 177 knots.  The aircraft then pitched down, and entered a series of pitch, yaw, and roll maneuvers as the flight controls went through a period of oscillations for about 34 seconds.  The maneuvers finally dampened and the crew recovered at approximately 13,000 feet.  One passenger was seriously injured and one flight attendant received minor injuries during the upset.  According to wind tunnel and flight test data the A300 engineering simulator should adequately represent the aircraft up to 9 degrees AOA.  Unlike the accident aircraft; however, the simulator recovered to wings level promptly when the lateral control inputs recorded by the FDR were used. The roll disagreement between the simulator and accident aircraft began at 7 degrees AOA, and it appears that some effect not modeled in the simulator produced the roll discrepancy.  Just prior to the upset the accident aircraft entered a cloud deck.  The winds were approximately 240 degrees, 35 knots, and the ambient air temperature was approximately minus 4 degrees C.  An atmospheric disturbance or asymmetric ice contamination were two possible explanations considered, but unproven. ",

He reported that the airplane was about 2,000 feet above ground level in level flight and that the left propeller blades were not rotating. The accident site, located in an open field with obstacles, including rolling hills, woods, and roads, was about 6.5 miles from the private pilot\u2019s location. Evidence indicated that the airplane struck a tree in a near wings-level attitude. Larger fields and flatter terrain with fewer obstacles were located northwest of the apparent route of flight (the airplane\u2019s actual flight route was unknown), and, if the pilot had landed in one of these areas, he would have had a greater opportunity for a successful forced landing. However, the airplane was near or exceeded its maximum takeoff weight upon departure. According to the accident airplane\u2019s climb chart, the airplane was unable to maintain altitude when the left engine lost power due to its excessive weight and single-engine performance, the existing high-density altitude (2,963 feet), and, possibly, the pilot's execution of single-engine flight procedures, which left the pilot fewer options to reach a more suitable landing location.Evidence indicates that the left engine experienced a total loss of power. The spark plugs in the Nos. 1, 2, and 4 cylinders, which had fuel primer lines attached, exhibited carbon-fouling, indicating that a rich-fuel mixture existed at the time of the accident and that the pilot most likely unsuccessfully attempted to regain the left engine\u2019s power by using the fuel primer to prime the cylinders. The left wing gascolator bowl was removed and a blue silicon jell-type sealant was found covering about two-thirds of the area of the bowl's circumference and the area where a gasket is typically placed; however, no gasket was found in the gascolator. The blue silicon jell was consistent with Permatex Blue Silicon Gasket Maker, which has the following note in its directions: \"NOTE: Not recommended for use on head gaskets or parts in contact with gasoline.\" If the gascolator seal is breached, air can enter the fuel system and possibly unport the carburetor, which would cause an uncommanded engine shutdown due to fuel starvation. The pilot was also an airframe and powerplant mechanic with inspection authorization. He performed the last annual maintenance inspection of the airplane and subsequent aircraft maintenance. He likely improperly used the blue silicon sealant during maintenance operations.\u00a0Although the autopsy and toxicological examinations revealed that the pilot possibly had significant health issues, no evidence was found indicating that the pilot was incapacitated during the flight.\u00a0",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper decision to attempt to execute a forced landing to an open field with obstacles. Contributing to the accident was the left engine\u2019s total loss of power due to fuel starvation as a result of the introduction of air into the fuel system through a gascolator seal breach and the pilot\u2019s use of an improper substance on the left wing gascolator bowl during maintenance operations, which led to the gascolator seal breach."

During a straight-in approach for landing, the pilot lost all power on his left engine.  After switching to the left auxiliary tank the engine did not restart.  About a minute later all power was lost on the right engine.  No attempt was made to switch to the right auxiliary tank because the pilot felt the airplane was too low and he concentrated on making a forced landing on a city street directly in front of the airplane.  After touchdown, the airplane's wing tip main fuel tanks collided with the front ends of two approaching school buses.  The two main fuel tanks were ruptured in the accident and found empty. Only residual fuel was found in the lines, with 1 quart of fuel recovered from the left auxiliary tank and 4 gallons from the right auxiliary tank.  Investigators could not determine the exact fuel load onboard before the first departure that morning; however, based on refueling records, the airplane would have had no less than 122 gallons. During the first leg of flight, a high cylinder head temperature reading led the pilot to make a precautionary landing at an airport just over halfway to the original destination; the total elapsed time at this landing was 1.3 hours.  The pilot was then told to reposition the aircraft back to the point of departure.  He said he relied on a preplanned flight plan provided by company dispatchers, and he did not recompute the fuel required for the return.  No fuel was added before the return flight.  The elapsed time on the return flight was 1.2 hours for a total of 2.5 hours.  The pilot said that for both legs of the flight he set a fuel flow of 18 gallons per hour per engine (which is above the red line gage limit); the performance charts show that the proper fuel flow setting was 13.35 gallons per hour per engine.  Even at the high fuel flow of 18 gph, investigators computed that the airplane should have had a minimum of 12 gallons at the time of the accident, and this fuel remains unaccounted for.  The pilot said that at some point during the two legs he switched to his auxiliary tanks until the gauges read 2 and 5 gallons, and then switched back to his main tanks.  He could not specifically recall how long he had been flying on the mains when he switched tanks, or on which leg the switch occurred.  To avoid unwanted venting of fuel overboard, a specific fuel tank use sequence must be used.  The engine driven fuel pumps supply 50 percent more fuel than is required to the metering valves for each engine, with the excess fuel returned to the corresponding main tank.  The auxiliary tanks should not be selected until the main tanks have been used for at least 60 minutes so that the mains have room for the returned excess flow from the auxiliary tanks.  No evidence of leakage or staining was found around the wing filler caps.  Staining found on the pavement around both buses could not be differentiated between fuel and a fire suppressive agent.  After the accident, both engines were started and test run with no anomalies noted. ",

Further examination of the windshield showed that the glass exhibited thermal damage and sooting between the glass layers at the origination point of the cracks, along the lower edge of the heating element.  An examination of the hub seal, around the outer edge of the glass and aluminum frame showed evidence of deterioration.  There was evidence of water intrusion between the glass plies.  The intrusion damage extended along much of the lower edge of the windshield.  The windshield heating element was corroded  in the areas where water intrusion was observed.  The airplane maintenance manual states that the primary cause of moisture ingress is a deteriorated seal.  Moisture ingress eventually leads to one or all of the following:  delamination between the glass and interlayer, corrosion of the buss bar-heating wire junctions, failure of the electric heating system, and fracture of the outer glass ply.  Inspection of the seal is called for during each of six 200-hour Detail Inspections.  ",
            "probable_cause": "arcing of the windshield deicing system.  Factors contributing to the incident were the improper inspection of the windshield's exterior seal, deterioration of the windshield seal, and water penetration through the deteriorated seal."

The true airspeed fluctuated between a low of 88 knots to 102 knots during the last 45 seconds of flight. According to the aircraft manufacturer, the clean, wing flaps up stall speed was 78 knots. However, after a light rime encounter, the Pilot\u2019s Operating Handbook (POH) instructed pilots to maintain additional airspeed (10 to 20 KIAS) on approach \u201cto compensate for the increased pre-stall buffet associated with ice on the unprotected areas and the increased weight.\u201d With flaps up, a minimum approach speed of 105 KIAS was recommended.

The warning indicated that turbulence was reported by other flightcrews. The flight was dispatched with a cruise altitude of 13,000 feet msl due to the turbulence. According to the operator, based on a discussion with an air traffic controller the captain then changed the flight's cruise altitude to 15,000 feet msl to avoid turbulence. The seat belt sign was illuminated during the entire flight. During the beginning of the flight attendant's service, the aircraft experienced light turbulence. Halfway through the service, the aircraft experienced moderate turbulence. The flight attendant locked the cart and took a seat. The moderate turbulence dissipated after about a minute and the flight attendant completed the service. Following the service, the flight attendant was standing by the forward wardrobe closet and was thrown up into the ceiling and back to the floor. She sustained serious injury when she broke her nose and fractured her left wrist.

(The stringing of sock line is a Class C external load operation, meaning an operation in which the external load is jettisonable and remains in contact with land or water during the rotorcraft operation.)  The sock line was attached to the helicopter's remote cargo hook and played out of a truck mounted reel machine operating in the power payout mode.  The reel machine operator stated that \"suddenly the rope wrapped over another rope or pulled down in the drum, causing the rope to reverse on the drum.\"  The reel machine operator immediately moved the machine's shift lever from \"OUT\" to \"NEUTRAL,\" but by the time he had accomplished this, the rope between the reel and the helicopter went taut.  Numerous witnesses, who were all members of the line crew installing the wires, reported that when the rope went taut, the helicopter pitched up and rolled right.  The helicopter descended, impacted the ground and came to rest on its right side.  Post-accident interviews revealed that the pilot, the line crew, and company management did not adequately recognize and mitigate the risks inherent in the procedures they were using to conduct the sock line pull.  Specifically, the rigging used was a 25-foot long line with a 31-pound ballast weight, while other operators pulling sock line use longer long lines (50 to 100 feet) and heavier ballast (150 to 300 pounds) in order to provide pilots with an earlier warning of an impending shock load due to a snag so that the pilot will have more time to respond.  Additionally, at the pilot's request, the reel machine was being operated in the power payout mode, instead of the free wheeling mode.  This was due to a miscommunication between the pilot and the chief pilot, who stated that when he discussed the operation with the pilot, he assumed the pilot understood that he intended for the reel to be freewheeling.  In the freewheel mode, when a snag occurs, at worst, the reel stops.  In the power payout mode, when a snag occurs, the line can double back on the reel and begin to pull back in, as occurred in this accident.  Also, while preparing for the sock line pull, the line crew was paying out sock line on the ground and experienced a snag, which resulted in the line being pulled in instead of paying out, just as occurred in the accident.  However, there was no communication of this occurrence to the pilot.  Finally, although the pilot had 21,803 hours rotorcraft flight time, 16,000 hours in the accident make and model helicopter, and 4,000 hours conducting external load operations, his most recent Class C external load experience was 5 years and 3 months prior to the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "The reversal of the reel machine during a sock line pull which resulted in a loss of control while hovering out of ground effect.  Factors were the failure of company management to develop adequate procedures for conducting sock line pulls, the inadequate communication between the chief pilot and the pilot, the inadequate communication between the ground personnel and the pilot, and the pilot's lack of recent experience in Class C external load operations."

The private pilot was seriously injured and the passenger was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight departed St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport (PIE) about 1335 and was destined for FMY.In a telephone interview, the pilot stated the airplane's fuel tanks contained about 85 gallons of fuel prior to departure.

About 10 miles from FMY, the pilot contacted air traffic control (ATC), and he was instructed to report again at 4 miles from the airport. The pilot moved the fuel selectors from the auxiliary to main tank positions. At 4 miles from FMY, the pilot contacted ATC and configured the airplane for landing.On final approach for landing, at an altitude about 500 feet, the engine stopped producing power. The propeller continued to rotate, but the engine did not respond to throttle inputs. The pilot switched the fuel selectors back to the auxiliary tank position and turned on the electric fuel boost pumps, but never regained engine power. The pilot said that each time he moved the fuel selectors, he visually confirmed their position. The pilot performed a forced landing to a parking lot which resulted in substantial damage to the engine compartment and fuselage.Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed no odor of fuel, or evidence of fuel spillage at the scene; however, removal of the fuel caps revealed large quantities of fuel in each wing.

Spectrum analysis of air traffic control transmissions indicate that a propeller speed of 1,669 revolutions per minute was present following the loss of engine power.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed with recorded surface winds from the northeast.  Witnesses reported that they heard several attempted engine restarts while the airplane was being positioned for a forced landing on a 500-foot long fallow agricultural field north of a house.  A witness reported that black smoke would emanate from the airplane during each start attempt.  The airplane's wing and horizontal stabilizer contacted trees near the house resulting in a steep descent into the garage adjacent to the house.  A post crash fire/explosion then ensued.  The Airframe & Powerplant Mechanics Handbook states that a mixture \"too rich\" is indicated by black smoke.  Examination of the airplane systems and related components revealed that the turbocharger could not be rotated and a hydraulic press was utilized to effect the removal of the turbocharger turbine wheel.  The engine crankcase halves exhibited fretting, and the nut of one crankcase thru-bolt was not in place.  Maintenance records indicate that the crankshaft was replaced in response to airworthiness directives and service bulletins.  No other anomalies that would have precluded normal operation were found.  In 1994, the National Transportation Safety Board issued recommendation A-94-081 relating to emergency procedures for turbocharger failures to be included in airplane pilot operating handbooks (POHs) and airplane flight manuals.  The Cessna T206H POH does not list emergency procedures for turbocharger failures.  The Cessna T206H POH states, under emergency procedures, to advance the mixture control to the rich position if restart does not occur.  The manufacturer's airplane pilot safety supplement, which was reissued in 1998 to incorporate turbocharger failures, states that \"If a turbocharger failure results in a loss of power, it may be further complicated by an overly rich mixture.\"  A review of the emergency exit procedures in Cessna 206 models shows that with the flaps lowered, the forward portion of the cargo door can only be opened approximately 4 inches to allow the aft portion of the cargo door to be opened during emergency egress.

Examination of the ground scars and wreckage disclosed that the airplane collided with the berm in near wings level controlled flight while in a slightly nose high descending flight path.  Evidence showed that both engines were developing symmetrical high power at impact.  The aircraft was transporting cargo and medical specimens over a route the pilot flew every day according to a company schedule.  The aircraft had arrived at 1826 from the previous stop on the scheduled route.  According to witnesses at the airport who watched the airplane takeoff, either one or both of the engines were \"very rough sounding.\"  After the airplane departed runway 21, it made a shallow left turn, and then disappeared into the low clouds.  One witness indicated that the airplane rotated approximately 5,000 feet down the nearly 7,000-foot-long runway.  While on the ground after arrival, the pilot requested that the airplane be deiced.  The line service technician accomplished this at 1855, 1 hour before the accident, with the pilot observing the procedure.  When the technician arrived at the aircraft he noticed that the aircraft had \"a considerable amount of ice built up\" from the landing.  He sprayed approximately 5 gallons of Glycol mix 50/50 to remove the ice and snow that was attached to the leading edges of the wings, spinners, and the snow that had accumulated on the top of the fuselage.  During the procedure, light snow continued to fall.  The accident airplane was not certified, nor equipped for flight into known icing conditions.  Based on an evaluation of the weather data, IFR conditions, light snow showers, and conditions highly conducive to icing from the surface to 20,000 feet existed at the airport during the aircraft's landing, stay on the ground, and departure.  There was a 95 percent probability of moderate clear to mixed icing from the surface to 10,800 feet.  The pilot was aware of the icing conditions both at the airport and in the local area at the time of departure, and had received multiple weather briefings where the forecasted and observed icing conditions were clearly described.  The operator reported that a truck was available to take the pilot's cargo onto the final destination should weather or mechanical reasons preclude completion of the flight.  According to entries in a journal the pilot kept, there is evidence that the pilot perceived a great deal of pressure to fly in icing conditions with an under-equipped aircraft, and some of this pressure involved a perceived association between doing so and maintaining employment; however, there was insufficient information to determine whether the company culture condoned or encouraged this behavior.  There was insufficient information from which to determine why the pilot chose to depart in icing conditions.  Fatigue was not a factor in this accident.  No preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures were identified in the wreckage examinations.",

On the morning of the accident, the owner and an acquaintance drove to the facility to pick up the airplane with the intention of flying it back to its home airport. After landing at the home airport, they planned to pick up another pilot, who would then fly them back to the facility to pick up a car before returning the airplane to the home airport. The owner stated that he did not visually confirm the fuel quantity in the tanks, noting that the gauges had always been accurate and that he trusted the readings. The fuel quantity gauge for the left tank showed that it was about three-quarters full and the gauge for the right tank showed that it was nearly full. After departure, the owner found several discrepancies with the way the seats had been installed, and, after picking up the other pilot, they flew back to the maintenance facility. The owner and his passenger then left in their car while the other pilot waited for the seats to be fixed. The owner stated that, except for the seat issue, he detected no mechanical problems with the airplane. The manager of the maintenance facility said that after the annual inspection he started the airplane's engine and noted that it started without difficulty. The fuel selector was positioned to the left tank. He looked at the fuel gauges and recalled that the left wing tank's gauge was reading about one needle-width over the one-quarter full level and that the right tank's gauge was reading at or a little bit above one-half full. After the seat issue was resolved, the pilot left in the airplane. The manager did not know if the pilot performed a preflight inspection, but he is certain that the pilot did not use the ladder in the hangar to visually inspect the fuel tanks. Shortly after takeoff, the pilot radioed the tower controller and reported a total loss of engine power and that he was returning to the airport. The airplane impacted an embankment short of the runway. Within 5 minutes of the accident, pilots in a helicopter landed near the wreckage to offer assistance. The pilot who approached the wreckage said that there was no fuel smell present and that he observed no evidence of leaking fuel. The first emergency personnel to arrive at the accident site said that they observed no fuel leaking for the entire time they were on scene. They found the fuel selector valve positioned to the right fuel tank. Examination of the airplane revealed an estimated 10 gallons of fuel in the left wing's integral fuel tank and no fuel was present in the right tank. Drops of fuel were found in the engine's gascolator and in the fuel manifold valve. Several ounces of fuel were found in some fuel lines in the engine compartment, while other lines were dry. The findings of the fuel system examination were consistent with cavitation of the engine-driven fuel pump caused by air contamination in the pump\u2019s fuel supply line. The airplane was equipped with a panel-mounted instrument that records engine parameters. The data showed that, about 40 seconds prior to the engine\u2019s rpm decreasing, the fuel flow began to drop from 30 gallons per hour to zero. Coincident with the fuel flow decrease, the exhaust gas temperatures began a 250-degree rise before they also fell off. The recorded data were consistent with fuel starvation to the engine. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. The fuel tank quantity sending units in both tanks were examined, with no discrepancies noted.",

A person on the ground was in radio contact with the pilot and reported that the left main gear was collapsed.  At this time there appeared to be no other damage and the pilot decided to fly to another airport with a paved runway.  The pilot set-up for a landing in a \"full stall 2-point landing on the right side of the runway.\"  When the left side came down on the collapsed gear, the aircraft slid off the left side of the runway and turned about 45 degrees to the left before coming to a stop.

The pilot-rated student reported that while returning to the departure airport (KORL), he noted a smell of something burning which triggered him to look at the engine gauges; he noted \"...that we had no oil pressure.\"  No oil was noted by the student on the windscreen or on the sides of the airplane.  The flight continued towards KORL, and 5 minutes 3 seconds after an occupant first advised the controller of having no oil pressure, an occupant advised the controller that the engine quit.  The CFI took the controls and maneuvered the airplane towards a nearby golf course for a forced landing.  He made several s-turns to lose altitude with full flaps extended, but while maneuvering to possibly land on a nearby road, the airplane collided with power lines, then a power pole.  Postaccident, an oil film was noted on the exterior surface of the fuselage bottom skin, and in the engine compartment area on the aft side of the baffling.  During postaccident testing, a leak was noted from a flexible hose near the oil cooler end; the cure date of the hose was the 3rd quarter 1981.  Ten ounces of oil were drained from the engine, which exhibited internal evidence of oil exhaustion with resulting failure of the No. 2 cylinder connecting rod cap and bolt.  The engine was overhauled last in 2001.  The engine manufacturer recommends replacement of oil hoses at normal engine overhaul.  A note in the airplane maintenance manual indicates that rubber engine compartment hoses are to be replaced every 5 years or at engine overhaul, whichever occurs first.  Examination of the hose by the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed a .7 inch long crack located approximately 4.25 inches from the oil cooler adapter end.  The crack was oriented \"slightly away from the longitudinal axis.\"  Bench binocular microscope (BBM) examination of the hose revealed the woven fiber strands were missing in the cracked area.  Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and BBM examination of the face of the crack revealed the thickness of the outer layer of rubber was reduced, and a portion of the reduced outer layer of rubber that was located midspan of the crack was missing.  Additionally, the fiber strands that were located between the inner and outer rubber layers were fractured.  The inner layer of rubber was found to contain fracture lines that emanated from the outer surface layer in an area that contained an impression of fiber strands from the fibers between the 2 rubber layers.  The lines on the surface crack indicated that cracking of the inner layer propagated towards the inner diameter of the hose; cracking on a flat plane was noted to within .01 inch of the inside surface of the hose.  Examination of other areas of the inside surface of the hose revealed extensive longitudinal cracks.  Additionally, the exterior surface of the contained abrasion damage in three areas other than the cracked area of the hose; the abrasion damage did not extend through the outer layer of rubber.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the CFI to initiate a precautionary landing after noticing zero oil pressure with corresponding oil temperature increase, resulting in total loss of engine power due to oil exhaustion.  A contributing factor in the accident was the failure of company maintenance personnel to replace the flexible oil cooler hoses during engine installation following overhaul, as recommended by the engine manufacturer."
