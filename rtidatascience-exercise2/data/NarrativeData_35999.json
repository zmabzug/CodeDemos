The pilot then radioed that he was \u201c3 minutes out.\u201d About this time, the medical crew intubated the patient, and the communications center advised the pilot that two people were on the roof to assist him. He then observed two individuals on the rooftop helipad, which, \u201cwhile not abnormal,\u201d was \u201cnot routine.\u201d He was \u201ca bit concerned\u201d because he wanted to make sure the personnel were clear of the helipad before landing. The pilot recalled that he was somewhat more attuned to the patient\u2019s condition because the medical crew was working hard to keep the patient alive and was moving around the cabin unrestrained. He continued descending the helicopter on a straight-in approach and began the final approach to the rooftop helipad. About 100 yards from touchdown, he noticed something \u201corange\u201d out of the left window. At almost the same time, the flight paramedic mentioned that he also \u201csaw something orange.\u201d The pilot then felt a \u201cslight low frequency vibration,\u201d which was also noticed by the flight nurse. About 6 seconds later, he landed the helicopter on the helipad, executed an emergency shutdown, and then cleared the crew to exit.\u000b\u000bA contractor who was operating a construction crane near the heliport reported that he was lowering a piece of equipment onto the roof of a building when he observed a helicopter approaching. Another contractor then observed one of the helicopter\u2019s blades contact the flag marker, which was mounted on the top of the construction crane boom, and \u201cpieces of wood and flag\u2026flying all over the place.\u201d Examination of the helicopter confirmed that the main rotor had contacted the flag marker and that one of its blades was substantially damaged. According to the pilot, neither he, the flight nurse, nor the flight paramedic had seen the construction crane before the helicopter contacted it while approaching the helipad.\u000b\u000bReview of photographs taken after the accident revealed that the pilot\u2019s straight-in approach to the rooftop helipad passed over the location of the construction crane, which was positioned next to a nearby building. Flight crews had been notified of the construction crane\u2019s position 2 days before the accident, and the pilot believed that he had briefed the crew about the presence of the construction crane at the medical center. According to the notification, the crane was to be in position between about 0700 to 1000 local time and was going to have a beacon on top because of the proximity of the helipad. However, no beacon was installed, and the crane was still in use and in position 2 hours 21 minutes after the notification advised that the work was supposed to be completed. \u000b\u000bNo evidence was found indicating that the continued operation of the construction crane nor its presence was transmitted to the flight crewmembers when the flight was approaching the hospital. The investigation revealed that the communications technician was on the rooftop helipad at the time of the accident, not at her duty station manning the radio. The investigation also revealed that another helipad, which was located at ground level and was not near the construction crane, was available at the time of the accident and could have been used for the landing. \u000b\u000bIf the pilot had been provided with correct information about the construction crane\u2019s operation time and its presence or if he had used the available ground-level helipad, he would have been more likely to have avoided the crane. However, if the pilot had followed the guidance in the company\u2019s general operations manual, which required that a high-orbiting reconnaissance be completed before beginning the approach and that all published helicopter procedures for the heliport and helipad be observed (which in the case of the rooftop helipad designated a left traffic pattern), the accident could have been prevented. Instead, the pilot flew a straight-in approach, which placed the helicopter\u2019s flightpath near the construction crane, restricted his ability to see due to sun glare, and placed the helicopter in a position that obstructed his view of the construction crane, which would have been behind the instrument panel as the helicopter approached the rooftop helipad.\u000b\u000bThe National Transportation Safety Board has previously cited time pressure as a risk factor in HEMS flights. Due to the patient\u2019s critical condition, the pilot likely felt a sense of urgency to land, which influenced his decision to fly a straight-in approach to the rooftop helipad rather than to conduct a high-orbiting reconnaissance before initiating the approach. Although attempts are generally made to isolate HEMS pilots from the patient\u2019s condition while making go/no-go decisions, once onboard, it is difficult for pilots to be unaware of serious medical conditions that may be time critical, which leads to self-induced time pressures.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s decision to conduct a straight-in approach to the helipad, which resulted in the main rotor blade impacting a construction crane flag marker. Contributing to the accident was the erroneous information about the construction crane\u2019s operation time and the pilot\u2019s self-induced time pressure, which resulted from his awareness of the patient\u2019s medical situation during the flight."

The pilot was aware that the nearby airport had occasional aerobatic activity near the runway, within an \"aerobatic box.\" The box was active on the day of the accident, with a Notice to Airmen issued for aerobatic activity at 3,500 feet and below. The airplane approached the airport about 3,500 feet; however, the exact altitude could not be determined due to the fidelity of the radar/encoder data. As the airplane approached the airport at a high airspeed, likely about 190 knots, it collided with an aerobatic airplane that had just completed a hammerhead stall and was observed in a dive. The pilot's airplane cut through the aerobatic airplane's fuselage just aft of the cockpit, top to bottom, and lost about 4 feet of its left wing. The pilot's airplane then crashed into nearby woods, and the pilot of the aerobatic airplane parachuted into the same woods. The aerobatic pilot and an observer stated that clearing turns were conducted prior to the aerobatic maneuver. However, the sun\u2019s position and the airspeed of the oncoming airplane would have made it highly unlikely that the aerobatic pilot would have seen it. It is unknown what the inbound pilot's intentions were at the time of the accident. A relative of the inbound pilot, another pilot who had flown with him often, surmised that the pilot's approach to the airport at such a high altitude may have been an exploratory overflight, which is supported by the airplane's high airspeed at the time. Radar indicated that the pilot's airplane did not perform any standoff maneuvering prior to approaching the airport, and other pilots in the air at the time heard no advisory radio transmissions from him.

At that point the certified flight instructor (CFI) took over in order to demonstrate a landing on a different runway where there was a crosswind of about 10 to 12 knots at 90 degrees to the runway. The CFI made a successful touchdown on the main landing gear wheels, but as the airplane slowed and he began to lower the tail to the runway surface, the upwind wing was lifted by a gust of wind. When the CFI made control inputs to counter the lifting of the wing the opposite wing impacted the surface of the runway and the airplane veered toward the upwind runway edge. Before he could regain directional control, the airplane departed the right side of the runway, entered an area of soft terrain, and nosed over onto its back. According to the CFI, there was no evidence of a flight control malfunction prior to the accident.",

While flying at 9,000 feet, the pilot attempted to establish contact with Knoxville Approach Control, but the controller did not reply. About 28 seconds later, the pilot broadcast on the same frequency that he needed to declare an emergency because of a fire but did not specify the location or extent of the fire. There were no further recorded radio transmissions from the pilot, and his declaration of a fire was the first and only transmission describing any abnormal event. Primary radar returns for the airplane depicted a turn to the northeast then north after which the returns were no longer noted. The airplane crashed in a wooded area located about 61 degrees and 3,140 feet from the last primary radar return, using straight line distance. No determination could be made regarding the airplane\u2019s flightpath between the last primary radar return and the accident site; however, witnesses described seeing the airplane turn sharply to the right then hearing an explosion.Structural components consisting of the outer portion of the left wing, right wing outboard of the engine nacelle, vertical stabilizer, rudder, and both horizontal stabilizers were separated from the main wreckage, the farthest of which was located about 400 feet away. Examination of the fracture surfaces of the separated structural pieces revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. The cockpit, cabin, instrument panel, nose compartment, empennage, and inboard sections of both wings were nearly consumed by the postcrash fire. The right wing\u2019s upper skin between stations 105 and 115 exhibited fire damage but the lower wing skin just inboard and aft of the structurally separated area did not exhibit any fire damage. This indicates that the fire damage to the upper skin occurred after the lower skin piece separated.Examination of a recovered portion of the instrument panel glare shield revealed thermal damage concentrated around two openings on the right side of the glare shield\u2019s surface. The bottom surface of the glare shield had a distinct area of thermal damage; the damage extended from the forward most area on the right side all the way aft. The severity of the thermal damage was more pronounced in the middle of this area.Photographs of the combustion heater revealed a lack of extensive fire damage and insulation that still covered the conductor on several electrical wires. Further, the surrounding area of the airframe near the heater (for example, the nose landing gear door) did not exhibit extensive fire damage. Therefore, the combustion heater is an unlikely source of the pilot-reported in-flight fire, even though, according to the airplane\u2019s maintenance records, the combustion heater was beyond the recommended overhaul interval specified by the heater manufacturer.The airplane\u2019s maintenance records indicated compliance with a 2008 airworthiness directive (AD) requiring replacement of the circuit breaker toggle switches with switches of an improved design. The AD resulted from reports of overheating of certain circuit breaker toggle switches used in various electrical systems throughout the affected airplanes. Although a portion of the circuit breaker panel from the accident airplane was severely damaged by fire, it did not reveal any signatures consistent with electrical arcing or any other electrical anomaly.The time interval between the pilot\u2019s declaration of an emergency and the last radar return from the airplane was a little less than 1 minute, suggesting that the fire grew quickly without much of an incipient stage. These characteristics are consistent with a fuel-fed fire. Based on localized fire damage to the lower surface of the glare shield, the fire most likely occurred beneath the right side of the instrumental panel, an area that is near the direct-read oil pressure gauges. The exact source of the fire could not be determined because extensive fire damage precluded distinguishing between damage incurred in flight and postcrash.",
            "probable_cause": "An in-flight fire that mostly likely occurred in the right front cockpit area behind the instrument panel and below the glare shield; the origin of the fire could not be determined because of the extensive fire damage."

The left engine could not be restarted following a practice shutdown and feather.  Because the hydraulic pump is located on the left engine, the certified flight instructor was aware that the landing gear would have to be manually extended.  They elected to return to the departure airport while the private pilot undergoing instruction flew an instrument landing system approach.  The private pilot positioned the landing gear lever in the down position and pulled out the gear pump.  The instructor did not verify the landing gear lever's position and pumped the handle about 10 to 20 times but was not successful in getting a down-and-locked indication in the landing gear lights, nor did the landing gear selector handle return to the neutral position.  The instructor continued troubleshooting the airplane; however, the gear down-and-locked lights did not illuminate on any of the gear.  The air traffic control tower (ATCT) gave the airplane an instruction to conduct a 360-degree right turn at 500 feet above ground level (agl).  Prior to the entry into the turn, the instructor was considering the use of the Emergency Gear Extender; however, upon entry into the turn, control of the airplane demanded his full attention.  As they rolled out from the turn, the instructor asked the controller to confirm that the landing gear appeared to be down.  They replied affirmatively and the instructor took complete control of the airplane.  Just prior to the airplane's entry into the flare, someone blind transmitted over the radio that the nose gear did not appear down.  The instructor then applied power and the airplane rolled to the left and then impacted the ground.  According to the Piper Apache owner's handbook, the hydraulic pump is located on the left engine.  In the event of a power loss on the left engine, the hydraulic pump is rendered unusable.  In order to obtain hydraulic pressure in the event of a hydraulic pump failure or left engine failure, the emergency pump handle should be extended and 30 to 40 pumps are required to raise or lower the landing gear.  Upon full extension or retraction, the pump handle will position itself back into the neutral position.  In the event of a hydraulic system failure caused by a line breakage or a selector valve malfunctioning, the gear can be extended using the Emergency Gear Extender.  When this control is pulled, carbon dioxide flows from a cylinder under the floorboards and assists in extending the gear.  The Emergency Gear Extender control is located beneath a small cover plate underneath the left pilot's seat.  Post accident examination of the airplane and landing gear system showed that the landing gear lever was positioned close to the neutral position, rather than in the down position.  The emergency landing gear system was actuated through the hand pump and extended into the down-and-locked position with no operational anomalies noted.",
            "probable_cause": "the flight crew's failure to ensure that the landing gear lever was in the full down position prior to utilizing the hand pump, and the certified flight instructor's failure to utilize the blow down emergency landing gear system.  The instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight and failure to maintain Vmc during an attempted go-around was also causal."

Shortly thereafter, the airplane entered a left climbing turn, and the pilot engaged the autopilot. The flight director subsequently commanded a right roll and a decrease in pitch attitude. (The GPS steering command was set to navigate to a waypoint, and the shortest way to get there was a turn to the right.) The airspeed decreased to 105 knots and the bank angle was over 45 degrees left-wing low, so the aural underspeed alert activated because of the risk of stall. The nose-up pitch attitude decreased through level flight and entered a nose-down attitude; the left bank angle continued to increase. The underspeed alert ceased when the airplane reached an airspeed of 141 knots; the airplane was at a maximum left bank angle of 72 degrees and a maximum nose-down attitude of 24 degrees. Recorded data showed the engine was producing power throughout the flight and the autopilot was operating normally. An examination of the engine and airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operations. Given that the autopilot was set such that it would command a right turn when engaged, yet the pilot was instructed by the air traffic controller to turn left, it is likely that the pilot was overpowering the autopilot system to comply with the instructions.

The instructor was also required to be observant of the recently hired trainee's flying skill and provide any needed instruction.  On previous flights, the instructor had observed the trainee experiencing difficulty maintaining altitude during turns.  He also opined that the trainee was not strong enough to fully extend the wing flaps.  The trainee used two seat cushions behind her back to reposition her closer to the flight controls (and the instrument panel).  The instructor did not report his observations to management.  During the accident flight following a coyote shoot, the trainee entered a low altitude, slow airspeed, medium bank turn to reverse course.  During the turn, the instructor's attention was diverted to search the cabin floor for an ejected live shotgun shell.  The instructor looked outside the airplane just as the left wing impacted the level terrain in a nose low attitude.  The USDA operated the public-use airplane and directed the instructor to have it maintained by contract mechanics in accordance with FAA regulations.  Contrary to the airplane manufacturer's FAA type certificate, the USDA had erroneously connected the front seat shoulder harness, with its associated inertial reel, to the back of the front seat instead of using the prescribed factory mandated location at an overhead airframe hardpoint.  Additionally, the shoulder harness webbing was routed beneath seatback material.  An engineering analysis revealed that due to the anchoring of the harness to the seat structure rather than the prescribed airframe hardpoint, and the nose low ground impact trajectory, the inertial crash loads to the seat increased thus exceeding its designed strength.  The improper harness attachment combined with the compressive fuselage buckling resulted in the seat yielding in a forward bending direction.  The trainee's head impacted the instrument panel resulting in fatal injuries. The airplane had undergone four 100-hour and an annual inspection with the harness incorrectly attached. ",

After flying around the property and discussing how they could take the photographs, they landed and retrieved a camera from the \"chin area\" of the helicopter. The pilot then discussed with the passenger how he could fly along the borders of the property so the passenger could take the photographs he desired.

While at approximately 75 to 100 feet above ground level (AGL), while at an indicated airspeed of 78 knots, the pilot \"began increasing the [engine] throttle to maximum [power]\" to arrest a developing high rate of descent.  The engine reportedly did not respond.  Subsequently, the airspeed continued to decay and the airplane landed hard approximately 85 feet beyond the landing threshold.  The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane exited the edge of the 60-foot wide runway before coming to rest in the upright position.  Both pilots were able to egress the airplane unassisted.  An examination of the airplane's engine and flight controls did not reveal any pre-impact anomalies.  The wind at the time of the mishap was reported as variable at 6 knots, and the density altitude was estimated at 3,000 feet.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed during an emergency simulation resulting in a hard landing.  A contributing factor was the flight instructor's delayed remedial action."

As the airplane was on the downwind leg and almost abeam the runway identifier numbers, the engine power reduced and the nose pitched up about 15 degrees. The airplane made a tight turn onto the base leg and then overshot final approach. The airplane was high and appeared to be configured in a slip (right wing low) while approaching the runway. When reaching about 30 feet above ground level (agl), the airplane pitched nose high, as if the pilot was attempting to flare. The engine power slowly increased and the airplane turned about 45 degrees, barely clearing a hangar and power lines.

Examination revealed that the vertical fin attach tubes (forward and aft) had not been secured to the fuselage attach tubing. The bolts designed to secure the vertical fin to the fuselage were not attached; rather, the bolts were secured to the fuselage tubing and the undrilled vertical fin attach tubing was resting on top of the bolts.

The friend observed the airplane pitch down and enter a right spiral. He told the pilot to get the nose up. The spiral ceased and the nose began to come up, but not enough, so he again told the pilot to get the nose up. As the nose came up, he observed something red and silver come off the airplane; he believed these parts were the right elevator and one of the wing struts. The nose again dropped and the airplane spiraled toward the ground. As the airplane descended, the friend saw a wing break and instructed the pilot to get out of the airplane. The autopsy report stated that the pilot bailed out of the airplane; however, the ejection was too low for the pilot\u2019s parachute to open effectively and he sustained fatal injuries. The right elevator was found a quarter mile from the main wreckage. The left wing was found 75 to 80 feet from the main wreckage. Information provided by the pilot\u2019s wife revealed that the pilot purchased the airplane partially assembled, and completed its manufacture over five years. The airplane had accumulated about 52 hours of flight time at the time of the accident. An examination of the wreckage revealed that all structural failures were consistent with static, aerodynamic overload starting in the right elevator as a result of inputs to the flight controls. No evidence of substandard structure or fatigue was found.",

The flight was normal until it was time to land.  As the pilot descended to a large open grass field (where he has landed many times before), he told the passengers that they should bend their knees.  When the balloon was about 20 feet agl, a large gust of wind caused the balloon to descend rapidly with a forward motion until it hit the ground.  The impact was hard enough to eject four of the passengers and to break one of the burner can mounts, which caused it to point downward.  The balloon then caught fire as it ascended approximately 30 feet high with the pilot and one of the passengers still onboard.  The pilot said the he attempted to turn off the pilot light to the burner cans, but to no avail.  He told the passenger not to jump, because the balloon was now starting to descend.  The balloon then hit the ground again hard, and the pilot and the passenger were ejected.  The balloon then bounced a few more times as it traveled north towards rising terrain where it became fully engulfed in flames and was incinerated.  The pilot said that before the flight, he obtained weather information from the local airports and also released pilot balloons to determine wind direction.  The winds were calm at the beginning of the flight and then \"arced\" toward the north-northwest while en route; however, he did not know the speed of the wind.

Moments later the airplane came \"straight down\" and impacted the ground. During examination of the wreckage, it was discovered that that the fuel selector switch for the right engine had been in the \"X-FEED\" position during the accident. Examination of documents discovered in the wreckage revealed, three documents pertaining to operation of an Aerostar. These documents consisted of two airplane flight manuals (AFMs) from two different manufacturers, and a checklist. Examination of the first of the AFMs revealed, that it had the name of both the pilot and the operator on the cover of the document. Further examination revealed that it had been published 4 years prior to the manufacture of the accident airplane, and contained information for a Ted Smith Aerostar Model 601P, which the operator had previously owned. This document contained no warnings regarding the use of the crossfeed system during takeoff. Examination of the second of the two AFMs found in the wreckage revealed that it was the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved AFM for the accident airplane. Unlike the first AFM, the second AFM advised that the fuel selector \"X-FEED\" position should be used in \"level coordinated flight only.\" It also advised that each engine fuel selector \"must be in the ON position for takeoff, climb, descent, approach, and landing.\" It also warned that, if the airplane was not in a level coordinated flight attitude, \"engine power interruptions may occur on one or both engines\" when \"X-FEED\" is selected \"due to unporting of the respective engine's fuel supply intake port.\" Review of the checklist contained in the FAA approved AFM for the Piper Aircraft Model 601P under \"STARTING ENGINES,\" required a check of the crossfeed system prior to engine start by selecting each fuel selector to \"ON,\" then selecting \"X-FEED,\" and after verifying valve actuation and annunciator light illumination, returning the fuel selector to \"ON.\" Additionally, under \"BEFORE TAKEOFF\" It also required that the fuel selectors be checked in the \"ON\" position, and that the \"X-FEED\" annunciator light was out, prior to takeoff. Examination of the pilot's checklist revealed that, it consisted of multiple pages inserted into plastic protective sleeves and included both typed, and hand written information.

The passenger reported that the pilot immediately decided to return to the airport because of the approaching storm.  Witnesses reported seeing the airplane banking erratically while on approach to runway 18 and one witness stated the airplane \"turned on its left side and went behind the trees.\"  The airplane impacted left wing first approximately 36 feet off the left side of runway 18.

The on-site inspection of the airframe, engine, and related systems did not reveal any evidence of pre-impact malfunction.  The passenger reported that the pilot did not verify weather conditions prior to departure and that the approaching storm was not visible from the airport.  The airport is located in a valley which is flanked by higher elevation to the west and east.  A Convective SIGMET was current at the time of the accident and encompassed the accident location.

Witnesses described hearing no reduction of engine noise from takeoff power to climb power.  The airplane entered a steep left bank about 200 feet above the water, then rolled rapidly to the right and impacted at a steep angle into the water. The airplane had been modified with a Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) kit.  Certification flight tests had determined that this modification eliminated aerodynamic warning of impending stalls, and therefore required an audible stall warning.  Test results also required the addition of both a ventral fin, and horizontal stabilizer finlets, to meet directional stability certification.  These tests determined that the least stable condition was in the takeoff flap configuration, during climb.  The Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for the modification required the ventral fin, and an audible stall warning system be installed.

He saw smoke coming out of the engine cowl and oil began to splatter onto the windshield. As the airplane started to descend, the pilot maneuvered the airplane to land in a plowed field. After touchdown, the pilot intentionally ground-looped the airplane to avoid striking a canal bank, resulting in collapsed landing gear and substantial damage to the wing and empennage structures.
