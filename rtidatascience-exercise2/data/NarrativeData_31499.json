According to the FAA transcript of communications, the pilot had twice requested progressively lower altitudes to maintain VFR. The controller approved the second request for a lower altitude, but told the pilot that at that altitude Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) might not be able to maintain radar contact with his aircraft at that low an altitude. The pilot's third request was for 7,500 feet to avoid turbulence, and at 1619 the pilot changed his destination from Tri-cities Regional Airport to Hawkins County Airport. At 1622:39 the pilot reported to that he was descending out of five thousand three hundred feet. The controller acknowledged, providing the local altimeter setting for the nearest weather reporting station, the Tri-Cities Airport. At 1622:50 the pilot acknowledged the Tri-cities altimeter setting, stating, 'three zero two six roger.' At 1628.26 the controller said, 'niner seven four zero yankee radar contact lost squawk one two zero zero cleared to advisory frequency good afternoon'. The controller made one last transmission at 1628:26, saying 'niner seven four zero yankee Atlanta.' There were no further communications with the pilot of N9740Y.

During the approach, the pilot provided guidance and corrections to the copilot.  The copilot flew the airplane to within 200 feet of the ground when the nose of the airplane yawed abruptly to the right.  The pilot took control of the airplane, and pushed the engine and propeller controls to the full forward position.  He placed the fuel pump switches to the \"high\" position, retracted the flaps, and attempted to retract the landing gear.  With full left rudder and full left aileron applied, he could neither maintain directional control nor stop a roll to the right.  The airplane struck the ground and continued into the parking area where it struck an airplane and a waste-oil tank.  Examination of the airplane following the accident revealed that the landing gear was down and locked, and the propeller on the right engine was not feathered.  The emergency procedure for an engine inoperative go-around required landing gear retraction and a feathered propeller on the inoperative engine.  The pilot's handbook further stated, \"Climb or continued level flight is improbable with the landing gear extended and the propeller windmilling.\"  After the accident, both pilots stated that they didn't notice a power loss on the right engine until the copilot surrendered the flight controls.

The pilot reported that the engine lost partial power during the initial climb after takeoff and that there was not enough runway left to put the airplane back down and stop. However, the witness observations indicate that the airplane was likely not developing full power during the takeoff ground roll and the pilot should have been able to abort the takeoff if he had recognized that the engine was laboring earlier in the takeoff roll. Within the 4 months preceding the accident, the airplane had undergone maintenance because the engine was running rough. The maintenance included cleaning of the fuel injectors and fuel screens, overhaul of the fuel servo and the fuel flow divider, and installation of new fuel injector lines.

Several eyewitnesses observed the glider descending in a steep spiral turn toward the ground. The glider collided with high voltage transmission wires and terrain in a sparsely wooded area. An examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact anomalies with the glider. Testing of the glider\u2019s oxygen bottle, regulator, and mask detected no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the oxygen system. A review of audio recordings revealed that the pilot\u2019s radio transmissions did not have the muffled sounds normally associated with the use of an oxygen mask, suggesting that the pilot may not have been wearing the oxygen mask during a portion of the flight. According to Federal Aviation Administration guidance, on average, a pilot can operate at 22,000 feet msl for about 5 to 10 minutes before losing consciousness due to a lack of oxygen (hypoxia); the glider was above 22,000 feet msl for 13 minutes 36 seconds. Therefore, it is possible that the pilot became incapacitated due to hypoxia. Additionally, the pilot, who was diabetic and routinely self-tested his blood sugar levels, recorded a blood sugar level of 58 mg/ml about 1 hour 40 minutes before the flight; according to the U.S. Library of Medicine, a blood sugar level below 70 mg/dl is considered low (hypoglycemia).  Although it is likely that the pilot addressed the low blood sugar level by eating or taking glucose tablets, his blood sugar level at the time of the accident is unknown.  Hypoxia and hypoglycemia have similar symptoms including headache, blurred vision, tingling or numbness, and unclear thinking, and both conditions can lead to loss of consciousness if they are not promptly remedied. There was no record of the pilot being trained to recognize hypoxia symptoms, and it is possible that he may have mistaken the symptoms of hypoxia for hypoglycemia. It is likely that the pilot became incapacitated and lost control of the glider; however, it could not be determined if the pilot's incapacitation was a result of hypoxia, hypoglycemia, or a combination of the two conditions.",

After being notified of the deviation, the pilot responded that he was attempting to look at his contrails.  Later in the flight, after leveling at FL270, the pilot queried ATC as to whether they had heard some of his previous calls.  This was the last transmission received from the pilot, and attempts to reestablish contact were unsuccessful.  After the pilot had not begun his descent for landing, nor joined the arrival course for his destination, ATC requested assistance from the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).  After intercepting the airplane, the pilots of the fighter airplanes attempted to look into the cockpit, but were unable to see the pilot.  Attempts to gain his attention were also unsuccessful.  The airplane eventually descended and impacted terrain.  A nasal cannula was connected to the airplane's installed oxygen system and was found near the pilot.  An oxygen mask the pilot was wearing was connected to a portable oxygen bottle found on the floor next to him.  Both systems were functional, their valves were open, and both were depleted of their contents.  The portable bottle was manufactured for industrial use, and modified with an oxygen system fitting.  The regulator was manufactured for the medical industry.  A review of a journal kept by the pilot revealed that he flew at high altitudes for efficiency, and used an oximeter to monitor blood oxygen.  He used a nasal cannula at altitudes exceeding 18,000 feet for comfort, and had used a \"cannula and mask\" up to 31,000 feet.  Examination of his hangar revealed an aircraft oxygen tank and welding tank plumbed to an oxygen-service fitting.  The airplane's oxygen system or portable bottle had not been serviced at the airports the airplane operated from during the trip.  According to Advisory Circular (AC) 61-107A, \"Operations of Aircraft At Altitudes Above 25,000 Feet MSL And/Or Mach Numbers (MMO) Greater Than .75\", preflight inspections should include a thorough examination of aircraft oxygen equipment, \"including available supply,\" and that \"Oxygen systems should be checked periodically to ensure that there is an adequate supply of oxygen and that the system is functioning properly.  This check should be performed frequently with increasing altitude.  If supplemental oxygen is not available, an emergency descent to an altitude below 10,000 feet should be initiated.\"  Additionally, it advised that when using continuous flow oxygen systems above 25,000 feet, \"very careful attention to system capabilities is required.\"",

The ramp agent instead filled the left tank close to capacity and did not put any fuel in the right tank. The pilot was not aware of the discrepancy, and during the preflight inspection, he checked the fuel tank levels using the wing-mounted sight gauges. However, he misread the right tank quantity and continued the preflight inspection even though the fuel quantity gauges in the cabin did not match the sight gauges. The sight gauge design allows for the display of fuel quantity only when the tank is filled to between 25 and 35 gallons (about 1/2 to 3/4 full). However, when the tank is filled to 1/4 of its capacity or less, the tail of the gauge needle points to the 32 gallon (3/5 capacity) position. This most likely accounted for the pilot\u2019s misinterpretation of the fuel level.During the initial climb, with the right fuel tank selected, the engine lost all power. The pilot failed to recognize the fuel starvation condition and performed troubleshooting steps by memory before ultimately switching the fuel tank selector valve to the left tank, which was full. The pilot\u2019s troubleshooting procedures included multiple activations of the auxiliary fuel pump on HI mode, which, according to the airplane manufacturer\u2019s emergency checklist, was not the appropriate action for a fuel starvation condition. The use of the pump resulted in an excessively rich fuel mixture when the left tank was selected and prevented the engine from being restarted. The pilot then switched back to the empty fuel tank and performed a gear-up forced landing into a plowed field.",

He did not file a flight plan or obtain a weather briefing prior to departure. About 4 minutes after departing, the pilot contacted air traffic control and stated the weather was worse than he anticipated. He requested an instrument clearance and approach back to his departure airport. The airplane was radar identified, the pilot was instructed to climb to 2,000 feet and then proceed direct to an intermediate fix. The pilot acknowledged the clearance and there was no further communication between him and the controller. A review of radar data revealed the airplane was first observed at 700 feet mean sea level, in a climbing right turn. It continued to climb while turning to the left and right, to 1,100 feet. The airplane was last observed by radar at 700 feet in a descending right turn.A witness stated he observed the airplane flying below a cloud layer estimated between 500 to 1,000 feet agl, with the strobe lights on. He described the area as very dark with no ambient light. Another witness stated he observed the airplane in straight and level flight, flying in and out of the clouds. The pilot's last recorded night flight was 14 months prior to the accident, and no flights had been conducted in the accident airplane. The pilot obtained an instrument rating 2 months before the accident and he had flown 4.5 hours of actual instrument flight time; of which, 1 hour was in another model airplane. The pilot had logged 15 minutes of instrument flight time in the accident airplane. At the time of the accident, the moon's phase was \"waxing crescent\" with 18 percent of the disk illuminated. If neither horizon nor surface references exist, the attitude of an airplane must be determined by artificial means from the flight instruments. However, during periods of low visibility, the supporting senses sometimes conflict with what is seen, and when this happens, a pilot is particularly vulnerable to spatial disorientation. Federal Aviation Administration guidance indicates that spatial disorientation can occur when there is no natural horizon or surface reference, such as a night flight in sparsely populated areas similar to that of the accident area and conditions. Based on the wreckage and the visual reference conditions present at the time of the accident it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation.Examination of the airframe, flight controls, engine assembly and accessories revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies.",

The briefer also informed the pilot that flight under visual flight rules (VFR) was not recommended; however, the pilot elected to depart under VFR. Although no radar data exists for the flight, the location of the accident site was consistent with the pilot having flown the airplane toward the Talladega National Forest, an area where the pilot frequently flew. After the pilot failed to arrive at his destination, a search was initiated, and the wreckage was located on October 11, 2006, at 1340, on Burgess Peak, at an elevation of 1,787 feet mean sea level. The airplane first impacted the top of a tree on the south side of Burgess Peak on a 300-degree heading.

The pilot in the front seat, who was flying the airplane, attempted to troubleshoot the engine issue, including activating the carburetor heat; however, the engine continued to run roughly, so he chose to divert to a nearby airport. The rear-seat pilot then took control of the airplane. While on final approach to the runway, the rear-seat pilot asked the front-seat pilot, who was seated near the wing flap control, to configure the flaps for landing. After the flaps fully extended, they retracted. The rear-seat pilot then asked the front-seat pilot to re-extend the flaps. About this time, the rear-seat pilot noticed that people and vehicles were at the end of the runway and chose to abort the landing by increasing engine power and turning the airplane toward an adjacent field.

While in flight at 8,500 feet mean sea level, the pilot heard a loud noise and the engine started running rough.  He started to divert to a nearby airport when there was another loud bang from the engine compartment; engine rpm dropped dramatically, and the cockpit started to fill with white smoke.  He was being vectored to a nearby airport when the cowling popped open and remained open, substantially increasing the airplane's rate of descent.  The pilot set up to land in a vineyard by lowering the airplane's landing gear and approaching the field at 45 degrees to the vineyard rows.  He started the landing at 75 knots when the left main landing gear snagged a grape vine row pole and wires.  The plane veered to the left, and stopped almost immediately.  He recalled that his head hit the dashboard during the landing and his passenger in the right seat was unconscious after the landing.  Shoulder harnesses or straps were not installed on this airplane, only lap belts.  The calculated landing decelerating force was about 19.5 g's, which resulted in both occupants receiving serious head injuries.  Post accident examination of the engine revealed that the number 4 cylinder had departed the engine along with the piston.  The engine case halves were fractured directly above the number 4 cylinder location.  The two upper right cylinder hold down studs were present and appeared undamaged, while the bottom studs were sheared across their diameter above the engine case, and left-hand side studs were sheared across their diameters at the engine case surface.  The number 4 cylinder base pad surface of the crankcase exhibited fretting at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions.  This condition is consistent with the right-hand and bottom cylinder hold down nuts backing off during engine operation allowing the number 4 cylinder to move in rhythm with the piston until the remaining cylinder studs on the left side failed under the cyclic load.  The backing off of the cylinder hold down nuts would not normally occur if the nuts had been properly torqued when installed.  The number 2, 4, 5, and 6 cylinders had been removed and replaced or reinstalled 186.2 hours prior to the accident.  The under-torqued cylinder hold down nuts were not detected during the 100-hour inspection that was performed 88.1 hours prior to the accident.",
            "probable_cause": "the separation of the number 4 engine cylinder due to improperly torqued cylinder hold down nuts.  A finding in this accident was the lack of a shoulder restraint system in the airplane, which contributed to the occupants' injuries."

The pilot recorded about 7.8 hours in two-seat gyroplanes and had no experience in single-seat gyroplanes. On the day of the accident flight, the pilot was anxious to fly the gyroplane before traveling to the northeast for the summer. During his first flight in the single-seat gyroplane, the pilot had just crossed the approach end of runway 14 when the gyroplane pitched down 30 degrees, then pitched up 45 degrees, and subsequently descended to the ground. Witnesses, who were personal friends of the accident pilot, noted that, in their opinion, the pilot was not experienced enough to fly his gyroplane solo. One witness also stated that he was going to test fly the gyroplane for the owner2 days before the accident flight but was unable due to inclement weather . According to the inventor of the gyroplane, and based on his analysis of the accident flight details, the engine power was reduced with the control stick positioned slightly aft of center and that it appeared that the pilot decreased power and airspeed just before entering a vertical descent to the ground. \u000b\u000bToxicological testing revealed therapeutic levels of diphenhydramine (for example, Benadryl) in the pilot\u2019s blood samples. Diphenhydramine is a sedating antihistamine that could impair a pilot\u2019s cognitive and psychomotor performance. The diphenhydramine in cavity blood (0.038 ug/ml) was slightly above the lower limit of the normal therapeutic range (0.0250 to 0.1120 ug/ml). Diphenhydramine undergoes significant postmortem redistribution; as a result, it is likely that the pilot\u2019s diphenhydramine level was most likely at or below the lower therapeutic level about the time of the accident. Therefore, it is unlikely that impairment from diphenhydramine degraded the pilot\u2019s ability to safely operate the gyroplane. The clinical findings of an elevated hemoglobin A1C (9.2%) and elevated glucose in the urine is consistent with poorly controlled diabetes. The hemoglobin A1C of 9.2% correlates with an average blood sugar level of about 250 mg/ml (below 140 mg/ml is normal). Blood sugar elevated into this range causes few identified symptoms other than increased urination and is not acutely impairing. However, long-term diabetes can cause loss of vision, neuropathy in the lower limbs, and kidney disease. The investigation could not determine if the pilot had any symptoms from diabetes or its long-term complications.\u000b\u000bExamination of the airframe, engine, and flight control system components revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.

He reported that he conducted a preflight inspection and noted no anomalies. Immediately after takeoff, the ultralight began to oscillate up and down with no elevator input. The pilot stayed in the traffic pattern, and the oscillations continued at different altitudes and airspeeds. During landing, the ultralight touched down about 45 knots with upward oscillations. The pilot decided to take off again and experiment with different trim settings. Upon liftoff, the ultralight again began to oscillate with no throttle or elevator inputs. The pilot decided to depart the traffic pattern to further experiment with the trim and power settings; however, different trim and power settings had no effect on the oscillations. The pilot indicated that the oscillations were random, so he could only react to the direction with flight control corrections and could not anticipate which flight control corrections would be needed. The pilot reentered the traffic pattern for landing and, during the landing, when the ultralight was about 5 feet above the ground and at 40 knots, the oscillations began again.

Thereafter, the airplane entered a spin and impacted the ground while in a 30- to 45-degree nose low pitch attitude.  The impact site was 0.6 miles from the approach end of the runway.  Pilots ahead and behind the airplane reported experiencing moderate to extreme turbulence in the traffic pattern.  The surface wind was reported at 14 knots with gusts to 22 knots.  At the time of the accident the airplane was calculated to be between 94 and 127 pounds over its maximum certificated 1,400 pounds gross weight.  During the on scene wreckage examination, the left wing's rear spar attachment fitting was found severely corroded, with missing rivet heads and was separated. Metallurgical examination of the severely corroded spar attachment fitting revealed the presence of rivet heads that had failed and popped off in flight and an associated corrosion-related crack that had compromised the structural integrity of the fitting assembly.  Unable to sustain the imposed wing loading, the fitting failed in flight.  The failed rivet heads and evidence of the corrosion was on the backside of the spar in an area not visible during inspections.  In 1995, a one-time visual inspection of the wings' internal structure for corrosion was mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration through issuance of Airworthiness Directive 94-18-04.  This 'one time' visual inspection requirement was complied with according to a logbook entry dated 1997, and thereafter the wings were recovered with fabric.  In May 1998, the pilot purchased the airplane, which had been manufactured in 1948.  In September 1998, the airplane received another annual inspection during which no logbook entry was made indicating that the wing's internal structure had been reexamined for evidence of corrosion.  The corrosion developed due to the presence of moisture and the dissimilar metals (steel bracket riveted to an aluminum spar) being in contact with each other.  The severity of the ongoing corrosion process between the metal components would not have been evident during an external visual inspection, despite the fact that a required access panel had not been installed pursuant to the AD.  The AD inadequately addressed the aging aircraft issue by indicating compliance could be achieved through performance of a one-time visual inspection to ferret out nonviewable evidence of internal corrosion. ",

The failure resulted from severe corrosion that was undetected during performance of an inspection specified by an airworthiness directive.  The airworthiness directive developed by the FAA was deficient in its specificity relating to recurrence.  The directive was also deficient in its procedure requiring external inspection, which would not reveal development of internal corrosion.  Contributing factors to the accident were the turbulent atmospheric condition that exacerbated the wing loading and the pilot's operation of the airplane in excess of maximum authorized gross weight.

The pilot applied the brakes a second time, and the right main landing gear tire subsequently failed. The airplane departed the end of runway 36 and came to rest in an area of unfinished gravel, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe. Examination of the 4,954-feet-long runway revealed that the airplane touched down about 1,400 feet from the approach end. Skid marks were visible for about 2,982 feet, and the tire failure occurred about 3,153 feet into the landing. Examinations revealed that the right main landing gear tire had a flat spot with a 4-inch diameter hole consistent with a locked brake. The airplane was equipped with an optional antiskid wheel braking system; however, it was disabled in 2004.The pilots reported that they decided to land on runway 36 based on the wind at flight level 180 and that they did not check the surface wind at the airport. The surface wind at the airport at the time of the accident was from 158 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 25 knots. Thus, the airplane landed with a significant quartering tailwind, which resulted in it touching down at a location and speed at which the pilots were unable to stop the airplane on the runway using normal braking.",

While performing an aerial survey, about 100 feet agl, the engine-out annunciator sounded, and the pilot entered an autorotation.  As the helicopter touched down in a small clearing, the pilot had the collective pitch control full up to cushion the landing.  When the helicopter touched down, the engine power suddenly surged, and the helicopter then began to climb.  During the pilot's efforts to control the helicopter, the main rotor blades collided with several trees, and the blades then severed the tail boom.  Following the collision with the trees, the pilot rolled the throttle to the off position, but the engine would not shut-down.  He then pulled the emergency fuel shut off.

The bellcrank is connected to the helicopter's collective control linkage.

No scale was available at the aircraft, forcing loaders to rely on tallying either waybill weights or estimates of total cargo weight and center of gravity (CG) during the brief loading period. Additionally, a strike had shut down a major cargo competitor at the time with substantial cargo overflow to the operator. Post-crash examination determined the cargo load was 656 pounds greater than that documented on the pilot's load manifest, and the CG was between 6.8 and 11.3 inches aft of the aft limit. The airplane behaved normally, according to the pilot, until he initiated full flaps for landing approaching the threshold of runway 34L at the Seattle-Tacoma International airport. At this time, the aircraft's airspeed began to decay rapidly and a high sink rate developed as the aircraft entered into a stall/mush condition.

The pilot said that as he was adding back pressure to flare the airplane his control wheel fractured and separated at the upper left corner.  The airplane's nose dropped rapidly and impacted the runway surface first, resulting in the airplane bouncing back into the air.  The pilot repositioned his hand behind the broken wheel to the control column and manipulated the broken control yoke forward in an effort to maneuver the airplane back down to the runway surface; the nose landing gear bent and the propeller impacted the runway.  The airplane was manufactured in 1962 and equipped with a polymeric control wheel.  A metallurgical examination of the fracture surface on the control wheel revealed smooth crack arrest markings along with bands of slightly different colors, indicative of fatigue cracking.  The location of the fracture indicated that the fatigue crack propagated as a result of tensile stress from the continual force of the pilot manipulating the control wheel forward and aft.  The discoloration and crazing gave evidence of aging effects.  The fatigue cracks likely initiated from age related crazed cracks in an area of maximum tensile stresses.  The dirt and discoloration of the fracture (and the adjacent cracks and/or crazes), along with the depth of the fatigue crack would suggest that the crack has been in existence for a relatively long time (years, perhaps).  Although the fatigue crack would not have been visible from the pilot's viewpoint, it occurred in an area where cracking would be most likely to occur based on the geometry of the yoke.  The airplane underwent its last annual inspection 17.76 hours prior to the accident.  The airplane manufacturer issued a Service Letter in1964 requiring a one time inspection and proof testing of applicable control wheels.  The Service Letter further stated that once control wheels were checked, no further control wheel inspection was required.  To show compliance with the Service Letter, a red dot was to be placed on the forward rivet butt on the bottom of the yoke.  Both control wheels installed on the accident airplane showed evidence of a red material within the forward rivet butt, indicating that the inspections dictated by the Service Letter were previously preformed.  The Federal Aviation Administration issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) in 2001 recommending that during periodic (100-hour or annual) inspections \"special emphasis\" should be placed on the original plastic control wheels installed in applicable airplanes.  If crack indications were \"unclear,\" it recommended that a test be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's Service Letter.  The SAIB does not provide a specific location or guidance as to the visual indicators where the cracks are likely to propagate.  A review of the Service Difficulty Report (SDR) database revealed a history of 18 control wheel failures in the applicable airplanes, of which a majority reported failures that occurred during a critical phase of flight, including: takeoff, initial climb, spin recovery, and landing flare.  Five of the reported failures occurred after the issuance of the SAIB.",

He asked that 8 gallons of fuel be added; however, according to the fixed base operator\u2019s records the airplane was serviced with only 6 gallons. En route to his destination, the pilot received flight following service from air traffic control (ATC). While enroute, the pilot told controllers that he was concerned about his fuel and inquired as to the fuel services nearby. He asked for and received vectors to a nearby airport. Unable to find the airport, the pilot tried unsuccessfully to contact ATC several times. The pilot then decided to make an off-airport landing. Another aircraft advised controllers that the pilot was making an emergency landing \"due to fuel exhaustion.\" The pilot said that the engine lost power prior to landing. During the landing on rough terrain, the landing gear was sheared off from the composite fuselage. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector questioned the pilot as to why he didn\u2019t land for fuel at Raton, New Mexico. His reply was that he had never landed at that airport before and was unfamiliar with it. Asked if he had ever landed at Trinidad, the pilot said no. FAA inspectors who examined the airplane reported that the fuel quantity can either be checked with the fuel gauge or by examining the clear plastic tubing that shows the fuel level. An examination of the fuel gauge found it to be operating normally. No other anomalies were found; however, the engine manufacturer issued a mandatory Service Bulletin (SB) calling for replacement of the airplane's fuel pump. The SB notes that in limited cases a deviation in fuel supply can occur causing engine malfuntion or massive fuel leakage.",

The pilot ultimately aborted the rejected takeoff, but during his attempt to bring the airplane to a stop it nosed over in rough terrain off the side of the runway. The investigation revealed that there was a lack of free rotational movement (binding) in the right main gear brake assembly. The wheel was hard to turn by hand, with the resistance to free movement due to the pressure being applied to the brake rotor by the new brake pads that were installed about three to four flight hours prior to the accident. A postaccident interview with the mechanic who installed the pads determined that after the installation of the pads, the wheel was not jacked up off of the ground so that free movement of the rotor and wheel could be established. Instead, the determination of free movement was made based upon the fact that no resistance was noted when the airplane was pushed out of the hangar by hand. At the time the airplane was rolled out of the hangar the brake rotor was at ambient temperature.

The private pilot, who was the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The aircraft was registered to Tucano Flyer LLC, and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan had not been filed. The flight originated from Camarillo Airport (CMA), Camarillo, California, at 0810. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the pilot was in contact with the SoCal Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and was receiving advisories while maneuvering over the Chumash Wilderness area. Radar reviewed by NTSB investigators depicted multiple turns, rapid changes in altitude, and airspeed. At 0925 radar contact was lost and no other communication was received from the pilot.  Examination of the accident site revealed that the wreckage was located in a dry creek bed. The airplane was destroyed by high impact forces and a postimpact fire. The debris field was 641 feet in length and  355 feet wide. A large crater about 11 feet in diameter and 5 feet deep, was found at the beginning of the debris field.
