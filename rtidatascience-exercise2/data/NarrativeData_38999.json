Approach control vectored the pilot 14 miles back to the airport where he had previously completed an instrument approach.  The pilot reported the runway in sight, however, the aircraft crashed on final approach 2 miles from the runway.  A witness reported hearing the aircraft's engine as it approached, followed by 5 seconds of silence, and then the sound of impact.

During the inspection, the Nos. 1, 3, and 4 cylinders were removed from the engine and repaired.  Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that one of the two valve keepers had not been reinstalled on the No. 3 cylinder exhaust valve resulting in asymmetric loading of the remaining keeper.  When that keeper fractured, the exhaust valve was released and entered the combustion chamber of the No. 3 cylinder where it contacted the piston.

The pilot stated that upon landing the aircraft began pulling to the left.  He reported that he applied full right rudder and right brake.  However, the aircraft began tracking toward the left side of the runway and subsequently departed the pavement.  The aircraft encountered a small ditch and the left main landing gear collapsed.  A local pilot reported observing the aircraft's approach and thought that it was slightly high and fast.  She also recalled hearing one, louder than normal \"chirp\" of the tires on the runway during landing touchdown, leading her to think the pilot had made a \"hard 3 point landing.\"  The president of the flying club from which the pilot had rented the aircraft reported having a conversation concerning the accident with the pilot.  He commented to the pilot that, during a crosswind landing situation in the model aircraft involved, it \"would be easy to push with the toes to lock the brake.\"  The pilot reportedly responded that \"that was probably the case.\"  A post-accident inspection revealed the left main landing gear had collapsed and damaged the left wing.  The left main tire had a hole worn through the tread area.  The brake system on the left main landing gear was examined.  No anomalies consistent with a pre-impact failure were observed.  The runway exhibited tire marks beginning approximately 1,400 feet from the threshold and continuing, virtually uninterrupted, to the point the aircraft departed the pavement.  The marks in the grass continued from that point to the aircraft's resting position in the ditch.  The initial skid mark was associated with the left main landing gear.

The skid mark produced by the left main gear tire changed to a set of two parallel marks characteristic of a flat tire.  At this point, the mark indicated that the aircraft began tracking toward the left side of the runway and was continuous until it left the pavement.  A single, continuous skid mark associated with the right main landing gear tire began about the time the aircraft started tracking to the left.",

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the cross-country flight, which departed from Lawrence Municipal Airport (LWM), Lawrence, Massachusetts about 1000 and was destined for Dillant-Hopkins Airport (EEN), Keene, New Hampshire. The instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.In his written statement, the student pilot reported that he had been cruising at an approximate altitude of 2,500 feet mean sea level, on VFR flight following to remain under a cloud ceiling. Halfway through the flight, the pilot noticed that the ceilings were lower than anticipated and decided to return to LWM. He turned the airplane around and two minutes later the engine rpm declined to below 2000 rpm. The pilot applied carburetor heat, but did not see a change in engine power. He then reported a \"system malfunction\" to Air Traffic Control and navigated the airplane towards NH16. While on approach to runway 01, the pilot noticed he was gradually losing engine rpm and decided to land the airplane in a small field. During the landing attempt the airplane impacted the ground damaging the right wing and buckling the firewall before coming to rest. According to the responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the airplane came to rest a half mile southeast of the approach end of runway 01 in a small field adjacent to a road. The airplane was oriented on a heading of about 075 degrees magnetic.From photographs, an outboard section of the right wing leading edge was impact damaged with traces of dirt, consistent with impacting the ground. The nose landing gear was found in the dirt about 25 feet from the main wreckage between two parallel landing gear marks. The propeller had one blade bent forward slightly, while the opposite blade was bent slightly aft. The wreckage was retained for further examination at a later date.",

Over the past few weeks I had had several conversations regarding the maintenance necessary since a cylinder (#2) had to be replaced.  The mechanic ... had reported oil leaks and difficulty resolving them.  I was told the aircraft had been signed-off and released to fly that morning (8/15).  And that it had been adequately tested.  ...  Run-up was normal and temps (cylinder & head) were okay.  ... Take-off was normal and the plane was making full power.  I climbed to pattern attitude while turning left downwind.  When I reduced power about mid-field, the engine ran fine at first but then began missing.  I checked the mixture setting and confirmed full rich.  I then applied more power and the engine responded but quickly sputtered.  I noticed cylinder temps were high and switched fuel tanks.  During this process, I alerted the tower I was having an engine problem and he cleared me for a landing on Runway 12.  I had already initiated a turn to the field and lowered the gear.  The engine was turning, but not making power.  Continuing emergency procedures, I held the aircraft level and made best gliding speed.  Gear was down but flaps were not extended.

Subsequently, the airplane spun uncontrolled to the ground.  The right wing was located approximately 1/2 mile north of the main wreckage.  Examination of the separated wing revealed extensive fatigue cracking in both forward and aft wing spars.  On July 9,1999, AD 99-12-02 was issued by the FAA mandating flight and operating limitations on all Beech A45 (T-34) aircraft until structural inspection procedures could be developed.  The AD prohibited operations in acrobatic and utility categories, limited the flight load from to 2.5 \"G's\" and limited the maximum airspeed to 175 mph.  Entries in maintenance logbooks indicated that AD 99-12-02 was accomplished on June 3,1999.  A former customer of the operator had flown in the accident airplane in May, 2001, and recalled that during the flight, the instructor pilot told him that they pulled about positive 6 \"G's.\"  On August 16, 2001, the FAA issued AD 2001-13-18, which superseded AD 99-12-02, and required inspections of the wing spars for cracks per Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) mandatory Service Bulletin (SB) 57-3329.  AD 2001-13-18 allowed the operator an alternative method of compliance (AMOC) or an adjustment to the compliance time if the method provides an \"equivalent level of safety\" to the AD.  On November 13, 2001, the airplane underwent a 100-hour inspection at which time log entries indicated that paragraphs d(1), d(2), and d(3) of AD 2001-13-18 were complied  with and that paragraphs d(5), d(6), and d(7) were complied with by August 2002.  On August 26, 2002, at an aircraft total time of 8,031.4 hours, compliance with the remaining provisions of AD 2001-13-18, through the use of an AMOC, began with inspections of the rear spar bathtub fittings per the T-34 Technical Committee Report.  No discrepancies were noted at this time.  On December 16, 2002, the FAA issued a revised Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) number CE-02-38R2 to advise all operators to the available AMOCs for compliance with AD 2001-13-18.  The aircraft then underwent two subsequent 100-hour inspections and an annual inspection with no work noted related to the AMOC.  On November 5, 2003, the aircraft underwent a 100-hour inspection and entries in the logbook indicated that the mechanic called the FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) in Wichita, Kansas, and inquired about a possible time extension to comply with AD and AMOC requirements.  According to the logbook entry, the representative from the ACO informed the mechanic that \"as long as the rear spar inspection was complied with that the aircraft could continue to fly but the limiations specified in AD 99-12-02 would remain until AMOC completed.\"   In a written statement, the representative from the ACO stated that he received a telephone call concerning the T-34 wing AD and SAIB, regarding certain AMOC's.  He reported that the operator informed him \"that the aircraft was coming up on the two hundred hour limit specified in the SAIB and that the aircraft would be grounded because the replacement spar was not yet installed.  The operator wanted to know what could be done to continue flying.\"  The ACO representative further stated that he informed the operator to \"perform the inspections required by the AD.  This would permit the aircraft to continue flying until the mod could be completed.\"  On November 5, 2003, the rear bathtub fitting inspection was again performed with no discrepancies noted, 220.5 hours since the first bathtub fitting inspection.  No documentation of a scheduled AMOC modification was found in the aircraft logbook.  According to available records, the aircraft had not completed any AMOC or the Raytheon Service Bulletin.  The lower wing bathtub fitting had been inspected allowing operation beyond the 80-hour limit with restrictions, about 2 weeks prior to the accident.  On March 15, 2004, the FAA published AD2001-13-18 R1, which rescinded all previously approved AMOC's for the T-34 wing.  The new AD also grounded any T-34 that had not accomplished the Raytheon Service Bulletin, and had flown more than 80 hours since August 16, 2001.  The FAA determined that the AMOC's listed in AD 2001-13-18 did not address all critical areas in the wing spar assembly, and should no longer be valid.  ",
            "probable_cause": "The non-compliance with applicable Airworthiness Directives which required wing spar inspections, and the continued operation of the aircraft beyond the compliance time extension granted as per the approved alternate means of compliance (AMOC).  Also causal was the operation of the aircraft outside of its flight \"G\" load limitations.  Contributing factors were the misunderstanding between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ACO and maintenance personnel in regard to AD/AMOC compliance, the insufficient AMOC\u2019s, and failure of the operator to adequately comply with CFR Part 91 subpart E, maintenance."

The distance on the route from the company base airport to the accident site, was about 243 nautical miles.  The pilot said he landed at his last intermediate stop with the fuel selector on the right main tank, and departed with the fuel selector on the left main fuel tank.  Both the left and right wing tip fuel tanks were full of fuel.  While descending toward the company base, the engine quit.  The pilot selected the right wing tip tank, turned on the fuel boost pump, and attempted to restart the engine without success.  He selected the left wing tip tank, but the engine did not start.  The pilot made an emergency landing in a small opening in the trees about 15 miles south of the company base airport. During the landing, the airplane collided with several small trees, and then touched down in soft, boggy terrain.  The director of operations for the company responded to the accident scene.  He reported the left main fuel tank was empty.  Fuel was present in the right main tank, and in each wing tip tank.  For flight planning purposes, the director of operations said the company uses a fuel burn of 20 gallons per hour, and an airspeed of 125 knots.  An FAA inspector inspected  the airplane.  The inspector reported the left main tank was empty.  Fuel flowed from each fuel tank to the engine, except from the left main tank.  After replacing the propeller, the engine was started, and it ran normally. The airplane owner's handbook notes that the fuel selector should be changed to another tank before fuel is exhausted from the tank in use.

About 4 minutes later, the flight was cleared for takeoff. A witness observed the airplane as it taxied, and found it strange that the airplane did not stop and \"rev up\" its engines before takeoff. Instead, the airplane taxied onto the runway and proceeded with the takeoff without stopping. The airplane took off quickly, within 100 yards of beginning the takeoff roll, became airborne, and entered a steep left bank. The bank steepened, and the airplane descended and impacted the ground. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that the pilot's four-point restraint was not fastened and that at least a portion of the cockpit flight control lock remained installed on the control column. One of the pretakeoff checklist items was, \"Flight controls - Unlocked - Full travel.\" The airplane was not equipped with a control lock design, which, according to the airframe manufacturer's previously issued service bulletins, would \"minimize the possibility of the aircraft becoming airborne when take off is attempted with flight control locks inadvertently installed.\" In 1990, Transport Canada issued an airworthiness directive to ensure mandatory compliance with the service bulletins; however, the Federal Aviation Administration did not follow with a similar airworthiness directive until after the accident.",

Witnesses then observed the helicopter\u2019s tailboom separate from the fuselage and descend through the trees. The fuselage impacted the ground inverted, and the tailboom came to rest about 140 ft away. A mechanic reported that the pilot had indicated before the flight that the helicopter felt like it \u201cshuffled\u201d during translational lift; however, the mechanic suspected that the transmission mounts were starting to wear and would need to be changed at a later date.

The tailboom had separated from the aft fuselage at the tailboom attachment points. The lower two tailboom attachment fittings exhibited features consistent with overstress failure and did not show indications of fatigue and/or other failure modes. The upper two tailboom attachment fittings both contained fatigue cracks throughout almost the entire fracture surface.

At the time of departure, the latest weather report was 2 1/2 hours old. The most direct route to the medevac pickup site was over mountainous terrain. The CVR and wreckage evidence indicate that the flightcrew had abandoned its attempt to get to the pickup site and had turned south in the direction of base, when the helicopter impacted near the top of a mountain ridge. The helicopter, a Mil Mi-8MTV-1 (Mi-8) was properly certificated and maintained in accordance with applicable regulations. No evidence of pre-impact fire was found, nor was any indication of systems, mechanical, or structural failure. Radio-navigation capability was needed with at least one ground station in Haiti, to attempt the emergency mission in the ambient conditions into which the helicopter was flown. However, aircraft-to-station compatibility did not exist. The Mi-8 was equipped with non-directional beacon (NDB) navigation receivers that were not compatible with the VOR instrument landing system at MTPP. Cap Haitien Airport, near the intended medevac pickup site, maintained an NDB radio beacon, but was closed at the time of the accident. No flight plan was filed for the accident flight. FLIGHTCREW PERFORMANCE:  The flightcrew was properly certificated and qualified in accordance with applicable regulations of the Russian Federation, and had there passed instrument flight checks. However, the flightcrew did not maintain instrument currency in Haiti. No International Charter Inc. of Oregon (ICI)/Vladivostok Air (V/A) flightcrew had flown a practice or actual instrument approach in Haiti, and the operator had no relationship with any radio-navigation facility in Haiti. Consequently, the flightcrew's navigation and approach-to-landing options in accordance with instrument flight rules (IFR) were non-existent. Also limited were final escape options. When, as indicated on the CVR, the flightcrew was attempting to visually navigate in the mountains in near total darkness and fog, there was no mention of climbing into the clouds to a level above the highest terrain and navigating to an instrument approach to a landing. When interviewed following the accident, the pilots in the first flightcrew on the emergency medevac mission mentioned the possibility of climbing into overcast conditions if they encountered conditions similar to those involved in the accident; when asked how they would descend from actual meteorological conditions (IMC), they mentioned the global positioning system (GPS). That option is tenuous, however, in a mountainous country that is part of the large island of Hispaniola. According to the CVR, the accident flightcrew made no mention of GPS.     THE OPERATOR:  The operator (ICI) is a U.S. company. Although possessing a commercial air taxi certificate in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135, it had limited aircraft assets, and did not own, fly, or maintain helicopters. It contracted with V/A, a Russian Federation-based owner/operator, for the helicopters, as well as piloting, training, and maintenance duties. The operator's Russian flightcrews were well-qualified in accordance with Russian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations, however, they were at a linguistic disadvantage in contracting with an operator whose primary language is English and flying in a country whose national language is French. The fact that no radio-navigation compatibility was established between the Russian flightcrews and the Haitian or United Nations authorities in Haiti demonstrates that the contract with V/A was not adequately supported by the U.S. operator or the Haitian CAA. Either entity could have assisted the Russian flightcrews by establishing a safe IMC-compatible radio-navigation relationship, including filing IFR flight plans and facilitating the scheduling and flying of practice instrument approaches in Haiti.    AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, PORT-AU-PRINCE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT:  The meteorologist at MTPP did not give reports after 1700, on the day of the accident, and, according to the CAA, departed the tower following the 1700 weather report. A timely meteorological observation would have assisted the accident emergency medevac flightcrew in planning and decision-making.CAA HAITI AND UNTIED NATIONS MISSION:  The Civil Aviation Administration, Haiti, governed the flight rules and oversaw the operations facilities and navigation aids in Haiti. The United Nations Mission in Haiti provided operational tasking to these flights. There was, however, no evidence that an authority came forward and volunteered to assist the Russian flightcrews regarding language, communications and navigation difficulties in the sometimes difficult transportation, logistic, and in this case, emergency medevac-tasked mission.FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION:  About the time of the accident, passengers departing Miami International Airport (MIA), Florida for MTPP were handed written cautions that the destination airport was not fully certified. There was no evidence found that the FAA had come to Haiti and assisted in upgrading communications and radio navigation facilities at the international airport or at regional airports. Upgraded communications and navigational support may have proved useful to both flightcrews on the day and later night of the attempted lifesaving mission.",
            "probable_cause": "The flightcrew's inability to maintain visual contact with mountainous terrain in night, instrument meteorological conditions.  Contributing to the accident was a lack of preparation and support for difficult flight conditions, including lack of coordination between the U.S. operator, its Russian flightcrew and aircraft-owner partner, United Nations tasking authorities, and the Haitian civil aviation authority.

The airplane rotated inverted and embedded itself into the front of a residential house. Postaccident examination and testing of the left magneto revealed that the magneto\u2019s distributor block bushing was worn to an extent that it provided significant radial play between the bushing and distributor block. The bushing, which holds the distributor gear axle in place, would permit the distributor gear to intermittently disengage from the drive gear. Once the distributor gear had disengaged from the drive gear, the internal timing of the magneto would be off, which could disrupt the normal ignition sequence and operation of the engine. If the pilot had switched to the right magneto, engine power would have likely been restored. The most recent magneto overhaul was performed in 1989.

A witness, who saw the airplane when it was about 3 miles from the airport, described it as being high for a landing on the runway. He then said the airplane began a \u201cgradual\u201d descent, followed by a \u201crapid\u201d nose-down descent before it went out of sight. Another witness stated that she saw the airplane suddenly go straight down. One of the passengers stated that, shortly before the accident, the wings were rocking and it felt like the airplane was \u201ctossed around\u201d by the wind. A postimpact fire ensued. An examination of the wreckage indicated that the airplane struck the ground in a 35-degree left bank and about a 52- to 57-degree nose down descent angle; the engines were operating at the time of impact. A postaccident examination of the airplane did not reveal any anomalies indicative of any systems problems prior to the accident. Given the statements of the witnesses, it is likely that the pilot, when he realized the airplane was high on approach, reduced the airplane\u2019s airspeed and raised the nose in order to more rapidly decrease its altitude. The airplane then likely entered an aerodynamic stall, which would have caused the motion felt by the passenger as the airplane rapidly descended nose-down and began rotating before impacting the ground. While the pilot was experienced in flying multi-engine airplanes, he only had 3.1 hours of flying experience in the accident airplane with a flight instructor and only 5 hours total time in the make and model. Although the investigation was unable to determine what role the pilot\u2019s experience played in the accident, it is likely that his limited experience in the airplane contributed to his lack of airspeed maintenance.The NTSB has long been concerned about the use of proper restraints in general aviation airplanes. In this accident, an adult and an 11-year-old child were belted in the front passenger seat together. Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 91.107(a)(3) states that each person \u201cmust occupy an approved seat or berth with a safety belt and, if installed, shoulder harness, properly secured about him or her during movement on the surface, takeoff, and landing.\u201d However, the regulation does not specify that all passengers occupy separate seats. On August 11, 2010, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-10-121 asking the FAA to \u201camend 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 to require separate seats and restraints for every occupant.\u201d The Safety Recommendation is classified \u201cOpen\u2014Unacceptable Response,\u201d since the FAA\u2019s proposed clarification of the rule does not discourage or prohibit the unsafe practice of allowing multiple occupants to share a seat and/or restraint system and does not provide clear guidance to general aviation pilots regarding seat belt and seating requirements.",

The driver  (fleet service agent) of the belt loader was fatally injured during the accident sequence, while the aircraft and belt loader received minor damage.  The initial examination of the belt loader revealed no external damage other than damage to the steering wheel, steering column, and the operator's seat.  The upper portion of the steering wheel had struck the underside of the airplane during the impact sequence, and was bent into an oval shape to the rear and in a downward direction.  There was no evidence of breaks or kinks in the hydraulic lines leading to the steering actuator.   The single eyewitness to the accident stated that he saw the fleet service agent approach the aircraft from the right rear, turn to the right around a fuel cart located off the right wing, and try to stop the belt loader.  He speculated that her foot may have slipped off the brake pedal at that time.  An accelerator pedal and a brake pedal are located in the footwell of the belt loader.  Both are metal, and the 2 \u00be by 4-inch brake pedal has raised holes in it to improve foot traction.  The right edge of the pedal also has a 5/8-inch raised lip.  The accelerator pedal is curved, and is 3 \u00bd inches by 2 inches.  The pedals are 4 inches apart laterally.  The vehicle's brake system was examined using a skid test.  The NMC-Wollard TC-888 belt loader is a four-wheeled, gasoline powered, single-seat vehicle equipped with an open driver's compartment and a 297.5-inch continuous moving belt assembly.  The belt assembly can pivot, via hydraulics, at its rear end to facilitate different aircraft baggage door sill heights.  When the belt assembly is lowered completely, the vehicle is 47.5 inches high, measured from the top of the steering wheel to the ground.  The weight of the vehicle is 5,900 pounds.   All four wheel assemblies achieved a locked condition when the brakes were fully applied.  Also, the vehicle's maximum sustained speed of 18 miles per hour (mph) was measured utilizing a police speed-detecting laser.  An examination of the vehicle's engine and drive components revealed no damage or defects.  The throttle return springs were firm and provided good return.  The accelerator foot pedal was not damaged, and was able to move without any restrictions or objects impeding its movement.

On short final for a touch-and-go landing the flaps were selected to 40 degrees, the full down position.  Touchdown was within 300 feet of the runway threshold.  During the landing rollout the instructor directed the student to set the flaps to 20 degrees, which the instructor double checked by looking at the flap selector lever. Power was added and the airplane rotated about 600 to 700 feet down the runway.  After 5 seconds in the air the rear-seated passenger announced that the flaps were still full down.

Several witnesses reported hearing the airplane during climb out.  Each witness described smooth engine noise, brief 'sputtering,' and then a total loss of engine power.  The airplane descended straight ahead at the same pitch attitude, then the nose dropped, a parachutist exited, and the airplane entered a spiraling descent.  Two more jumpers exited the airplane before ground contact.  A review of jump logs and conversation with the operator revealed the pilot flew three lifts of jumpers to approximately 10,000 feet.  Each lift was approximately 30 minutes in duration.  The accident flight occurred during the fourth lift.  The airplane departed on its first lift with 30 gallons of fuel.  No fuel was dispensed into the airplane between the first and fourth lift.  At the scene, 8 ounces of fuel were drained from the selected tank, and a leak test revealed no leaks.  Examination revealed that all fuel system components were operational and there were no pre-impact anomalies. A request for a jump club SOP revealed that no such document existed.  The club operator reported that club operations were at his direction. ",

After takeoff a discrepancy with the landing gear warning system occurred evidenced by activation of the gear warning horn and gear unsafe annunciation while the landing gear was retracted.  The flight continued and climbed to 8,000 feet for planned stall warning tests.  Following the tests it was learned that the gear warning indication would not cease to operate with the landing gear retracted unless the throttles were reduced to approximately 14 inches manifold pressure.  The flight returned to the departure airport while the landing gear warning horn sounded and the unsafe gear annunciator was illuminated.  While on the base leg he lowered the landing gear selector handle and confirmed 3 green gear down and locked lights were illuminated.  He turned onto 2 mile final where he confirmed two times the landing gear was down and locked as indicated by the 3 down and locked lights.  He touched down first on the main landing gears followed by the nose landing gear.  When he reduced back pressure, \"the aircraft suddenly pitched nose down like the nose gear had collapsed.\"  He believed the main gear had collapsed based on the fact that the airplane was sliding on the runway in a level attitude.  After the airplane came to rest, he confirmed with the passenger that the landing gear selector handle was in the \"down\" position and only the left main down and locked light was illuminated.  He secured the airplane and after he and the passenger exited it, fuel leakage was noted from the right fuel tank.  The pilot-rated occupant seated in the right front seat confirmed the statement from the pilot that the landing gear was extended while on the base leg and 3 down and locked lights were illuminated following gear extension.  The down and locked indication was confirmed 2 more times during the approach.  The airplane was landed smooth on the main landing gear followed by the nose landing gear.  The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane began traveling to the right.  He believed the right main landing gear had collapsed, and the airplane slid to the right side of the runway during which the right wing collided with a taxiway sign.  The airplane spun approximately 150 degrees to the right and came to rest upright on grass.  Before the pilot secured the airplane, he also noted only the left main landing gear down and locked light was illuminated and the landing gear selector handle was in the down position.  Following recovery of the airplane, an FAA inspector examined the airplane 4 days after the accident.  Upon application of electrical power using an external power cart, and with the landing gear selector handle in the down position, the aural gear warning horn was sounding and no down and locked light was noted for the left main landing gear.  The horn and light were attributed to the main landing gear actuator attach point being sheared.  The left main landing gear down microswitch was bypassed and the left landing gear down and locked light illuminated and the aural gear warning tone stopped.  An attempt was then made to raise the landing gear but no movement or sound was noted from the normal landing gear hydraulic pump.  The pump was then supplied power directly and the landing gear retracted.  No determination was made as to the reason why the landing gear did not retract with electrical power applied to the airplane.  The nose and right main landing gears were then extended with electrical power applied directly to the hydraulic pump; attempts to forcefully unlock them were unsuccessful.  The only discrepancy noted was the nose landing gear over-center locking device seemed to have \"some play.\"  Examination of a new production airplane revealed no evidence of play as compared to the accident airplane.  At the time of the accident the airplane had accumulated approximately 827 hours and 372 flights.  The airplane was used for flight testing and in the previous several months, was operated on at least 6 flights on grass airstrips, grooved and un-grooved asphalt runways.  No excessive strains were noted to the instrumented landing gear during operation on the asphalt and grass runways during the previous flights.  According to personnel from The New Piper Aircraft, Inc., post accident rigging check of the landing gear revealed no abnormalities.  Documents provided by The New Piper Aircraft, Inc., personnel indicate that the nose gear and torque links were removed and inspected for wear limits on September 18, 2002, then reinstalled with a gear swing check on September 25, 2002.  The airplane had accumulated 2 hours 54 minutes and 2 cycles since then at the start of the accident flight.",
