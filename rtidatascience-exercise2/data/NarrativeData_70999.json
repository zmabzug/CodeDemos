The student selected an airport just below them to do a forced landing.

A witness saw the airplane touchdown at high speed with only a quarter of the runway remaining and observed the airplane engulfed with a heavy mist of water spray as it left the pavement into the grassy end of the runway. The witness then observed the airport weather station to show winds from 240 degrees at 8 knots. The pilot had stated that the airplane was operating normally before the accident.",

The surface on which the pilot began his takeoff roll is bounded with blue taxiway markers and was estimated to be 2,100 feet from the point the takeoff began to the berm on the runway.  According to Cessna, a new Cessna 310 under similar conditions and loading, taking off on a level, dry hard surface runway, would require 1,738 feet to become airborne, and 2,061 feet to clear a 50-foot obstacle.  The accident airplane was built in 1964 and no allowances were made for the dirt surface on which the takeoff was attempted.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's attempt to depart on a taxiway unsuitable for takeoff under existing conditions.  An additional factor was a berm at the end of the taxiway."

The airplane weathervaned into the wind, at which time he applied full left rudder to compensate.  The pilot  tried to maintain control of the airplane as it skipped off the right side of the runway onto the grass.  Subsequently, the left main gear collapsed due to the side load and the airplane came to an immediate stop.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the nose gear had collapsed, the left main gear had separated from the airframe; the right main landing gear remained attached to the airframe, but the upper and lower torque links had separated, and the wheel was rotated to the right.  Further examination of the upper and lower link assemblies securing bolt, bushing, two AN washers, castellated nut, and cotter pin, revealed it had pulled through the lower torque link boss, which allowed the main wheel, brake, and strut assembly to rotate inside the strut housing.  In addition, both propellers were damaged and the left wing sustained substantial damage. The airplane was last inspected on March 13, 2008, at which time, the main gear camber and toe was adjusted.  The failure occurred approximately 39.1 hours after this last inspection.  On November 23, 1983, Cessna issued Service Kit SK 421-118, which called for the replacement of washers and for inspection of the main gear torque links. The Service Kit specified washer P/N 504518-2 to be installed under the bolt head and nut, with replacement washer P/N S1450-5H12-063 to be incorporated into the next revision to the Service Kit.  Cessna issued a Service Information Letter in conjunction with the Service Kit  for the purpose of \"improved service life and main gear alignment retention.\"  The washers listed in the Service Kit were not installed on the accident airplane.  Compliance with the Service Kit and Service Information Letter is not mandatory.  ",

The pilot, who was the registered owner, was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The private pilot and three passengers sustained fatal injuries; the airplane sustained substantial damage. The personal cross-country flight was originating from Upper Loon Creek with a planned destination of Driggs-Reed Memorial Airport, Driggs, Idaho. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed.The pilot had a solar energy system installed on his residence in the Driggs area and wanted the same solar company, Creative Energies, to assess if it was possible to do a similar installation at his private residence at Diamond D Ranch, where he was a partial owner. The pilot had been staying in Driggs for several days and had planned to take a few of the Creative Energies employees to the ranch to perform an evaluation of the solar installation possibilities. Earlier in the week, he notified the ranch manager that he intended on flying into Upper Loon Creek, located about two miles downstream from the ranch on a northeasterly heading. During the winter, the ranch is only practically accessible by flying into the airport.The pilot and three passengers departed from Driggs with the airplane loaded with full fuel in the wing tanks. After completing the approximate 170 nautical mile (nm) cross-country flight, the airplane landed at Upper Loon Creek. The solar employees performed their assessment and they all left the ranch about 1300 at which time the pilot told the ranch personnel that he wanted to depart before the wind picked up (the wind at the ranch was about 5 mph). There were no witnesses to the accident, nor did anyone at the ranch hear the airplane depart.The accident site was located partially submerged in the shallow creek; the fuselage along with a majority of the wing skin was consumed by fire. Situated on the relatively level terrain, the airplane came to rest inverted and the debris path was oriented on a 080-degree magnetic heading. The main wreckage, which consisted of a majority of the airframe and engine, was located about 600 feet from the fence located at the end of runway 040 on a heading of 060 degrees. The runway and first identified impact marks were located on a raised plateau about 40 feet higher than the river.The first identified impact point consisted of broken tree limbs located about 170 feet northeast from the center of the fence and about 430 feet south west of the main wreckage. The first tree impacted was identified by it having a junction where two separate branches forked upward, both of which had fresh cuts around the 50 foot level. The tree was located in line with the far right side of the fence, which was about 100 feet east of an extended runway centerline. There were numerous broken branches along the debris field to the main wreckage. The nose wheel was located about 100 feet from the first tree and remained on the plateau. The outboard half of the left horizontal stabilizer was found in the river around the same length down the debris field as the nose landing gear. The leading edge was deformed aft about 1 foot creating an accordion appearance, with the aluminum skin folded over on itself. This u-shaped divot was about 10 inches in diameter and similar in shape and size to that of a landing gear wheel.The wreckage was recovered for further examination.",

While on the landing roll, he was unable to stop the airplane before colliding with a hill at the end of the runway.  A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the airplane about an hour after the accident occurred.  He did not see any skid marks to indicate emergency braking action.  He also saw no signs of fuel at the accident site.  He visually checked the inside of the fuel tanks and found that both were empty.  Neither of the fuel tanks were breached during the accident.  He also noted that the airplane's fuel gauges were inoperable.  The pilot told him that the fuel indictors do not work, but he visually checked the quantity before flights.  He added that he uses automobile fuel, which has no color, and therefore, is difficult to verify quantity.",

He estimated that the approach brought the airplane 60 feet right of the runway centerline so he made a correction to align the airplane with the runway. When the airplane returned to level flight and was about 25 feet above the runway, the left wing stalled and the airplane landed hard on the left main landing gear, bending the rear spar of the left wing.

The pilot elected to fly over mountainous terrain in dark, nighttime conditions. Recorded radar data shows that after cruising for nearly 2 hours, the airplane initially entered a slow descent from 12,600 to 11,100 feet. Thereafter, the radar track shows the airplane commencing a clockwise turn while continuing to descend. While reversing course, the pilot became spatially disoriented, and the airplane rapidly descended, as evidenced by its sudden disappearance from radar. During the descent the airplane broke apart. Wreckage was found on a 6,400-foot (mean sea level) mountain and was scattered over a 950 by 350 foot oval-shaped area. The major components that separated were the horizontal stabilator, the vertical tail surfaces, and the 6-foot-long outboard span of both wings. The propeller blades exhibited signatures consistent with the absorption of rotational energy during ground impact. No preimpact anomalies were found during the wreckage examination and all fractures were overload in character. The descending flight profile, followed by the course reversal away from the pilot's destination, was consistent with a spiral maneuver.

About 28 minutes after takeoff, while flying about 3,000 feet mean sea level over a sparsely populated and heavily wooded area with few ground reference lights, the flight likely encountered light rain. The pilot flew south of a wind turbine, initiated an approximate 180-degree left turn with 300 feet altitude loss, then began following a dirt road associated with the wind turbines. After completion of the turn he advised the controller, \"...we're inadvertent IMC [instrument meteorological conditions], reversing...\" and asked for a heading to the nearest airport. The controller asked the pilot if he wanted a vector to the nearest airport and also if the flight was in IMC, but there was no reply. The controller provided a heading for a vector to a nearby airport but the pilot did not respond. The flight continued in the same orientation following the course reversal, flying past another wind turbine before turning right; the controller again advised the pilot of the direction to the nearest airport. The pilot immediately responded that he was, \"...having trouble maintaining control here.\" The controller informed the pilot that the nearest airport was heading 068 degrees and 8 miles away, and the recorded radar data indicates the pilot flew a north-northeasterly heading with changes in altitude noted. The comments from the pilot followed by the maneuvering (changes in altitude and heading) were consistent with the known effects of spatial disorientation. Radio and radar contact were lost; the helicopter descended on an east-northeasterly heading into trees and terrain in a heavily wooded area away from any nearby wind turbines. Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed extensive impact damage, although there was no evidence of a preimpact failure with the flight controls, drive line, or structure. The engine was found to operate normally and data downloaded from the engine monitoring unit indicates no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. While there was no record of an official preflight weather briefing before departure, a text message from the non-instrument rated pilot to his brother approximately 1 hour before departure stating, \"...Waiting out weather to fly back to [Ocean City, MD] tonight\" indicates that to some extent he was aware of the weather. Had the pilot obtained an official preflight weather briefing for the intended VFR flight, the briefing specialist likely would have advised him against VFR flight due to IMC (ceiling less than 1,000 feet and visibility less than 3 miles) and mountain obscuration that were forecast to exist in the accident area.Although the left seat occupant was a student pilot, it is unlikely the pilot-in-command was giving him instruction during the accident flight. While operation of a helicopter with decreased ceiling and visibility can be safely performed, the environmental conditions in the accident site area consisting of a sparsely populated heavily wooded area with few ground reference lights and no illumination from the moon were indicators that VFR flight should not have continued.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's decision to continue VFR flight into night instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in spatial disorientation and a loss of control."

The airplane was at 2,600 feet and in a shallow descent approximately 8 miles northwest of the airport when the pilot checked in with the tower and requested landing.  Three and a half minutes later, the pilot reported that he had lost an engine and was in a right-hand turn.  Radar data indicated that the airplane was 2 miles southwest of the airport at 1,200 feet msl.  The radar track continued to depict the airplane in a descent and in a right-hand turn, approximately 1.9 miles west of the approach end of the runway.  The altitude fluctuated between 400 and 600 feet, the track turned right again, and stabilized on an approximate 100-degree magnetic heading, which put the airplane on a left base for the runway.  The track entered a third right-hand turn at 500 feet.  The pilot's last transmission indicated that one engine was not producing power.  The last radar return was 6 seconds later at 200 feet, in the direct vicinity of where the wreckage was located.  Using the radar track data, the average ground speed calculations showed a steady decrease from 134 knots at the time of the pilot's initial report of a problem, to 76 knots immediately before the airplane impacted terrain.  The documented minimum controlable airspeed (Vmc) for this airplane is 68 knots.  The zero bank angle stall speed varied from 78 knots at a cruise configuration to 70 knots with the gear and flaps down.  A sound spectrum study using recorded air traffic control communications concluded that one engine was operating at 2,630 rpm, and one engine was operating at 1,320 rpm.  Propeller damage was consistent with the right engine operating at much higher power than the left engine at the time of impact, and both propellers were at or near the low pitch stops (not feathered).  Examination and teardown of both engines did not reveal any evidence of mechanical malfunction.  Investigators found that the landing gear was down and the flaps were fully deployed at impact.  In this configuration, performance calculations showed that level flight was not possible with one engine inoperative, and that once the airspeed had decreased below minimum controllable airspeed (Vmc), the airplane could stall, roll in the direction of the inoperative engine, and enter an uncontrolled descent.  The pilot had been trained and had demonstrated a satisfactory ability to operate the airplane in slow flight and single engine landings.  However, flight at minimum controllable airspeed with one engine inoperative was not practiced during training.  The operator's training manual stated that during single engine training an objective was to ensure the pilot reduced drag; however, there was no procedure to accomplish this objective, and the ground training syllabus did not specifically address engine out airplane configuration performance as a dedicated topic of instruction.  The operator's emergency procedures checklist and manufacturer's information manual clearly addressed the performance penalties of configuring the airplane with an inoperative engine, propeller unfeathered, the landing gear down, and/or the flaps deployed.  The engine failure during flight procedure checklist and the engine inoperative go-around checklist, if followed, configure the airplane for level single engine flight by feathering the propeller, raising the flaps, and retracting the landing gear.",
            "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot to execute the published emergency procedures pertaining to configuring the airplane for single engine flight, which would have allowed him to maintain minimum controllable airspeed (Vmc) and level flight.  The pilot's failure to maintain minimum controllable airspeed (Vmc) led to a stall and subsequent Vmc roll at a low altitude.  Contributing to the accident was the operator's inadequate pilot training in the single engine flight regime, and the loss of power from the left engine for undetermined reasons."

A fatigue crack had initiated at two corrosion pit sites in the bore, which had been painted over without the corrosion being dressed out during the overhaul.  Also, many additional corrosion pits were located circumferentially in line with the origin area.  The blade's bore was also contaminated with glass beads.  All of these conditions found during the examination were contrary to the procedural steps in the manufacturer's overhaul instructions, and established that the blade was reassembled with an incomplete and improper overhaul.  The FAA inspector assigned to oversee the overhaul company said he did not observe any repair station deficiencies during his surveillance inspections.  A Safety Board inspection following the accident disclosed that the repair station's personnel were not following prescribed manufacturer overhaul procedures, did not have the required chemicals for blade treatment, and did not possess required procedure manuals.  Additional inspections of other propellers overhauled by the company revealed that propellers overhauled as early as 1997, when the company commenced business, showed evidence of corrosion in the pilot bores, and were unairworthy.",
            "probable_cause": "The fracture and separation of a propeller blade during cruise flight due to fatigue and corrosion pits in the blade pilot bore, and an improper overhaul of the separated propeller by repair station personnel.  Factors contributing to the accident were the FAA's inadequate surveillance of the repair station, and the repair station's inadequate procedures."

The flight entailed flying over and near ocean waters and mountainous terrain during dusk and night conditions without lighted ground references (such as buildings and street lights) due to the uninhabited topography. With the pilot and patient were a paramedic and a nurse. While crossing over a portion of ocean approaching rising terrain, the helicopter likely encountered low ceilings and snow squalls. With the pilot unable to discern either the shore or the ocean, it is probable he flew the helicopter under control into the ocean. Pieces of the helicopter and the body of the nurse were recovered several days after the accident. The rest of the helicopter and its occupants are presumed to have sunk in the ocean. There were no distress calls received from the pilot, and no history of any significant mechanical issues with the helicopter. The accident flight was the pilot's first flight from this clinic, and this was his first winter season flying in Alaska. He had expressed his concern to a mechanic prior to the flight about flying over the accident route and water at night, and also told the nurse to bring his night vision goggles (NVGs) to assist him in seeing terrain. The pilot also had NVGs. It is unknown what weather information the pilot had when he elected to accept the flight. He had access to a company computer, and he and other company pilots routinely did their preflight weather planning using it. There is no record that he received any preflight weather briefing from the FAA, nor contacted them for weather information prior to his departure from the clinic, or sought weather updates while en route. It was night VFR when the pilot departed the clinic, but the weather had deteriorated near the accident site in close proximity to his departure time. The nearest reporting station was about 5 miles from the accident site. About 23 minutes before the accident, it was reporting instrument meteorological conditions with snow and low ceilings. Aerial search efforts had to be delayed due to the poor weather. Neither the operator nor the hospital provided en route weather updates, or primary dispatch services. The hospital's procedure was to call the assigned EMS pilot to request a flight, and the pilot made the decision to either accept or reject the flight. Company procedures required that the pilot complete a risk assessment form prior to taking a flight. There was no risk assessment form found for the accident flight, and company management could not locate other risk assessment forms for previous EMS flights. An exemplar risk assessment form was completed by the NTSB investigator-in-charge using information that the pilot could reasonably expect to have known prior to accepting the flight. That information equated to a \"Moderate\" risk level, and required company management's concurrence to authorize the flight. Company management was not notified. The pilot was required to phone the hospital communications center at 10-minute intervals via satellite phone while en route, and when he did not call at the required time, a search was initiated. The operator's main base was in Anchorage, and the EMS facility was in another Alaska town. The operator had not been assigned a principal operations inspector (POI) to oversee their operations until about 2 months prior to the accident. The POI had not inspected or visited the remote EMS location. Prior to the POI's assignment, the operator did not have a POI assigned for the preceding 22 months, but instead relied on various points of contact (POC) within the local FAA Flight Standards District Office to provide oversight. Investigation disclosed no evidence that any POC had visited the EMS facility. The operator also did not adhere to the proper procedures in training the accident pilot in the use of the NVGs. These discrepancies were not discovered by the FAA until after the accident. NTSB/SIR-06/01 recommended that the FAA require EMS operators to use formalized dispatch and flight-following procedures that include up-to-date weather information and assistance in flight risk assessment decisions. With a formalized dispatch and flight following process, it is probable the helicopter would have been turned around/canceled prior to entering instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), or due to the noncritical nature of the patient, the patient could have waited until an airplane was available that was capable of flying in IMC.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's decision to continue VFR flight into night instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were the operator's failure to adhere to an FAA-approved and mandated safety risk management program, the FAA's failure to provide sufficient oversight of the operator to ensure they were in compliance with the risk management program, the pilot's lack of experience in night winter operations in Alaska, and the operator's lack of an EMS dispatch and flight following system."

The five passengers and two pilots were not injured. The aircraft was registered to GOAT Airways LLC and operated by Executive Air Charter of Boca Raton, Inc., dba Fair Wind Air Charter, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as an executive/corporate flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was operated on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight was originating at the time of the incident. The intended destination was the Bob Hope Airport (BUR), Burbank, California.The incident occurred during the second flight of the day. The previous flight departed the McCarran International Airport (LAS), Las Vegas, Nevada, and arrived at EGE about 2040. The incident flight crew also operated the LAS to EGE flight, and no anomalies were reported with respect to that flight.The pilot reported that before taxing the airplane a flight control check was performed. He noted that the flight controls felt \"normal,\" with \"no binding or resistance issues.\" He added that the flight control forces seemed \"normally loaded.\" During the initial takeoff attempt, the pilot engaged the auto-throttles. He stated that about 75 knots, a triple chime sounded and a master warning illuminated. He immediately rejected the takeoff with \"light\" brake pressure, coasting to the end of the runway. The pilots reported that they did not observe any message on the Crew Alert System (CAS), nor were there any exceedance events recorded. In addition, the flight crew did not observe any tripped circuit breakers.Based on this information, the pilot elected to attempt another takeoff. During this takeoff, he did not use the auto-throttles, electing to set the engine power manually. He reported that as the airplane accelerated through approximately 75 knots, the triple chime/master warning activated again. He observed that the engine low pressure (LP) turbine speed indicated within the yellow arc. He subsequently reduced engine power slightly in order to return the LP turbine speed to the white arc (normal operating range). The pilot continued the takeoff. At rotation speed, he pulled back on the control yoke but the flight controls did not seem to respond normally. He added that the controls had no \"noticeable pressure resistance and felt unloaded with hydraulic pressure.\" He noted that the yoke was moved \"forward and then back further aft\" with the same result. The pilot subsequently rejected the takeoff, applying maximum braking and full reverse thrust. A right brake fire ensued. The flight crew and passengers evacuated without injury.The incident airplane was a 1987 Gulfstream Aerospace G-IV, serial number 1036. It was powered by two Rolls-Royce Tay 611-8 turbo-fan engines, each capable of producing 13,850 lbs of thrust. According to the operator, the airplane had accumulated 12,472 hours at the time of the incident. The airplane was maintained under an approved continuous aircraft maintenance program. The most recent inspection and maintenance activity was completed on February 7th, prior to departure from LAS. The maintenance work included the replacement of an inertial reference unit and the flight guidance computers.The investigation is on-going at this time. However, a postincident examination has not revealed any anomalies with respect to the flight control system. The cockpit voice recorder has been shipped to the NTSB recorders lab for download and analysis. The incident airplane was not equipped, nor was it required to be equipped, with a flight data recorder. Review of any additional non-volatile memory on-board the airplane is pending. At the present time, there is no indication that the circumstances of this incident are related to any previous G-IV takeoff accidents or incidents.",

During the landing roll, the left main gear leg failed. Post-accident inspection revealed that the attachment bolt from the gear leg broke in two pieces.  During the metallurgical examination, the specialist found that three major fracture zones were present.  Two of the zones were fairly flat and propagated on a plane that was perpendicular to the bolt axis, typical of fatigue progression.  One of the zones was covered with heavy accumulation of oxides and corrosion deposits.  The other zone was free of oxidation and deposits.  The third zone displayed a fracture propagation on a 45 degree slant.  This zone was typical of a final overstress separation.  The fatigue zones occupied about 75 percent of the bolt cross section at the fracture location.  The specialist reported that the presence of oxide and corrosion deposits suggested an 'old crack.' There was no evidence found of thread stripping.  Maintenance records indicate that since the time of manufacture in 1978, the aircraft had accumulated a total time of 77 hours.  During this time, there were several years in which the aircraft had not been operated. ",

He turned and proceeded toward an airport then he started hearing metallic grinding sounds as the engine power continued to decrease. Unable to maintain altitude, he elected to land downwind on a runway; he noted that his airspeed was about 100 knots at the threshold. The main landing gear contacted the surface about midpoint of the runway, and the pilot pushed the control yoke to force the nose landing gear onto the runway in an intentional effort to stop the airplane before running off a steep embankment. The airplane came to rest upright about three-quarters of the way down the length of the runway, with structural damage to the engine firewall. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed the head of the No. 3 cylinder had separated from the barrel due to an undetected fatigue crack that emanated from corrosion pits on the outer surface of the barrel. Paint covering crater-shaped corrosion blisters on the barrel indicates that the paint was applied to a surface that had already corroded and suggests that the corrosion developed over an extended period of time. Although the engine had only accrued about 9 hours since the last 100-hour inspection, the location of the piston at top dead center during the compression test would have been above the location of the fracture and the loss of compression likely would not have been detected.The engine manufacturer recommended that the engine be overhauled every 1500 hours or every 12 years. Although components of the cylinders were replaced in 1986, there was no record that the No. 3 cylinder had been replaced since the airplane was manufactured in 1979. Notably, the engine had accumulated about 1356 hours since installation and had not reached the manufacturer's recommended hour limit for overhaul. However, the 12-year time limit had been significantly exceeded and an overhaul would have involved either installing new or overhauled cylinders. Operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, the owner was not required to adhere to the manufacturer's overhaul recommendations. However, following both the manufacturer's recommended time and hour limitations would have likely addressed the fatigue cracking prior to the accident.",

The private pilot was fatally injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed Aiken Municipal Airport (AIK), Aiken, South Carolina, at an unknown time, and was destined for Wendell H Ford Airport (CPF), Hazard, Kentucky. The personal flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The owner of the accident airplane stated that he had spoken with the accident pilot about the flight to CPF earlier in the day, and that they had discussed the weather conditions. According to Lockheed Martin Flight Service, there were no records of the pilot having obtained a weather briefing through a Flight Service Station or through the DUAT service. There were also no records of the pilot having contacted any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control facilities during the flight. Preliminary radar information obtained from the FAA showed a target approaching CPF from the south at an altitude of about 8,300 feet, beginning about 1830, displaying the standard visual flight rules (VFR) transponder code of 1200. The target passed west of CPF about 1844, and continued north before beginning a descending right turn toward the southwest about 1846. About 1849, the target began a series of turns about 1 mile east of CPF, with altitudes varying between 7,400 to 6,700 feet.  The last two radar returns were at 1853:38 and 1854:02, with altitudes of 6,800 feet and 0 feet, respectively. The last radar return was located about 550 feet southwest of the accident site. The accident site was located about 1 nautical mile east of CPF in heavily wooded, mountainous terrain. The initial impact point was identified as a tree, past which the wreckage path extended on a heading of about 084 degrees. Along the wreckage path, several angularly-cut tree branches were identified that exhibited paint transfer consistent with propeller contact. The main wreckage came to rest about 70 feet past the initial impact point, and was destroyed by impact. All major components of the airplane were accounted for at the scene. The engine was separated from the airframe and heavily impact-damaged. Both propeller blades exhibited significant s-bending, leading edge gouging, and chordwise scratching. The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration third class medical certificate was issued in July 2014. Review of the pilot's logbook indicated that he had accumulated about 220 total hours of flight experience. The pilot did not possess an instrument rating. The airplane was manufactured in 1979, and was equipped with a Lycoming O-320 series, 150 hp reciprocating engine. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on August 1, 2014, at a total aircraft time of 2,136.75 hours. The 1905 weather observation at CPF included wind from 330 degrees at 4 knots, 3 miles visibility, drizzle, broken clouds at 800 feet, broken clouds at 1,200 feet, overcast clouds at 2,000 feet, temperature 11 degrees C, dew point 11 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.08 inches of mercury.

The mixture control cable was found separated from the rod end which was still attached to the Bellcrank (Mixture) at the airbox assembly.  Damage to about 11 threads at the end of the mixture cable was noted.  Maintenance records were reportedly destroyed in the fire.  The IA who performed the last annual inspection stated to the FAA inspector that the aircraft owner adjusted the mixture cable rod-end to attain the correct cushion and he (IA) checked it but failed to check the jam nut at the rod end for security.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators used data provided by various sources and may not have traveled in support of this investigation to prepare this aircraft incident report.Both pilots indicated that they had set up the navigation systems and briefed to fly an ILS Category III instrument approach to an autoland to runway 36C. The captain stated that,\"sometime below 300 feet,\" he disconnected the autopilot and took manual control of the airplane, noting that the airplane was slightly right of the centerline of the runway with the nose pointed to the left and the airplane was drifting toward the left.  As the captain maneuvered to correct the airplane's track, the bank angle aural alert sounded three times, once as the airplane descended below about 300 feet AGL, again at an altitude of about 200 feet AGL, and the last time at about 30-32 feet AGL. During the landing, the right wing tip, right slat and a landing light were damaged.The operator's Flight Manual states, in part, that autolands may be conducted to CAT I / II / III designated runways provided that the procedure does not have a chart note or NOTAM which renders the localizer unusable inside the runways threshold. The 11-5A Jeppesen approach chart for the ILS 36C approach had a note listed on the chart face that stated: IDQG LOC 36C unusable for rollout guidance.Relevant sections of the operator's Operating Manual stated that all Category III approaches are to be flown by the autopilot and to an autoland.  In interviews with the MD80 Fleet Training Manager, the MD80 Fleet captain, and an MD80 APD (Aircrew Program Designee), each stated that the operator trains its MD80 crews to autoland all Category III approaches, rather than manually flying the airplane during the final descent to the runway. According to the operator's DC-9 Operating Manual, the following conditions would require a go around from a Category III Approach:1. Below 300 feet (RA), if satisfactory tracking performance was not maintained.2. Failure of required airplane or ground equipment prior to DH (Cat II) or prior to touchdown (Cat III).FAA Advisory Circular (AC)120-71A \"Standard Operating Procedures for Flight Deck Crewmembers\" Appendix 2, states in part:An approach is stabilized when all of the following criteria are maintained from 1000 feet height above touchdown (HAT), or 500 feet HAT in VMC, to landing in the touchdown zone:1. The airplane is on the correct track.2. After glide path intercept, or after the FAF, or after the derived fly-off point (per Jeppesen) the pilot flying requires no more than normal bracketing corrections to maintain the correct track and desired profile (3\u00b0 descent angle, nominal) to landing within the touchdown zone. A stabilized approach means the airplane must be:\t\u2022 At Approach Speed (VREF + additives).\t\u2022 On the proper flight path at the proper sink rate.\t\u2022 At stabilized (spooled up) thrust.These requirements must be maintained throughout the rest of the approach for it to be considered a stabilized approach.  If the stabilized approach requirements cannot be satisfied by the minimum stabilized approach heights or maintained throughout the rest of the approach, a go-around was required.  The FAA Advisory Circular appendix goes on to state in part that normal bracketing corrections relate to bank angle, rate of descent, and power management and recommends ranges for the various parameters, noting that operating limitations in the approved airplane flight manual must be observed, and may be more restrictive.  For bank angle the AC recommends a maximum bank angle permissible during approach is specified in the approved operating manual used by the pilot, and is generally not more than 30\u00b0; the maximum bank angle permissible during landing may be considerably less than 30\u00b0, as specified in that manual.According to the operator's Flight Manual Supplement,there were six modes of the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)function.  Mode 6 provided optional callouts for descent through predefined radio altitudes between 2,500 and 10 feet AGL and excessive roll or bank angle warning.  Bank angle warning provided over-banking protection during approach, climb out, and cruise.  Additionally, the warning protected against wing or engine strikes during the landing.   Further, the operator's DC-9 Operating Manual also stated in part that with the main landing gear compressed, the landing light will strike the runway at approximately eight and one-half degrees of bank, and that excessive bank angles should be avoided at low altitudes.The operator had a no-fault go-around policy. Pilots were told to execute every approach with the presumption that a missed approach was a successful outcome, and asked to plan each approach through the missed-approach procedure and make the decision to land only when all criteria are safely satisfied. According to the operator's Flight Manual, the captain \"should give every consideration to a recommendation by another cockpit crewmember that a missed approach be executed.\"  The American Airlines MD80 Fleet Captain told investigators that the first officer could also call for a go around, and did not have to explain why.During post-incident interviews, the first officer stated that during the approach, neither pilot mentioned a go around.  The captain stated in his interview that he did not consider a go around.",
            "probable_cause": "The Captain's failure to initiate a go-around from a Category III approach when satisfactory tracking performance was not maintained below the required altitude resulting in excessive bank angle maneuvers at low altitude. Factors contributing to the incident were:  The Captain's decision to execute a Category III autoland approach on a runway without rollout guidance contrary to company Flight Manual guidance, the Captain's decision to deviate from the Category III approach and continue it manually contrary to the company Operating Manual, and the First Officer's failure to call for a go-around when the approach became unstable."

The pilot acknowledged the landing clearance and declined further assistance. Review of recorded radar data revealed that after the airplane\u2019s departure, it remained within the airport traffic pattern and ascended to an altitude of about 528 feet above ground level near the downwind-to-base leg of the flight. In addition, a pilot-rated witness located adjacent to the accident site reported observing the airplane depart and remain within a left traffic pattern for the runway. The witness stated that the airplane appeared to be traveling slowly as it began to initiate a left turn from the base leg to final approach before stalling and entering a spin to the left.  Security camera images captured the accident airplane in a left-wing-low, nose-down attitude just before impact with the ground.  In addition, the left cabin door was observed in an open position before impact. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Witness reports and findings from the wreckage examination are consistent with a loss of control and subsequent aerodynamic stall and spin. It is likely that the pilot was distracted by the open door and failed to maintain sufficient airspeed while turning from the base leg to final approach and lost control of the airplane.Review of the pilot\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical records showed that the pilot did not report any mental disorders, depression, or anxiety.  However, the pilot\u2019s personal medical records revealed that he had been treated for depression for several years, including several episodes of acute exacerbation. Postaccident toxicology testing found venlafaxine and nortriptyline (both used in the treatment of depression) in the postmortem cavity blood that exceed the toxic ranges for peripheral blood set by the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute.

According to the first officer, while on final approach, the \"AUG/AIL\" (aileron augmentation) light illuminated, indicating a system malfunction.  He reset the system per the flight manual (FM), and the light went out.  The approach was continued, but during landing, he reported that the AUG/AIL lamp illuminated again, and that the right wing dropped, striking the ground.  The first officer said the captain, who was on the controls, had full left aileron deflection trying to compensate, without success.  The airplane landed on runway 2C (center) with a magnetic runway heading of 020 degrees.  The airport weather observation reported the wind as 310 degrees at 12 knots, with gusts to 17 knots.  The first officer reported the wind as 310 degrees at 12 knots, with gusts to 19 knots.

According to the FM, the maximum demonstrated crosswind component, when the wind is 90 degrees to the runway heading, is 24.7 knots.  The FAA approved Master Minimum Equipment List limits the airplane to 20 knots maximum crosswind component with the AUG/AIL system inoperative.  The AUG/AUL system is computer controlled, and automatically activates when the wing flaps are set below 25 degrees, using a combination of aileron and corresponding spoilers to enhance the airplane's roll rate at low airspeeds.  The airplane received structural damage to the right wing.  An examination of the aileron augmentation system revealed an anomaly in the computer that controls the AUG/AIL system.

The airplane was located 8 hours 26 minutes after the accident along a crash debris line that extended between 1.31 miles and 1.53 miles northwest of Arlington, Alabama. Airframe components recovered from the accident site were submitted to the NTSB Materials laboratory for examination. The examinations revealed all failures were consistent with overstress fracturing and there was no evidence of pre-existing conditions or fatigue damage. Examination of the airframe revealed that the airframe design limits were exceeded. The Pilot's Operating Handbook states the maximum structural cruising speed is 173 knots indicated airspeed or 170 knots calibrated airspeed. The co-pilot airspeed indicator at the crash site indicated 180 knots calibrated airspeed. The design maneuvering speed is 135 knots indicated airspeed or 133 knots calibrated airspeed. ",

The weight-shift-control aircraft was registered to a private party and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The private pilot sustained fatal injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence. The local flight departed Polson about 0658. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.According to the aircraft owner, the accident pilot owned a similar aircraft to the accident type, but equipped with floats. The accident pilot had requested that they remove the standard wing from the aircraft, so that he could use it on his. In return, he would temporarily install a smaller wing on the accident aircraft. The owner agreed, and both he and the pilot spent the prior evening attaching the smaller wing, completing the installation by 2300. The owner was concerned that the wing may not be the correct type for the aircraft, and was particularly anxious about center of gravity issues. The pilot stated that he would fly the aircraft on his own in the morning, cautiously takeoff, and fly low over the runway while ascertaining the handling characteristics. If it could be controlled safely, he would then continue the climb and perform practice maneuvers.The following morning, the owner observed the first flight with the smaller wing installed. He watched as the pilot held the nose off the ground for a long period during rotation, and then depart. The aircraft climbed uneventfully to about 600-800 feet above ground level, and then began to circle back towards midfield. It turned east in the direction of the adjacent fairground, and appeared to be setting up for a crosswind approach to join the right downwind leg for runway 18. The owner was confused by this maneuver, as he felt landing was premature.The aircraft then suddenly rolled into a steep banking turn. The turn continued through 360 degrees, progressing into a \"corkscrew\" descent. He did not hear the sound of the engine producing power during the descent, and initially thought the pilot was performing a corkscrew maneuver to descend and land. However, the aircraft did not roll out as the spin progressed, and as it developed he was expecting to see the ballistic recovery parachute deploy. After between 6 to 8 revolutions the aircraft descended out of his view. He surmised that there was plenty of time and altitude to fire the ballistic recovery parachute, and he was surprised that the pilot hadn't done so.Another witness, located in a recreational vehicle park adjoining the west side of the airport, observed an \"ultralight\" aircraft flying from the direction of the airport at an altitude that seemed appropriate based on his prior observations of departing aircraft. He initially thought it was his friend flying, and waved to him. He observed the pilot's arm moving, and assumed that he was waving back. The aircraft continued, and then initiated a steep and rapid banking turn, which quickly progressed into a spin. The aircraft continued spiraling until it descended and out of his view.The aircraft came to rest in the recreational vehicle park, at the foot of a series of utility lines. None of the lines were damaged, and the aircraft sustained crush damage to the entire cabin structure. The ballistic recovery parachute had not deployed.",

The pilot said that he made a 3-point landing after towing a glider aloft.  The airplane bounced slightly on touchdown and, on the second ground contact, the pilot heard a snap sound and the right main landing gear collapsed.  The airplane fell down on the right wing and spun around in the dirt.  An FAA airworthiness inspector examined the airplane and the runway. The inspector observed the two touchdown markings on the dirt runway and reported that they were about 12-feet apart and not heavy impressions.  About 20 feet beyond the second touchdown point, drag markings consistent with a separated main landing gear were found.  The inspector reported that the right main landing gear strut separated near the fuselage with a transverse fracture.  A majority of the fracture face appeared dirty and rusty, with the remaining portion exhibiting a pattern of beach markings and a chevron-like pattern near the edge opposite the discolored portion.  According to the operator, this airplane has been used exclusively for glider tow operations and has accumulated over 4,000 flight hours.  The operator and the FAA inspector estimated the total number of landing cycles somewhere between 15,000 and 16,000 for the life of the part. ",
