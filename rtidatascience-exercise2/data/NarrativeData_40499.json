After the engine was started the pilot cycled the propeller control one time, and taxied to the approach end of the runway.  He reportedly lowered 1 notch of flaps, and applied power noting the maximum torque achieved was 1,650 foot-pounds.  The upper torque limit for the airplane/engine combination was 1,795 foot-pounds.  During the takeoff roll he noted the airplane was \"dragging a little bit\", and noticed the torque decreased to 1,600 foot-pounds.  The flight continued and he reportedly attempted to dump the load in the hopper but was unable to move the handle.  He continued the takeoff and the airplane became airborne, settled onto a road, and collided with trees in an orange grove past the departure end of the runway.  Another pilot for the operator reported that when the airplane went past his position which was approximately 100 feet before the departure end of the runway, he did not recall seeing any flaps extended.  According to the operator, postaccident the hopper dump valve tested satisfactory, and the flap actuator was measured and found to indicate between 0 and 10 degrees of flaps extended.  The airplane flight manual indicates that with the flight conditions experienced, the flaps should be extended 10 degrees.  Examination of the engine and engine components at the engine manufacturer's facility revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.",

After flying familiarization maneuvers for about 30 minutes, the pilot returned to the departure airfield, where he made two preplanned low approaches in order to establish the best indicated airspeed for his first landing. During his third approach, which was intended to terminate in a full-stop landing, the pilot was high on final. He therefore applied right rudder to slip the aircraft in order to lose altitude. Although the pilot eliminated most of the slip as he flared the aircraft for landing, as it floated down the runway, he inadvertently allowed the nose to begin rotating to the right. Then, just before the aircraft touched down, the nose of the aircraft rotated further to the right. The aircraft touched down in a significant right crab and immediately rocked up onto its left main gear. At the same time, it started increasing its rate of turn to the right. About 275 feet from where the aircraft touched down, the left main gear experienced an overload failure, followed immediately by the right. As the right main gear collapsed, it tore a portion of the right wing fuel tank wall loose, and a large volume of fuel was released into the wheel well. As the right wing settled to the asphalt surface, a massive fire broke out, which ultimately consumed the aircraft. It was later determined that the pilot had made only four landings in a tailwheel equipped aircraft in the last year, none of which were in the make and model he was flying at the time of the accident. It was further determined that the pilot attempted the landing in a tailwind of approximately five knots.",
            "probable_cause": "the pilot's failure to ensure the aircraft's longitudinal axis was aligned with the runway prior to touchdown, and his failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll. Factors include landing with a tailwind, and the pilot's lack of recent experience in the particular make and model aircraft.  A factor in the severity of the post-accident fire was the kit manufacturer's inadequate  design, which allowed the excessive side-load failure of a main gear leg to pull a portion of the wall from a wing fuel tank."

An airborne witness in another aircraft reported seeing the accident airplane in level flight with black smoke emanating from it.  The airborne witness then reported seeing the airplane bank to the left and enter a nose down spiral towards the ground.  The airplane impacted flat level terrain in a steep nose down attitude and the post-impact fire consumed the majority of the airplane.  The flight was airborne for about 4 minutes before it crashed.  The on-scene and detailed post recovery examinations revealed evidence consistent with an in-flight fire in the lower aft engine compartment area in proximity to the turbocharger and the adjacent firewall.  Evidence on the nose landing gear strut cylinder suggests that temperatures in this area exceeded the melting point of aluminum while the airplane was in flight.  During the engine examination investigators noted that the tension ring of the turbocharger exhaust clamp that retains the exhaust duct to the turbine side of the turbocharger had fractured at the 11 o'clock position.  The exhaust clamp bolt remained connected and properly safetied.  With this clamp broken and the exhaust ducting loose, hot exhaust gasses would have been directed against the lower firewall.  The examination of the turbocharger exhaust clamp showed a high temperature creep/stress rupture that initiated from a crack at one of the resistance welds that joins the sheet metal retainers to the tension ring.  The turbocharger gases are approximately 1,200 to 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, and the tension ring fracture surface showed intergranular brittle fracture across approximately 80-percent of the cross-sectional area initiating at the resistance weld.  The heavily oxidized resistance weld region, when compared to the lighter oxidized sheet metal, suggested that the weld crack was pre-existing.  A review of past historical Safety Board data revealed three other accidents, FTW98FA325, FTW99LA241, and CHI02FA042, with similar fractures of exhaust clamps, and other referenced data showed that Inconel 718 could crack in an intergranular mode in a time-dependent creep/stress rupture mode in this temperature range.

Axis Jet was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The commercial pilot and the airline transport pilot were not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage by impact forces and the post-crash fire. The cross-country aero-medical positioning flight departed Sacramento, California, about 0500. Visual night meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed.The crew reported that the purpose of the flight was to pick up an aero-medical harvest team coordinator at O22 and fly them to San Luis Obispo, California. The crew reported no anomalies with the flight, airplane, or the approach to land at O22. The flying pilot (FP) was seated in the left seat and the non-flying co-pilot (NFP) was assisting the FP by performing the checklists and reporting speeds and other cockpit information to the FP. The pilots both described the landing as firm. As soon as the airplane contacted the runway, both pilots stated that they heard a loud bang followed by the airplane's belly scraping the runway. The airplane slid down the runway coming to rest on the left side of the runway. They both observed fire on the left side of the airplane near the engine nacelle. The airplane was subsequently thermally consumed by the postaccident fire.Investigators examined the wreckage at the accident scene. The first identified points of contact (FIPC) were three ground scars consistent with the geometry of the main landing gear and the nose wheel. The FIPC was about 100 feet south of the runway on the displaced threshold. The accident site was documented, and the wreckage was recovered for possible further examination.",

On the flight prior to the accident flight, the passengers complained of a smell the pilot thought might be exhaust. After landing, he examined the engine for exhaust leaks. Finding none, he proceeded with the return flight. While departing the airport he heard a loud bang, the passenger cabin started to fill with smoke, and he saw fire at his feet. He reduced the throttle, and landed on the airport runway. In his haste to depart the airplane, he did not turn the fuel off, and he left the electric fuel boost pump on. He said after exiting the airplane, he saw a large pool of fuel forming under the airplane, and smoke continued to emanate from the passenger cabin door. The pooled fuel ignited, burning the airplane. The passengers said they first noticed the smoke in the rear of the passenger cabin, and that the smoke propagated forward until they could no longer see the pilot. During the examination of the airplane, the NTSB investigator found that approximately a 4\" X 6\" piece of the right side exhaust manifold at the rear of the engine was missing. The edges of the manifold, where the piece was missing, had scalloped fractures and long straight tears consistent with fatigue fractures and failure. Additional fractures were found in other areas of the exhaust system. The hot exhaust gasses burned a hole in the heater shroud at the point where it attaches to the scat tubing which provides heated air to the vents in the rear of the passenger cabin. The hot exhaust gasses were deflected by the firewall onto the engine fuel line attached to the engine driven fuel pump mounted on the left rear of the engine, burning the fuel line through. The electric fuel boost pump provided pressurized fuel to the engine driven pump, which resulted in fuel continuing to flow and pooling on the ground. According to airplane records, the exhaust system had been inspected in accordance with the operator's approved inspection program, 2.9 flight hours prior the accident.",

The witness said that during the takeoff run, the nose appeared abnormally high as it lifted off, then \"the wings began to wobble\" as it disappeared behind an area of hilly, tree-covered terrain at the west end of the lake. The airplane subsequently collided with trees, which severed the right wing. It became inverted before colliding with an area of tundra-covered rock. The airplane's wreckage was about 800 feet from the west shoreline. During the NTSB's on scene investigation, the pilot's seat was found in the full aft position. There was no evidence of mechanical problems with the airplane's engine or flight controls during postaccident inspections. An FAA airworthiness directive (AD), 87-20-03 R2, defines the maximum acceptable wear limits on the seat locking mechanism and seat tracks. The AD states, in part: \"...If the wear dimension across any hole exceeds 0.36 inches but does not exceed 0.42 inches, continue to measure each hole every 100 hours for excessive wear. ...If the wear dimension across any hole exceeds 0.42 inches, prior to further flight, replace the seat track.\" The NTSB IIC measured each of the 17 seat rail holes using a McFarlane seat rail wear gauge, revealing that 4 of the 17 holes were in excess of 0.42 inches. The 4 excessively worn holes were the 8th through 11th holes [from front to back]. Using an exemplar Cessna 180 and a pilot that was the same height as the accident pilot, it was discovered that the 9th seat track rail hole was selected after the seat was adjusted to comfortably operate the flight controls. Cessna issued service bulletin SEB07-5, which provides for the installation of a secondary seat stop kit for the pilot seat, free of charge. Compliance is mandatory within the next 200 hours of operation or 12 months, whichever occurs first. The bulletin was issued about 4 months before the accident, and the airplane had flown about 22.4 hours since its issuance. The accident airplane was not equipped with the secondary seat stop kit. Given the lack of mechanical deficiencies with the airplane's engine or flight controls, and the discovery of the worn seat rail holes, it is likely that the pilot's seat moved aft during the takeoff run, making it difficult for him to properly operate the airplane's controls.",

During the circle-to-land contact approach, the pilot was advised by an FAA flight service station specialist at the island airport that the weather did not look favorable for a contact approach due to low clouds and visibility.  A pilot-rated witness on the shore across from the island reported seeing the airplane descend from the clouds and strike the ocean three times before it climbed out of sight.  The witness described the visibility as about 3/4 mile in blowing snow.  The airplane continued to fly for approximately 2.3 miles, until other witnesses near a town on the shore heard the engine stop, and saw the jet and a parachute at a low altitude.  The airplane collided with the ground in a large lot, and continued into an occupied trailer home and parked vehicles.  A postcrash fire ensued.  Inspection of the airplane disclosed no preimpact mechanical problems with the airplane. The loss of engine power was consistent with the water impact which damaged the inlet fan and compressor stator.

The climb and level off at cruise altitude were uneventful and, based on the radar data, appeared to have been accomplished with the use of the autopilot. The cruise altitude of 27,000 feet was the highest the airplane had been flown in recent history, and the highest altitude it had been operated at with the pilot flying. The pilot made a routine radio exchange with air traffic control personnel shortly after levelling for cruise. Five minutes later, the airplane, with no further radio transmissions, rolled to the right and rapidly descended 10,000 feet, where it subsequently broke apart.Both wings, along with the horizontal stabilizer and elevators, separated during the breakup sequence. Analysis of their fracture surfaces, along with the debris field distribution and radar data, revealed that the breakup sequence was most likely inadvertently induced by the pilot, as he attempted to recover control of the airplane during the dive.The airplane sustained extensive thermal damage after ground impact, and examination of the engine components, surviving primary airframe components, the cabin heater, and the autopilot system remnants did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. There was no evidence of bird strike, inflight fire, or that the engine fire extinguisher system had been activated.The airplane was flying toward an uninhabited mountain range and a largely unpopulated desert area at the time of the upset. The moon had set, and the pilot would have had limited reliable external visual cues should the airplane have experienced a failure of either the flight instruments or autopilot. The pilot was instrument rated, however the majority of his flight experience was garnered in aircraft equipped with modern \"glass cockpit\" avionics, as opposed to the traditional flight instruments installed in the accident airplane (which he had recently purchased). The airplane was equipped with a dual vacuum pump system, which drove the primary flight instruments and, in turn, the autopilot. One of the vacuum pumps had failed on the previous flight, and the pilot was unable to get it repaired in time for the accident flight. The dual nature of the vacuum system allowed for flight with a single failed pump, however failure of the remaining pump or associated vacuum system components would have left the pilot to hand fly the airplane, using backup flight instruments, at an altitude perilously close to the limit of the airplane's flight envelope (the maximum altitude was 30,200 feet). Examination revealed that the second pump was most likely operational; however, fire damage precluded an accurate assessment of the operability of the remaining vacuum system components. Although operation of the airplane did not require adherence to a minimum equipment list, the airplane's FAA Master Minimum Equipment List stated that one of the vacuum pumps can be inoperative, provided the airplane is operated under VFR and not operated at night. Given the pilot's overwhelming experience with \"glass cockpit\" instruments, as opposed to the traditional type in the accident airplane, along with the failure of one of the vacuum pumps, he should have reconsidered making the flight, particularly during night conditions.The airplane had experienced multiple anomalies with the autopilot and vacuum system prior to the accident flight. Maintenance records indicated that these discrepancies had been resolved; however, damage to the airplane precluded a substantive confirmation of their operation. Additionally, an oversight by an avionics repair facility 1 week before the accident resulted in the airplane's pitot/static system being inadvertently tested and certified to 20,000 feet, rather than the airplane's service ceiling of 30,200 feet. The relevance of this finding, if any, could not be determined.The airplane was equipped with a supplemental oxygen system; however, maintenance records indicated that the pilot's mask, while operational, had degraded. Additionally, the mask had been relocated to a position behind the pilot's seat, which would have been hard to reach in the event of a rapid decompression. Ultimately, the NTSB was unable to determine the cause of the rapid descent because of the postcrash damage to the airplane systems and components.",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to regain airplane control following a sudden rapid descent during cruise, which resulted in an in-flight breakup. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to make the flight with a failed vacuum pump, particularly at high altitude in night conditions."

Shortly after take-off, the pilot reported to the controller that \"[he] found a problem and that he wanted to check it out on the ground\".  The pilot stated that, he was heading back to the departure airport.  The  air traffic controller offered the pilot, a straight-in approach to the airport.  The pilot declined, and stated that he would do a [normal] downwind to the runway.  During the conversation with the controller, the pilot did not disclose the nature of the problem.  The airplane crashed approximately 4 miles prior to reaching the airport, in a vacant lot.  Radar data revealed the airplane departed the airport and flew the runway heading.   When the airplane was approximately 5 miles from the airfield and approximately 5,000 feet mean sea level (msl), altitude, the airplane initiated a turn to the right.  The airplane continued with a 180-degree turn and then proceeded in a straight line.  During the return flight back to the airfield, radar showed the airplane gradually descending while at a ground speed of 170 knots.  The last radar hit showed the airplane at 2,700 feet, at a ground speed of 160 knots.  The wreckage of the airplane was examined at the accident site on January 11-12, 2007.  A post-impact fire consumed part of the airframe cabin.  All major components of the airplane were accounted for at the scene.  The airplane was found to have impacted the ground in a near nose-down (vertical) attitude.  The airframe was extensively crushed by the impact, in an \"accordion\" style-crushing nose to tail.  The wings remained attached to the airplane and perpendicular to the fuselage; both engines were driven several feet into the ground.  Control continuity to all flight controls was established.  The landing gear was in the retracted position. The flap drive mechanism was located and corresponded to a flap setting of approximately 30 degrees.  Post examinations of the engines and propellers were conducted. The left engine sustained heavy impact damage to the front of the engine, and included a crack in the engine's crankcase.   Both magnetos separated from the engine during the accident sequence; the magneto's had heavy impact damage and would not produce a spark.  Sparkplugs in the left engine were removed and examined.  When compared to the Champion Aviation Check-a-Plug Comparison card, the sparkplugs were worn out normal.  The top sparkplugs had light gray deposits and the bottom sparkplugs were oily in the electrode areas.  No anomalies were noted with the fuel pump or oil pump.   The engine was disassembled, and no pre-impact abnormalities with the engine, cylinder assemblies, or engine components were found. The right engine also sustained heavy impact damage.  Both magnetos, which separated from the engine during the crash, produced spark.  The sparkplugs had similar appearances to the ones installed in the left engine.  During the disassembly of the right engine, no pre-impact abnormalities with the engine, cylinder assemblies, or engine components were found. During the accident sequence both propellers remained attached to their respective engine.  The propeller blades on both engines were \"wrapped\" aft to the engines.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The commercial pilot, who managed the airplane and jointly owned it with one of the passengers, departed from a 3,930-foot-long, asphalt runway on a warm day. Weight and balance calculations, which investigators derived from estimated weights for total fuel, passengers, and cargo loads, determined that the airplane was likely within center of gravity limitations and about 208 pounds below its maximum gross weight. One witness stated that the airplane became airborne near the end of the runway before it began a shallow climb and clipped small branches on the tops of trees that were about 30 feet tall. That witness and others observed that the airplane continued past the trees, made a steep bank to the left, rolled inverted, and nose-dived to the ground. The witnesses' descriptions of the airplane's flightpath and the examination of the debris path and wreckage at the accident site are consistent with an impact following an aerodynamic stall.According to calculations performed using the airplane's published performance data chart, for the airplane's configuration and estimated weight and the density altitude conditions at the time of the accident, the airplane would have required about 3,800 feet on a paved, level runway to clear a 50-foot obstacle with the pilot using the short-field takeoff technique. Although the chart does not make any allowances for an upsloping runway or provide data for a 30-foot obstacle, the runway slope is slight (a 27-foot rise over the entire length) and likely did not significantly increase the airplane's takeoff roll, and interpolation of the data revealed no significant distance differences for the shorter obstacle. However, according to the chart, the 3,800-foot distance is contingent upon the pilot holding the airplane's brakes, applying full engine power with the brakes set, and then releasing the brakes to initiate the takeoff roll. In addition, the airplane's ability to achieve its published performance parameters (which are derived from test flights in new airplanes) can be degraded by a number of factors, such as pilot deviations from the published procedures, reduced engine performance, or increased aerodynamic drag associated with minor damage and wear of the airframe.It could not be determined where on the runway the pilot initiated the takeoff roll or at what point full engine power was applied. However, because the runway was only 130 feet longer than the airplane required (according to its published performance data), there was little margin for any deviations from the published takeoff procedure. Although examination of the engines, propellers, and related systems revealed no evidence of precrash anomalies, postaccident damage precluded engine performance testing to determine whether the engines were capable of producing their full-rated power. Therefore, the significance of maintenance issues with the airplane (in particular, a mechanic's assessment that the turbochargers needed to be replaced and that the airplane's required annual inspection was not completed) could not be determined with respect to any possible effect on the airplane's ability to perform as published. A review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and insurance records revealed evidence that the pilot may have been deficient with regard to his ability to safely operate a PA 60-601P. For example, according to FAA records, as a result of an April 2004 incident in which the pilot landed the accident airplane on a wet grassy runway with a tailwind, resulting in the airplane going off the runway and striking a fence, the FAA issued the pilot a letter of reexamination to reexamine his airman competency. However, the pilot initially refused delivery of the letter; he subsequently accepted delivery of a second letter (which gave the pilot 10 days to respond before the FAA would suspend his certificate pending compliance) and contacted the FAA regarding the matter on Monday, August 2, 2004 (the day before the accident), telling an FAA inspector to \"talk to his lawyer.\" In addition, as a result of the same April 2004 incident, the pilot's insurance company placed a limitation on his policy that required him to either attend a certified PA-60-601P flight-training program before he could act as pilot-in-command of the accident airplane or have a current and properly certificated pilot in the airplane with him during all flights until he completed such training. There was no evidence that the pilot adhered to either of the insurance policy requirements.In addition, the FAA had a previous open enforcement action (a proposed 240-day suspension of the pilot's commercial certificate) pending against the pilot for allegedly operating an airplane in an unsafe manner in September 2003; that case was pending a hearing with an NTSB aviation law judge at the time of the accident.Although the FAA's final rule for Part 91, Subpart K, \"Fractional Ownership Operations,\" became effective on November 17, 2003, the regulations apply to fractional ownership programs that include two or more airworthy aircraft. There was no evidence that the pilot had a management agreement involving any other airplane; therefore, the rules of Part 91, Subpart K, which provide a level of safety for fractional ownership programs that are equivalent to certain regulations that apply to on-demand operators, did not apply to the accident flight. In the year before the accident, the FAA had conducted a ramp check of the pilot and the accident airplane and also conducted an investigation that determined there was not sufficient evidence that the pilot was conducting any illegal for-hire operations.

At the time of partial power loss, the pilot applied carburetor heat, turned on the electric fuel pump, switched from the left to the right fuel tank, and checked the position of the magneto switch.  Following total loss of power, the pilot made a forced landing on a city street which resulted in substantial damage to the aircraft and minor damage to three parked cars and a bus stop passenger bench.  During the onsite investigation, both fuel tanks were found to contain 100LL aviation fuel, and fuel continuity was established between the fuel tanks and the engine carburetor.

The event hosted numerous airplanes, many with a similar tricycle gear design.  The 4,300-hour airline transport pilot reported that the airplane touched down on the main landing gear at approximately 60 mph with full flaps.  The pilot added that shortly after touchdown, during the landing roll on runway 02, the nose landing gear contacted \"an irregularity in the landing surface\" which caused the nose landing gear assembly to fold aft.  Following the collapsed of the nose gear assembly, the propeller struck the ground and the airplane nosed over coming to rest in the inverted position.  The canopy was crushed; however, both occupants were able to egress the airplane unassisted.  Several of the pilots attending the fly-in witnessed the accident and later assisted in the recovery of the airplane from the runway.  A couple of the pilots, who were also builders of the same model of airplane, were able to evaluate the condition of the landing surface, and failed to find any irregularities with the landing surface that could have contributed to this event.  Another witness stated that the grass runway featured a slight 'dip' or grade and the touchdown zone of the runway \"may have been slightly rougher that the rest of the runway.\"  The homebuilt airplane had accumulated a total of 264.1 hours since new, and the pilot reported having accumulated a total of 264.1 hours in the make and model airplane.  In the recommendation section of the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2), the pilot recommends an \"improved design for the tricycle-gear Vans aircraft.\"  The homebuilt airplane is available in two options, tricycle or tailwheel configuration.  A review of the accident data base revealed several similar events involving the tricycle gear configured airplanes.

Some can lead to spatial disorientation. Others can lead to landing errors. Illusions rank among the most common factors cited as contributing to fatal aircraft accidents. Various complex motions and forces and certain visual scenes encountered in flight can create illusions of motion and position. Spatial disorientation from these illusions can be prevented only by visual reference to reliable, fixed points on the ground or to flight instruments. The most overwhelming of all illusions in flight may be prevented by not making sudden, extreme head movements, particularly while making prolonged constant-rate turns under instrument flight rule instrument conditions.

Both of the pilots held commercial pilot certificates, but neither were instrument-rated.  The flight was performed to relocate the airplane to the pilot-owner's home base airport.  No witnesses to the accident were identified.  Visual meteorological conditions existed at the departure airport beneath an overcast sky condition.  Based on an evaluation of the weather conditions, the projected route between the departure and destination, and the impact heading of the airplane, and as the terrain elevation increased, the pilots most likely encountered less maneuvering room between the terrain and the overlying clouds, and they would have inadvertently entered instrument meteorological conditions.  The pilots reversed course to a westerly direction and commenced flying back toward their departure airport.

He therefore executed a go-around. During the go-around the pilot did not feel the expected sinking of the airplane when he repositioned the cockpit flap control. Because he did not feel the sinking sensation, and because he had not visually confirmed the position of the flaps at any time since entering the pattern, the pilot incorrectly assumed that the flaps were not functioning properly. He therefore elected to make his second landing with the flaps still in the position they were at after the go-around (ultimately determined to be 10 percent). During the second approach he inadvertently landed about 80 percent of the way down the runway, and then attempted to stop the airplane with maximum braking. During the braking attempt, the brake on the left main gear did not provide any braking action. Before the pilot could get it stopped, the airplane departed the end of the runway, impacted a fence, and nosed over onto its back.

When the temporary certificate was issued, the FAA inspector who issued it told the pilot not to take off on runway 31 until the required 40 hours had been flown off, since to do so might take the aircraft over the town of Homedale, a congested area. At the time the pilot made the decision to take off on runway 13, there was a left quartering tailwind of about 10 knots, gusting to around 15 knots. Although the pilot was aware he was taking off with a tailwind, he did not want to wait until the wind died down, and since he could not take off to the north because of the FAA restriction, he elected to attempt the southerly departure (runway 13).

Postmortem examination of the pilot revealed severe coronary arteriosclerosis with a total occlusion of the right coronary artery, greater than 90 percent stenosis by atherosclerortic plaque of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and 50 percent stenosis by calcified atherosclerotic plaque of the left circumflex coronary artery.",

He leveled the wings and applied full engine power. The pilot turned further in an effort to avoid a populated area and toward a low point in the rising terrain. The airplane then entered a valley located between rolling hills, at which time the airplane started to sink. The airplane's right wing struck a tree and the airplane subsequently impacted the ground. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with the airplane.",
