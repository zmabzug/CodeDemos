The pilot attempted to correct the yaw, but was unable to overcome the \"stiffness\" of the right anti-torque pedal.  The helicopter continued to yaw left, landed \"hard,\" and rolled over.  Examination of the helicopter's hydraulic system revealed that the hydraulic pump drive shaft splines and the attaching drive coupling splines were severely worn, to the point that they could no longer drive the hydraulic pump.  Metallurgical hardness testing of both the drive shaft and the coupling revealed that the surfaces of the splines were below the manufacturer's specified hardness.  Examination of the grease found trapped between the remaining portions of the hydraulic shaft pump splines revealed that it was hard packed and gray colored, suggesting that it had been in place for a significant period of time.  The minimal amount of grease observed in the coupling sleeve did not satisfy the \"generously filled\" description referred to in the manufacturer's service bulletin, and required by a subsequent airworthiness directive.  Examination of the helicopter's maintenance records revealed that since the issuance of the airworthiness directive, the helicopter had not been in compliance with either the calendar or flight time requirements.  The helicopter's flight manual cautioned pilots operating the helicopter without hydraulic assistance, \"Do not attempt to carry out hover flight or any low speed maneuver.

Based on the finger\u00a0tight condition of the right elevator attachment hardware and the lack of any mechanical damage to the hinge fittings of the left elevator and stabilizer hinge\u00a0structure, it is likely that all four sets of attachment hardware for both elevators were not properly torqued during the AD maintenance 54 days earlier.

About 30 minutes into the flight, the airplane changed its heading twice with accompanying rapid changes in altitude. Shortly thereafter the airplane began a rapid descent and collided with steep mountainous terrain. According to radar analysis of the flight conducted by a Safety Board meteorology specialist, the first-half of the flight took place under visual meteorological conditions; however, during the remainder of the flight the airplane most likely entered both a wave cloud and a layer of broken-overcast clouds that bordered the flight path. Strong northwesterly winds normal to mountain ridges existed in the general area at the time of the accident.

The 18 airplanes were divided into two groups, and each group had a leader. The accident airplane served as a separate leader for the entire group and departed about 10 minutes before the other two groups to make arrangements at their next destination and to check weather along their intended route of flight, which took them through a mountain pass. One of the group leader pilots reported that, as he\u00a0approached the mountain pass, weather conditions began to deteriorate with low clouds, haze, and restricted visibility. He subsequently received a radio broadcast from another airplane in the area, which indicated that the mountain pass was not open due to poor weather conditions, so he chose to land his group at a nearby airport. The other group leader pilot stated that, after hearing that the first group was going to land at the nearby airport, he also chose to land his group there. The accident airplane\u2019s fragmented wreckage was discovered near the summit of the mountain pass in an area of brush and tundra-covered terrain at an elevation of about 2,370 feet mean sea level near the area where the second group leader turned around.

The airplane was owned by Flying Colors Aviation LLC, and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The commercial pilot and pilot rated passenger sustained fatal injuries and the airplane was destroyed during the impact sequence. The local flight departed Felts Field at 1553. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed.The airplane had just undergone an annual inspection at the facilities of Rocket Engineering, and the accident flight was to be a post-maintenance test flight. Both the pilot and passenger were employees of Rocket Engineering, and the planned flight time was about 40 minutes.Audio and preliminary radar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) captured the entire flight sequence. The accident was also observed by multiple witnesses at the airport, along with air traffic control personnel in the control tower.The airplane departed from runway 4L, and radar data indicated that almost immediately after takeoff it began a climbing 10 degree turn to the right. After flying on that heading for about 1.5 miles, the airplane began a more aggressive turn to the right, reaching 1,000 ft above ground level (agl) while on a southbound heading. The tower controller asked over the traffic advisory frequency, if everything was ok, and the pilot responded, \"that's negative\". The airplane's turn radius then tightened to about 700 ft, and within about 45 seconds it had turned an additional 270 degrees while descending about 600 ft. Control tower personnel stated that during this period the airplane was banking about 90 degrees to the right and descending, and that they assumed it was about to crash. A short time later the bank angle began to reduce, and the airplane appeared to recover. The airplane then began a meandering climb to the east, and about 2 1/2 minutes later the pilot reported, \"We are trying to get under control here, be back with you\".The airplane eventually reached the town of Newman Lake, about 11 miles east of the airport, having climbed to about 5,600 ft mean sea level (4,000ft agl), and the pilot reported, \"things seem to be stabilizing\", and when asked his intentions by the tower controller he replied, \"We are going to stay out here for a little while and play with things a little bit, and see if we can get back.\"The airplane began a gradual left turn, and the pilot requested and was approved for a straight in landing for runway 22R. The airplane became aligned with the runway about 7 miles east of the airport, and a short time later the controller asked the pilot the nature of the emergency, to which he responded, \"We have a control emergency there, a hard right aileron\". The flight progressed, and a few minutes later he reported that the airplane was on a three mile final. The airplane remained closely aligned with the runway centerline throughout the remaining descent, and control tower personal stated that having reached the runway numbers the airplane appeared to be flying in a 20 degrees right wing low attitude.The tower controllers along with multiple witnesses reported that as the airplane passed close to taxiway D the engine sound increased and the airplane began a sharp roll to the right. It subsequently collided with the river just north of the airport.Both wings along with the horizontal stabilizer and elevators separated during the impact sequence, and the forward cabin sustained crush damage through to the area of the main wing spar. The river was about 25 ft deep at the accident site, and all major airframe components sank within a few minutes of impact. The airplane was recovered by a diving team from the Spokane County Sheriff's department over a two day period during the week following the accident.",

The helicopter received substantial damage and performed a precautionary landing to the runway, while the airplane received minor damage and performed a go-around and subsequently landed uneventfully. The flight instructor and private pilot receiving instruction in the helicopter were not injured. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) designated pilot examiner (DPE) and commercial pilot on board the airplane were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for either instructional flight, both of which were conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.The pilots in each aircraft provided written statements, and their statements were consistent throughout. The pilot in the airplane was undergoing a certificated flight instructor practical test from the DPE, and the airplane-rated pilot in the helicopter was receiving primary rotary wing instruction.Preliminary radar information from the FAA revealed that both aircraft were operating in the traffic pattern at LNA prior to the accident. The airplane was performing left-hand traffic patterns, while the helicopter was performing right-hand traffic patterns.The helicopter maneuvered around the right-hand traffic pattern and was established on a shallow final approach for a run-on landing to runway 33. About the same time, the airplane was on a left downwind, with the applicant pilot preparing for a power-off descending turn for the same runway.The DPE stated that while the airplane had been conducting left-hand traffic patterns, he and the applicant had observed other helicopters in the right-hand pattern completing their approaches parallel and to the right side of runway 33. In light of these operations, the DPE advised the applicant that the airplane would remain clear of the helicopter, and to continue the approach and landing. Once the airplane entered the turn and while on final approach, the DPE's view of the helicopter was blocked by the cabin and right wing. Witnesses observed the airplane overtake the helicopter from above and behind, heard the contact, and watched the helicopter enter a rapid, controlled descent to the runway. The airplane banked sharply, the engine accelerated, and the airplane completed a go-around.A review of the recorded radio communications revealed that the helicopter transmitted position reports on the downwind, base, and final legs of the traffic pattern. The airplane transmitted position reports for the crosswind and downwind legs.The airplane pilot/applicant held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued September 16, 2014. He reported 677 total hours of flight experience, of which 22 hours were in the accident airplane make and model. The DPE held an airline transport pilot certificate with multiple type ratings and flight instructor certificates with multiple ratings. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued January 16, 2014. The DPE reported 33,164 total hours of flight experience, of which 234 hours were in the accident airplane make and model.The flight instructor in the helicopter held commercial pilot and flight instructor certificates with ratings for airplane single engine land, multiengine land, rotorcraft-helicopter.

The loss of rotor thrust support caused the rotor to displace aft and contact adjacent stationary structures, including structures in the No. 2 bearing area. The resulting machining-type contact damage generated metal debris that contaminated the engine oil. Metal particles in the oil scavenged from the No. 2/2.5 bearing oil cavity damaged the engine oil pump and arrested its rotation, which caused torsional separation of the oil pump driveshaft, cutting off oil supply to the engine. The left engine oil pressure master warning activated. The flight crew did not shut down the engine. The engine operated 84 seconds without oil flow, until combustor and turbine component fire damage disrupted combustor flame stability and the engine flamed out. The continued operation without oil flow elevated engine operating temperatures, and the No. 5 engine bearing cavity temperature increased beyond the material properties of the No. 5 bearing seal runner. The seal runner expanded radially and caused a hard rub against the (titanium-alloy) No. 5 bearing flexible support. The local temperature at the  contact point  rapidly reach its ignition temperature. The resulting titanium fire consumed the No. 5 bearing flexible support and progressed to adjacent thin-walled titanium components, including the diffuser diaphragm. Molten titanium droplets falling onto diffuser exit ducts located directly beneath the No. 5 bearing area melted through three of the exit ducts and penetrated the gas generator case.  The titanium fire self-extinguished when the conditions required for sustained titanium combustion were altered by the flameout and the case burn-through. The lack of circumferential titanium droplet distribution, the undamaged condition of the diffuser ring bore internal surfaces, and the gravity-driven nature of the case penetration indicate that the titanium fire originated external to the diffuser/engine gas path. The cockpit engine fire warning remained active when no fire was present because one of the nacelle fire/overheat detector elements was unable to reset due to a permanently deformed switch diaphragm.",

A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that, when the right rudder pedal was in the neutral position and the brake was applied, it held pressure.

Subsequently, he chose to land the airplane between two houses. A postaccident engine compression test revealed that the Nos. 1 and 4 cylinders had low compression. The No. 1 rocker cover was removed, and the rocker arm was tapped with a mallet, which brought its compression to within normal range.

The pilot did not report performing any of the procedures to return the engine to service from indefinite storage (that is, more than 90 days). Therefore, it is also likely that the engine was never prepared for indefinite storage and, thus, was not stored improperly for the 6 months it was not used before the accident flight. During storage, the No. 4 intake and exhaust valves most likely became lodged in the valve guides, which resulted in a partial loss of engine power and subsequent forced landing to a field.

The return trip was planned for Sunday, but the pilot canceled that flight due to winter weather conditions. Also due to weather concerns, he booked a Monday return to Minnesota via commercial airline. However, that commercial flight was canceled for non-weather reasons, and the pilot chose to return in his airplane. He contacted flight services twice by telephone to obtain weather briefings and filed a flight plan. Both weather briefings included AIRMETs for mountain obscuration, turbulence, and icing along the planned flight route and altitude. About 2 hours after the second call, the pilot filed a second instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan by computer, with a proposed departure time 10 minutes after the filing time. About 20 minutes after filing, the pilot was issued a clearance that differed from the one he had requested. The differences included a departure to the south instead of the north, an off-airway segment, and a clearance altitude 5,000 feet higher than originally requested. The assigned altitude was lower than and counter to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published requirements for the area in which the pilot was flying, but neither the pilot nor the controller questioned the altitude assignment. The airplane departed 8 minutes after the clearance was issued.About 30 minutes after takeoff, when the airplane was on the off-airway segment, radar coverage from the Rock Springs Air Route Surveillance Radar was lost because the system at the FAA facility that was handling the airplane was intentionally made unavailable to controllers due to data reliability concerns. However, controllers at another FAA facility that was not handling the airplane continued to successfully use that same data. Four minutes later, the pilot filed a report with flight services that he was encountering light turbulence and a trace of rime icing. About 6 minutes later, the airplane was reacquired by ground radar. The controller then asked the pilot to climb to 16,000 feet, the minimum IFR altitude in that sector. Two minutes later, the pilot reported that he might not be able to reach 16,000 feet. About 2 minutes after that, the pilot reported that he was in a \"severe mountain wave,\" and that he was \"descending rapidly.\" There were no further communications from or radar targets associated with the airplane. The wreckage was located 7 days later, at an elevation of about 11,000 feet. Damage patterns were consistent with impact while the airplane was in a left spin. Examination of the engine and airframe did not reveal any preexisting mechanical deficiencies or failures that would have precluded normal operation.The pilot appeared intent on returning home that day and had made alternate travel plans, which were foiled for reasons beyond his control. His repeated checks of the weather and multiple flight plans indicated that he was attempting to take advantage of the continuously changing conditions and depart in his airplane as soon as a short-term window of opportunity arose. This self-imposed time pressure, coupled with his lack of recent IFR experience, likely resulted in his acceptance of the non-conforming clearance. While the pilot was responsible for accepting a clearance that did not comply with minimum instrument altitude requirements, air traffic control (ATC) services were deficient in not ensuring that the clearance complied with FAA requirements. The controller should have been aware of the minimum instrument altitudes in his area of responsibility and ensured compliance with them. The decision of the FAA facility handling the airplane to not utilize certain radar data diminished the performance of the minimum safe altitude warning system by preventing the system from detecting a hazardous situation and depriving the controller of a timely altitude alert, which might have enabled him to better assist the pilot. The airplane took off at or near its maximum certificated gross weight. Although the information was available to him, the pilot was either unaware of or discounted the fact that the clearance route that he was issued and accepted required a minimum altitude near the performance limits of the airplane, and that altitude was significantly higher than the altitude he had requested. The altitudes filed for by the pilot and assigned by ATC were also above the freezing level and in forecast icing conditions. The assigned altitude also required supplemental oxygen for all four persons on board, but the onboard system was only configured for two persons. Meteorological information indicated that IFR conditions, turbulence, and icing were likely present in the vicinity of the descent, and possibly more significant than previously reported by the pilot. It could not be determined whether the airplane was actually in a mountain wave, but the pilot was unable to arrest the airplane\u2019s descent. Those factors, combined with the small difference between the airplane's stall speed and best climb speed, likely resulted in the stall and subsequent spin of the airplane. Although it would not have aided the airplane occupants in this case, if the airplane had been equipped with a 406-MHz emergency locator transmitter, it is likely that the time and resources expended to locate the wreckage would have been significantly reduced.Based on the findings of this accident, the NTSB issued three safety recommendations to the FAA. Safety recommendation A-11-32 asked the FAA to \u201cestablish Standard Instrument Departure procedures that provide transition routes and minimum instrument flight rules altitude information for aircraft cleared over commonly used navigational fixes from Jackson Hole Airport and similarly situated airports.\u201d The FAA has established standard instrument departure procedures with minimum altitude information for Jackson Hole Airport and continues to survey other mountainous airports; thus, safety recommendation A-11-32 is classified \u201cOpen\u2014Acceptable Response.\u201d Safety recommendation A-11-33 asked the FAA to \u201cmodify en route automation modernization software such that en route minimum safe altitude warning alerts are provided for aircraft in coast track status that are receiving automatic position updates.\u201d Safety recommendation A-11-34 asked the FAA to \u201cmodify en route automation modernization software such that cautionary warnings are provided to controllers when an aircraft is predicted to enter a minimum instrument flight rules altitude (MIA) polygon below the MIA.\u201d The FAA is researching whether the en route automation modernization software can be modified to address safety recommendations A-11-33 and -34, which are classified \u201cOpen\u2014Acceptable Response.\u201d",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's decision to depart into known adverse weather conditions over mountainous terrain, which required operation near the limits of the airplane's performance capability and which resulted in a loss of airplane control and subsequent ground impact. Contributing to the accident was an improper clearance issued by the air traffic controller and the pilot's acceptance of that clearance. Also contributing to the accident was the extended loss of radar data from the Rock Springs Air Route Surveillance Radar, which caused loss of radar contact and consequent loss of minimum safe altitude warning protection for the flight."

The airline transport pilot and commercial-rated co-pilot were not injured, and the airplane was not damaged. The airplane was registered to North Florida MBA Investments LLC, and operated by Gulf Atlantic Airways, Inc., dba University Air Center, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a positioning flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated from TPA about 0836, and was destined for Gainesville Regional Airport (GNV), Gainesville, Florida.The captain stated that they had flown that airplane on 3 previous legs that day and there were no related issues on any of the flights. After landing at TPA 10 minutes earlier, they offloaded the passengers, and prepared to depart for GNV.The co-pilot was the pilot flying from the right seat, and before departure they performed the pre-takeoff briefing. The flight departed and at 400 feet at V2 plus 10 knots they retracted the flaps and turned to the right for the published departure procedure. At that time the co-pilot said the controls were stiff and he was feeling push back. He (captain) advised him twice to trim the forces away and noticed his arms were fully extended pushing on the control yoke. He too assisted on pushing the control yoke and tried using the electric pitch trim but that did not work. He also attempted to use the manual pitch trim but that too did not work. Simultaneous to that he hit the trim disconnect in case there was a trim runaway, and pulled the pitch trim circuit breaker, but the secondary pitch trim was still frozen. He again tried the manual pitch trim and again there was no effect. He did not feel it was a runaway trim issue.He declared an emergency with air traffic control, and reduced power aggressively but this caused a slight pitch up (normal). He then added power, then slowly reduced power and when the airspeed was less than 200 knots, lowered the flaps to the approach setting. When the airspeed was less than 172 knots the landing gear was extended, and them the flaps were placed in the landing position. He stated that when they slowed the airplane was more controllable with respect to pitch as the pitch setting was set to the takeoff range. The controller asked if they wanted to perform an ILS approach to runway 19L to which they advised the controller that the flight was VFR and they wanted a visual approach to the runway. They flew downwind, base and final and the flight landed uneventfully at 0844.Postincident inspection of the airplane revealed one internal jack screw (part number 5565450-45) of the left elevator trim tab actuator assembly was fractured.

The accident site was located 1.5 nautical miles southeast of the last radar return at an elevation of 7,928 feet msl.

A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.\u000b\u000bIt could not be determined if the pilot obtained a weather briefing for the flight. The most recent pilot report before the accident indicated cloud bases at 9,000 feet in the accident area. Weather returns depicted light-intensity echoes over the route of flight consistent with reduced visibility in light rain and extensive vertically developed clouds. Therefore, although weather conditions at the departure and destination airports were VFR, available weather information indicates that the accident airplane likely encountered instrument meteorological and mountain obscuration conditions en route.

The flight continued beyond his estimated time of arrival as he tried to identify landmarks. He then reduced power and looked for a suitable landing site to check the fuel because the fuel gauge indicated that between zero and 1/4 of his fuel reserves remained. He initiated an approach to a field for a precautionary landing, but noticed that it was not suitable and he began to climb out when the engine lost power. He executed a 180-degree northerly turn and lined up for a forced landing in a field with standing water. While flying at 45 to 50 knots with the first notch of flaps lowered, he noticed a power line and applied aft elevator control input to avoid it. After clearing the power line, the nose of the airplane dropped and the airplane impacted the field. The right main landing gear wheel assembly dug into soft ground, causing the right main landing gear wheel assembly to separate. Postaccident inspection of the airplane and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Six gallons of fuel were found in the fuel tank.

About 15 minutes after takeoff, the engine began to lose power and then quit.  The pilot made a forced landing on a small lake, but collided with trees before touchdown.  The pilot said he departed with 10 gallons of fuel, and noted that the right wing fuel gauge was indicating 1/4 full.  After landing, the pilot said that the right fuel gauge was still indicating 1/4 full.  The following day, the pilot began to drain the fuel tanks and discovered that both wing fuel tanks were empty.  He eventually drained about 2 gallons of fuel from the fuel system.  The left wing fuel indicator was an original float-type rod.  The right wing tank quantity indicator was installed in the airplane by a mechanic under a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), about 4 months before the pilot purchased the airplane.  The STC utilizes a \"U\" shaped, clear segment of plastic tubing, which functions as a visual column indicator (sight gauge) of the tank's fuel level.  The installation instructions for the sight gauge include the installation of a length of fuel hose between the ends of the sight gauge, and the fuel tank outlets.  The length of the hose is not specified in the STC, only stating, \"as required.\"  During a postaccident examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector, the pilot and a mechanic noted that they found an excessively long length of fuel hose between the lower sight gauge attach point, and the lower fuel tank outlet.  They stated the  length of hose was arched upward between the two points of attachment, allowing fuel to be trapped in the lower end of the sight gauge.",

The UAL604 co-pilot looked out the window and saw the A320 moving at a fast rate toward the runway, aborted the takeoff, and advised the controller that they were aborting their takeoff for the crossing traffic.  The co-pilot stated that they did not get above taxi speed during their departure.  Separation was lost with closest proximity of approximately 600 feet, the distance from approach end of runway 4L to taxiway H. AMASS did not activate.",

The C90 sustained substantial damage, and the Falcon 2000 sustained minor damage. The C90 airline transport pilot, and the two airline transport pilots and two passengers on the Falcon 2000 were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the proposed cross-country flights, which were both to be conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.According to the pilot of the Falcon 2000, subsequent to the preflight and the before takeoff checklist being completed, and with the parking brake set to ON, a ground handling crewman pulled the wheel chocks from the landing gear. The pilot reported that as soon as the chocks were removed, the airplane starting rolling across the ramp. The pilot stated that he immediately applied the toe brakes, however, they were not effective in stopping the airplane. He then applied the emergency braking system, but that too was ineffective in slowing or stopping the airplane. The pilot added that as the Falcon continued across the ramp, its right wing went over and scraped the top of the left wing of a parked Falcon 50 before colliding with the Beech C90 in a near head on collision with its radome.",

However, he was flying in an erratic manner away from the pipeline he was suppose to be patrolling.  In telephone communications with the pipeline company, he seemed \"weird and disorientated.\"  The airplane collided with trees and was destroyed by impact and post-impact fire.  Examinations of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures.  Post-accident toxicological tests on specimens from the pilot found a blood ethanol level of 373 mg/dL (0.373 percent), and a urine ethanol level of 556 mg/dL, indicating that the pilot's blood level had been higher than 0.556 percent at some time within the previous 6 to 8 hours.  Toxicology tests also detected a very high level of citalopram, a prescription antidepressant, and its metabolites in the pilot's blood, consistent with either ingestion of larger than typical amounts or accumulation of the substance as a result of liver impairment.  On his most recent FAA application for a medical certificate less than one month prior to the accident, the pilot reported one Driving Under the Influence (DUI) conviction, which occurred less than 1 year prior to the accident; the FAA medical records contained no details of that DUI, but a review of publicly available court documents for the conviction noted that the pilot's blood alcohol concentration was 0.31 percent during that arrest.  The pilot denied any history of alcohol dependence, abuse, or of mental disorders on his most recent application for medical certificate, though his employer was aware of his attendance at a rehabilitation program due to alcohol problems in 2006.  The FAA specifically disqualifies pilot applicants with a history or clinical diagnosis of substance dependence, which is defined in 14 CFR 67.107, 67.207, and 67.307 as \"evidenced by (A) increased tolerance, (B) manifestation of withdrawal symptoms, (C) impaired control of use, or (D) continued use despite damage to physical health or impairment of social, personal, or occupational functioning.\"  Had the FAA obtained details regarding the pilot's DUI conviction and/or contacted the pilot's employer, the FAA would have been aware that this pilot met the FAA's definition for substance dependence, and he likely would have not been issued a medical certificate without having undergone thorough evaluation and additional treatment.",

The operator stated that, before the fuel delivery, the airplane was loaded with about 180 gallons of aviation fuel and that, after arriving at the airstrip, the pilot got out of the airplane, connected a hose and transfer pump system to the bulk fuel tank, and operated the transfer pump for about 5 minutes. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that all 180 gallons of fuel were still in the bulk fuel tank. According to the operator, the pilot did not open the drain valve to allow the tank to drain nor did he verify that the tank was empty before departing.

A passing motorist saw the tail of the aircraft sticking out of a lake and notified authorities.  Crush lines on the recovered wreckage disclosed that it impacted the water right wing low with a pitch attitude in excess of 45 degrees nose down.  No preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures were identified. The pilot rented the airplane and flew 47 miles to the mountain resort airport, landed, met some of his future in-laws, and loaded three of them onboard for a local sightseeing trip around the lake.  He obtained his fixed wing private certificate 2 weeks prior to the accident, and this was the first flight with passengers.  During training, he had only 1 flight involving a high-density altitude airport, with the balance of his training conducted at airports with elevations less than 1,000 feet msl.  The density altitude at the accident site was 5,400 feet.    The lake is in an oval shaped mountain valley 25 miles long by 15 miles wide surrounded by mountains, which rise 3,000 to 4,000 above the water's surface.  The town and the airport are at the northwest end of the lake.  The town borders the airport to the north, and mature pine trees that are 50 to 60 feet in height surround the field and provide obstacles for an approach or departure on any runway but 16/34.  The airport manager said that because of the terrain and obstacles, and the proximity of the noise sensitive town to the north, pilots typically land on runway 34 and takeoff on runway 16.  While he could not be certain, the airport manager believes the airplane departed on runway 16.  The location of the wreckage would be consistent with an upwind to crosswind turn point for runway 16.    The aircraft was found in a takeoff and initial climb configuration.  Based on the aircraft's recording hour meter and the stopped electric clock, the accident occurred in the initial climb from takeoff on runway 16.  The performance data for the airplane establishes it would have climbed to between 400 and 500 feet agl as it reached the accident location.  Using flight planning charts for the airplane, the elapsed time on the recording hour meter does not support a conclusion that the pilot completed a run-up or had any appreciable ground run time prior to the accident takeoff.    Between 1500 and 1600, the airport's automatic weather observation station recorded winds from 289 degrees at 9 mph with peak gusts to 23 mph.  The system only records the highest peak wind gust during the hour-long observation period; however, it does not record the time of the wind peak.    Surface winds are affected by friction and Coriolis deflection, which will produce an average increase in wind speed of 10 mph at the boundary between the layer next to the surface and the free flow layer above, which is typically about 400 feet agl.  Coriolis deflection will cause the wind direction to change clockwise at the boundary, with a typical direction change of 10 to 20 degrees.  Katabatic wind effects in mountainous areas can result in a rapidly moving air mass, which if an inversion layer is present, may flow over the lower layer.  Therefore, the takeoff roll on runway 16 would have been with a right quartering tailwind, which moved closer to a direct tailwind and increased in speed as the aircraft climbed through 400 feet.  Considering the recorded peak wind speed, it is likely the aircraft encountered a rapid change in wind velocity by as much as 25 to 30 mph.  The flaps-up stall speed at zero degrees of bank is 44 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and 47 KIAS with 30 degrees of bank angle.  Normal initial climb segment airspeed is 74 KIAS at 5,000 feet msl. ",
            "probable_cause": "The pilot's encounter with a wind shear at low altitude, which resulted in a loss of control and a stall/spin.  Factors in the accident were the high density altitude and the pilot's lack of experience and training in high density altitude operations.  The pilot's decision to takeoff downwind, while reasonable given the nature of the obstacles and terrain on the other runways, set up a situation where decreased safety margins existed and is considered a factor.

            "narrative": "NTSB investigators either traveled in support of this investigation or conducted a significant amount of investigative work without any travel, and used data obtained from various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.The pilot/owner had recently purchased the multiengine, high-performance, complex airplane. He had obtained his private pilot certificate 15 years before the accident and had limited flight experience, having amassed a total of about 118 hours of flight time. He had obtained his multiengine rating 5 weeks before the accident, and his total flight experience in multiengine airplanes was about 40 hours. Of that time, 18 hours were logged in the accident airplane of which 3 hours were while acting as pilot-in-command.On previous flights, the airplane's rear engine had been \"stuttering\" as the throttle was advanced. The pilot was able to forestall the problem by advancing the throttle slowly; however, the symptoms had been getting worse. A maintenance facility at the departure airport attempted to troubleshoot the engine problem but was not able to resolve the issue. Thus, the pilot intended to reposition the airplane to another airport where a different maintenance facility had agreed to continue the diagnosis. He planned to fly the airplane in the traffic pattern, perform a touch-and-go landing, and proceed to the other maintenance facility if the airplane performed correctly. He had also made plans to depart that night on an important and time-sensitive business trip to Europe from an airport close to the second maintenance facility.The departure for the initial flight appeared uneventful; however, during the approach for the touch-and-go landing, the pilot seemed distracted, missing multiple landing clearances issued by an air traffic controller. The airplane landed and used the full runway length for the ground roll, while making \"popping\" sounds similar to an engine backfiring, indicative of at least a partial loss of engine power. Having reached the end of the runway, the airplane lifted off and climbed to about 150 feet above ground level, and a short time later the pilot issued a mayday transmission. The airplane maintained the runway heading and the same altitude for about a mile and then began a descending right turn, striking a set of power distribution lines and a building. The length of the runway and its overrun area would have provided ample stopping distance for the airplane after the landing. Further, the area between the runway and accident site was comprised of level fields which would have been adequate for an emergency landing.The majority of the airplane's structure was consumed by postimpact fire. The front engine's propeller displayed considerable rotational damage, consistent with it producing power at the time of the accident. The rear propeller exhibited less significant rotational damage signatures, consistent with it operating at a reduced power level. The rear engine sustained thermal damage, which precluded a determination of the reason for the loss of power.Postaccident examination of the front engine revealed that the right magneto was set to an incorrect timing position. The left magneto had broken free during the impact sequence, so its timing position could not be ascertained. If the left magneto had been set to the correct timing position, the incorrect timing of the right magneto would have resulted in a minimal loss of engine power. Additionally, although no damage was noted to the right magneto, it is possible that it became misaligned during the impact sequence. Lastly, because the engine was producing power at the time of impact, it is unlikely that both magnetos were misaligned.Performance charts indicated that at the airplane's takeoff weight, a total loss of engine power from the rear engine should have allowed for an adequate takeoff profile, assuming the emergency procedures detailed in the Pilot's Operating Handbook for the airplane had been followed. However, examination revealed that the procedures had not been followed because at the time of impact, the flaps were not completely retracted, and the rear engine's propeller was not feathered. Although the pilot had the minimum experience required to fly the multiengine airplane, he had only acted as pilot-in-command of this airplane for 3 hours; and when he was faced with an emergency, he likely did not have the proficiency and confidence to readily deal with it. The pilot was likely distracted during the landing (as supported by the missed radio calls), failed to abort the landing and continued with his original plan to takeoff despite the loss of engine power, and was unable to appropriately configure the airplane for flight with only one engine operable after the takeoff.",
            "probable_cause": "Loss of engine power from the rear engine for reasons that could not be determined because of the postimpact thermal damage to the engine. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's decision to continue flight with a known deficiency, his failure to abort the takeoff during the ground roll, his failure to follow the correct emergency procedures following the loss of power, and his lack of experience in multiengine airplanes and the specific airplane make and model."

ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE PILOT USED ONLY ABOUT HALF THROTTLE FOR THE ATTEMPTED TAKEOFF. THE AIRCRAFT REPORTEDLY SHOULD HAVE LIFTED OFF WITHIN 300 FEET, BUT INSTEAD, IT FAILED TO BREAK GROUND UNTIL IT WAS ABOUT 2,000 FEET DOWN THE RUNWAY. IT CLIMBED TO ABOUT 50 FEET AGL AND THEN THE NOSE PITCHED UP TO ABOUT A 20 DEGREE ATTITUDE AND THE AIRSPEED DROPPED TO ABOUT 30 MPH OR LESS.  IT THEN STALLED AND ROLLED SHARPLY LEFT AND WENT INVERTED. THE AIRCRAFT THEN ENTERED A NEAR VERTICAL NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE WHICH WAS MAINTAINED UNTIL GROUND IMPACT OCCURRED. POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF AIRCRAFT, ENGINE, OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION. LIKEWISE, THE PATHOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE PILOT REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS. ",

She said when she attempted to adjust the RPM '...the engine clunked a couple of times and lost all power.' The pilot made a forced landing on a grassy field.  She said the airplane touched down on the main float wheels that '...dug into the soft ground... .'  The nosewheels touched down and the airplane nosed over on its back according to the pilot.  The airplane's pilot operating handbook states that a '...landing on land without engine power [should be made] with the landing gear UP on soft or rough ground... and DOWN on firm or smooth ground.'  An examination of the engine revealed it had been installed on another airplane before being put onto the accident airplane.  The crankshaft had completely failed at the forward radius of the number 3 main bearing journal.  The number 3 main bearing had shifted forward.  The engine had 1,056-hours since it had been factory remanufactured. ",
